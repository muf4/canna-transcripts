and if you're here i bet you do too just

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,199
about all of my life is purchased

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,039
i start my day with purchased toothpaste

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,199
shave cream and razor

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,960
i work on a computer i bought on

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,599
internet i subscribe to

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
and listen to music i pay a monthly feed

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
access to

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,560
my lunch was bought mostly at the

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,920
grocery and i put my dishes in a

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,839
dishwasher with soap

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,320
someone else made my car my home

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
this microphone i'm talking into nearly

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,520
everything in my life is paid for

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,120
even the organic and holistic stuff but

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,760
my relationship with the plants is

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,439
different

20
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,199
i actually spend very little on

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,320
cultivation and yet my plants are

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
thriving

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
the longer i cultivate and the more i

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,160
learn

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,199
the easier it is to grow the less money

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,439
i spend

27
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,039
and the less pest pressure and problems

28
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,839
i have

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799
for me the beauty of natural farming is

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
the more i

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
slow down and learn about soil life and

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,600
natural

33
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,919
systems the more i am rewarded with good

34
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,959
cannabis and good food for nearly no

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,960
money

36
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,798
because of natural farming my

37
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,359
relationship with my plants is the

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,640
healthiest relationship in my life

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,478

kinds of things that you

155
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,560

00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,439
look at their property do some

176
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
permaculture design work or just look at

177
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,839
it through

178
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,199
you know through my my years of cannabis

179
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,079
and permaculture

180
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
um so over that phone call we usually

181
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,560

farm is this a

186
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,918
traditional market uh cannabis farm is

raise your family and grow food a lot of

197
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
times with talk on the phone

198
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,439
way beforehand coming out to the farm

199
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,038
you know what are the what are the

200
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,959
natural resources you have around there

201
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,000
i'd like to just get a little bit of a

202
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,680
picture before i ever

203
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600
set foot on the ground i like to look at

204
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
maps send me some topos send me some

205
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,280
aerial photos send me your site plans

206
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,280
from your licensing

207
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,879
so that when i go out and finally get

208
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,559
some boots on the ground i have a good

209
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,879
idea you know what neighborhood are you

210
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,478
in

211
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,079
i might know some of your neighbors i

212
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:50,719
might know just from the area that

213
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,560
you're in

214
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
what are some of the natural resources

215
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
there if you're out near the coast

216
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,240
in honeydew or petroleum i'm here in

217
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,399
southern humboldt county

218
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
um you're i know you're gonna have

219
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,959
horsetail on your property i know that

220
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
this time of year you're going to have

221
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,519
brac and fern i already have an idea

222
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
based on

223
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,359
you know where you're at what your

224
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,879
exposure is are you north face or your

225
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,879
south face what kind of

226
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,000
conditions i can expect to see once i

227
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,079
get out there

228
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,839
and so once we get onto that property

229
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,038
believe me i'm looking for plants on the

230
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,519
drive out there

231
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,000
i'm looking for you know history of

232
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,918
fires that have come through the area

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,680
um where are we are we down in a valley

234
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,279
are we up high am i seeing

235
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,879
you know what are the soils looking like

236
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,719
as i'm driving out to your property get

237
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,439
an idea are we down in lake county and

238
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
there's

239
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,079
serpentine rock or are we up in northern

240
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,120
humble where there's redwood trees you

241
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,199
know so

242
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,680
we get onto the property meet with the

243
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,879
clients and some of the first things we

244
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,840
like to identify

245
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,039
are these different sectors where is

246
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,799
your exposure

247
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,079
are we on a south-facing property that

248
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
gets a lot of

249
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,519
gets a lot of sun gets really good

250
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
southern and western exposure are we on

251
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,598
a north-facing property that gets very

252
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,318
little light

253
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,918
what's our elevation where is the water

254
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,000
on this property

255
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,359
where are the fire threats coming from

256
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,720
on this property you know

257
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,199
most of humboldt county is very

258
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,039
mountainous and fire tends to travel

259
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,759
uphill so it's usually pretty easy to

260
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,519
identify

261
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,000
where are the fire threats going to come

262
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,439
from on a property you know if you're in

263
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,879
your house where's that fire

264
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,519
what direction is that fire going to be

265
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,360
coming from where are the ingresses and

266
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,279
egresses from that property and

267
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,439
will you be able to exit it if there is

268
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,119
a fire coming your way

269
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,958
some of these other sectors are the wind

270
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
sectors you know where are your winds

271
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,158
blowing in from

272
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,839
you know winds can be very damaging to

273
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,000
soils and to plants they really dry out

274
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,680
soils

275
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,679
they make it a lot harder for your plant

276
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,199
to just be healthy and do its natural

277
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,799
processes so

278
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
identifying these sectors

279
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
we use a lot of we use some skills in

280
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,039
permaculture called

281
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,319
zoning these are some principles that we

282
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,480
use where we can

283
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,800
lay a farm out or a property out in

284
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,360
zones zones one through five with some

285
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,919
zone ones being the zones that you visit

286
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
the most

287
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,719
every day these are gonna be the areas

288
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,839
right outside your front door where

289
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
you're gonna want your little hou your

290
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,120
little veggie garden for the house and

291
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,199
your little bit of herbs and your

292
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,720
chicken coop and zone 5

293
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,480
is going to be the very far reaches of

294
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,240
your property it might be a wood lot or

295
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,039
it might be an area that you go just to

296
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,639
gather

297
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,719
you know gather some leaf mold out of

298
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,559
the forest a few times a year

299
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,759
so we'll we'll look at a property and

300
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,399
we'll look at you know

301
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,838
what are the uh what is your day-to-day

302
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,399
look like you don't want to put your

303
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,519
garden

304
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,759
that you're going to be visiting every

305
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,519
day on the far end of your farm

306
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,519
you want to put that close to the house

307
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,039
so we use some of these permaculture

308
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,360
design principles

309
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,079
and they really help with that process

310
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,839
and

311
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,759
and really just identifying those

312
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,959
sectors where are the threats where the

313
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,958
assets

314
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,319
how do we capture the energy that's

315
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,239
hitting your farm

316
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
and cycle it as many times before it

317
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,839
leaves your farm that energy could be

318
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
the sunshine hitting it

319
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,279
meaning we want to have as many levels

320
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,360
of plants we want to have tall trees

321
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,078
that are capturing that sun at a tall

322
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,079
height

323
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,078
we want to have medium-sized plants and

324
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,120
ground covers that we're capturing that

325
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,719
sunshine

326
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,919
at every height before it leaves the

327
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
property we want to capture it with

328
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,679
solar panels

329
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,278
we want to capture it with uh passive

330
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,078
solar design on our home

331
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:20,159
so it can heat them during the winter we

332
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,838
want to capture the rain water as it's

333
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,639
falling and hitting the ground that's

334
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,920
energy

335
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,919
we want to cycle that through our

336
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,719
property as many times before it leaves

337
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,240
we want to

338
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,759
run it through swales that are going to

339
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,360
spread the water out and sink it into

340
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,039
the ground and our hugelbeds are going

341
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,440
to capture it and hold that water like

342
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,439
banks

343
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,600
and those plants you know we want to

344
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,320
cycle that water through as many plants

345
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
before it leaves our farm that's energy

346
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,959
and the minute it leaves your farm it's

347
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,559
gone so how do we how do we identify all

348
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,039
the all that energy that's hitting your

349
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,479
property and make the most use of it

350
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,078
you know one of the big things we say in

351
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,159
permaculture is

352
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,278
what's the biggest change we can make

353
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,199
for the smallest

354
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,799
effort so we really go out to these

355
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,240
farms we try to identify you know what

356
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,479
is what are what are some of the

357
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,440
few biggest issues you're dealing with

358
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
and we might be able to

359
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,880
you know if we can just fix those couple

360
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
little things that could have a huge

361
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,360
impact on your life or on the healthier

362
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,600
farm or on the quality of your product

363
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,360
and oftentimes out here those those

364
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,959
little things they're big things they're

365
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,480
little things but oftentimes it's

366
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,919
powdery mildew

367
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,000
or it's certain types of pests a big big

368
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,759
aphid issue the last few years the leaf

369
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,078
hoppers was a big issue i saw the last

370
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,360
couple

371
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,199
years so yeah we just you know it's

372
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
really about the farmers context what

373
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,160
are we walking into what

374
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,519
what are your goals that you're trying

375
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,159
to accomplish

376
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,879
and how can we use uh these design

377
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,639
principles

378
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,519
and your available resources to meet

379
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,240
those let's get into the farmer's head

380
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,879
for a second

381
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,278
so so i can see how and actually i gotta

382
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,320
admit i'm kind of surprised at how

383
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,559
um systemic um

384
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,639
the approach is right i can i can almost

385
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,278
feel the permaculture design

386
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,079
course that that that these ideas are

387
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,639
from because

388
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,319
you know so often when people come to

389
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
the property they're focused more on how

390
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,600
the property

391
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,639
feels to them right and the energetics

392
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
of the property and

393
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,159
and i'm you know obviously that is

394
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,120
important but to

395
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,600
but to listen to you break it down into

396
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,399
like the

397
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,399
types of zones i'm i'm imagining more

398
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,240
like

399
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,000
overlaid you know different types of

400
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,759
maps of what's happening at different

401
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,639
levels of the property

402
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,399
and and how you can improve each one of

403
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,399
those different categories so so

404
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
getting into the farmer's head for a

405
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,120
moment

406
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,159
when you go to these properties what are

407
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
like let's let's just pick three um what

408
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,679
are three of the

409
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,519
common uh let's say either

410
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:50,799
misconceptions or things that farmers

411
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,320
miss

412
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,838
that can be most beneficial um

413
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,959
to them that you see that are very

414
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
common because if they're if they're

415
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,439
common to you chances are a lot of folks

416
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,719
that are listening

417
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,600
will get value from them as well

418
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,079
well yeah let's let's start with winter

419
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
time

420
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,319
we see people making these huge burn

421
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,399
piles and just burning everything

422
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,040
burning their stalks burning their plant

423
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,799
waste burning their tree trimmings

424
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,319
where you know we're in fire country

425
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,399
here we had the largest

426
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,240
fire in california history about four

427
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,078
miles from my house last year

428
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,360
um we're we're in a major drought right

429
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,799
now we're going to have an even worse

430
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,800
fire year this year

431
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,559
so we all need to be doing uh fire

432
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,479
prevention work over the winter creating

433
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,000
these defensible spaces they call them

434
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,920
clearing out around our buildings

435
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,399
clearing on the downhill sides of all

436
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,719
our

437
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,159
buildings all our entrances and exits to

438
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,399
the property

439
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,000
and so it's great we want people

440
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,919
clearing these fire ladders these are

441
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,720
the lower dead branches on trees

442
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,639
clearing out the

443
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,639
clearing out the dry material but when

444
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,600
we just burn those those are valuable

445
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,360
resources

446
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
those are resources on your property

447
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,039
when we burn them we're releasing co2

448
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
into the atmosphere it's adding to the

449
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,159
hole in the ozone layer

450
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,399
there are many things that we could do

451
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,879
with our cannabis stalks with our plant

452
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,759
with our

453
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,879
ganja waste with our tree thinnings with

454
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,360
our

455
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,159
with these small furs that we tend to

456
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
thin out here

457
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:16,480
in our oak woodlands when we

458
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,959
stockpile and process these wastes we

459
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,879
turn them into resources

460
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,879
so let's talk about your cannabis waste

461
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,000
let's talk about your ganja stocks those

462
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,240
can be chipped

463
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
those can be returned to your soil they

464
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,879
can be composted

465
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,759
they can be used as mulch

466
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,919
dry dry leaf as well can be just mulched

467
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:42,240
compost right back into the garden

468
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,679
fed to your worms put into a hugelkultur

469
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,519
bed

470
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,039
those are valuable materials i don't

471
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
ever want to see anybody burn in their

472
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,759
ganja stocks again that one breaks my

473
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
heart

474
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,519
yeah it's fun we all love sitting around

475
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,240
the campfire in the winter it's great

476
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,759
but let's not burn our cannabis waste

477
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
those are nutrients that we took from

478
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,000
the soil from our soil

479
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,919
we need to return them to the soil every

480
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,519
time we we harvest something and remove

481
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,759
it from our property that that's

482
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,120
that's fertility we just removed so we

483
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,198
got to start thinking about how do we

484
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,278
return that back to the soil

485
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,958
as far as our forest thinnings you know

486
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,879
a lot of those young furs can be

487
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,439
processed and used as poles we can use

488
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,399
those as

489
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,000
junk junk pole fencing is very simple

490
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,720
wooden fences that we can build out of

491
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
those

492
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,240
four to eight inch diameter

493
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,240
straight poles fur dug fur poles

494
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,600
your your thinnings out of the woods can

495
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,799
be chipped

496
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,040
used used to build soil using your

497
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,039
compost used as mulch

498
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,240
i also want to talk about raymeal wood

499
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,958
chip these are the

500
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,399
branches from the the smaller deciduous

501
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,039
trees you want to harvest these

502
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,320
in in the winter time and in the

503
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,000
springtime

504
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,680
these are the trees your deciduous trees

505
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,078
that lose their leaves in the in the

506
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,838
winter

507
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,879
time these are your fruit trees these

508
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,880
are your oaks these are your madrones

509
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,399
and your maples these are some of the

510
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,278
the deciduous trees around

511
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,799
our parts you want to you want to use

512
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:07,679
the branches that are under three inches

513
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,439
in diameter

514
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,039
the smaller thinner branches that have

515
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
some bend to them these are high in

516
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,838
lignin lignan is what makes

517
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,919
branches flexible when these branches

518
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,680
get older they get high in tannins

519
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,159
tannins are what's in hardwood makes the

520
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,479
wood hard makes it hard to bend so when

521
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,600
you

522
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,839
chip these smaller ramu ramiel wood

523
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,519
these smaller branches we use our fruit

524
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,399
tree thinnings and we use these smaller

525
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,919
branches

526
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,799
when you make a wood chip from this

527
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,759
ramel wood it's a very

528
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,519
low carbon to nitrogen ratio wood chip

529
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,759
and that means it's going to break down

530
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,959
quickly your normal hardwood wood chip

531
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,360
high in tannins

532
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,439
takes a long time to break down you bury

533
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,278
it it's going to take a couple of years

534
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,639
this ramiel wood chip because it's

535
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,838
smaller pieces

536
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,120
it's high in the lignin microbes love to

537
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,680
break this stuff down

538
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,039
you want to use this as a as a

539
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,399
essentially a top dressing you want to

540
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,319
use it as a mulch

541
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,558
and if you can mix it into the top one

542
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,038
inch layer of your soil and when it gets

543
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,959
some

544
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,640
contact with the soil the microbes move

545
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,160
into it start breaking it down

546
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,839
it's not going to absorb and lock up a

547
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,000
bunch of nitrogen like your normal wood

548
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,918
chip if you were to mulch with it

549
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,038
so ramuel wood chip is something we

550
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,959
should all be

551
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,558
making all winter long building

552
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,480
fertility

553
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,279
another good use for that wood waste is

554
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,558
biochar we should all be making biochar

555
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,960
all winter long and

556
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,200
using all these wood resources so yeah

557
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,120
big pet peeve of mine is seeing people

558
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,200
burning their fertility burning their

559
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,399
wood resources let's please put an end

560
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,880
to that

561
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,840
right on what's it what's another one

562
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,320
another big one i see

563
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,199
you know we've got snakes out here and

564
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,000
we have

565
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,759
fires so we all do a lot of weed

566
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,359
whipping out here the grass grows up

567
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,720
real tall in the spring it's beautiful

568
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,798
in green and then it dies and you're

569
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
left with this waist-high grass that is

570
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,639
a real fire threat

571
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,320
and it really hides a lot of the snakes

572
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720
we got rattlesnakes around here i had a

573
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,200
client

574
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,279
uh last month whose father got bit back

575
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,319
last year by a rattlesnake so it does

576
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,519
happen

577
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,079
um but i'm going to put in a little plea

578
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,599
here

579
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:20,000
to not weed whip down to the ground

580
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,599
all around your garden i'm going to talk

581
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,720
to you right now about something we call

582
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,599
beetle banks and beetles are

583
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,600
some of the unsung heroes of your garden

584
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,359
beetles go in and they break down

585
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,359
manures they're incredible they're

586
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,439
incredible decomposers

587
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,519
so they go in and they break down your

588
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,080
soil they break down the

589
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,798
the compost and break down the manures

590
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,240
and

591
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,319
where they like to hang out is in the

592
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
tall grass they go in there and hide in

593
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,798
the tall

594
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,720
shady grass during the daytime to hide

595
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:49,839
from birds and to hide from other

596
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
predators

597
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,959
and when we weed whip down to the bare

598
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
soil

599
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,519
all around our gardens and we don't

600
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,880
leave one little patch of grass standing

601
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,960
we have just taken out a lot of habitat

602
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,720
and so we have to find a balance between

603
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,400
making our properties fire safe

604
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,640
and getting that dead grass down where

605
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,120
it's important and leaving as much of

606
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
these

607
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,399
undisturbed areas as possible so i'm

608
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,400
doing a lot of this in my garden this

609
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,960
year is leaving big strips

610
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
un un-weed whipped right now and that

611
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
means just

612
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,079
native grasses and bunch grasses that

613
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,080
are three four feet tall

614
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,759
and they're a shady habitat for these

615
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,399
bugs and snakes

616
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,839
and all kinds of insects to hide out

617
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
during the day during the hot part of

618
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,399
the day when they're easy prey

619
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,119
and you know you want to have a diverse

620
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
garden diversity is strength

621
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,719
diversity is health when you go into

622
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,038
your garden you should see every bug

623
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,079
every insect that means an aphid and a

624
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:47,759
spider mite

625
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,279
that means it's a healthy a healthy

626
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,519
balanced system that means there's

627
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,200
predators there keeping them in check

628
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,879
if i walk into a farm and i don't see

629
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,400
any bugs i get worried i know people

630
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,919
have been spraying or there's just not

631
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,840
enough diversity there there's nothing

632
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,440
there that anybody wants to live on

633
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,240
and that's gonna that's gonna lead to

634
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,080
pest pressures and pathogen pressures

635
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,919
you know when people when people weed

636
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,839
whip their entire property

637
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,120
um it's it sometimes reminds me and is

638
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,399
kind of akin to

639
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,079
lawns right um and i understand why

640
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,840
people have gotten more aggressive

641
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,439
around about you know weed whipping

642
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,959
their properties simply because

643
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,320
they don't want their properties to burn

644
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
right people are like okay i want to

645
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,639
have there be

646
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,320
less fuel around my house and and by all

647
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,360
means you know around your house you

648
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,798
want to make sure that you

649
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,558
you know you you've got things cleared

650
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,918
but it doesn't mean that you necessarily

651
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,079
need to clear

652
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,080
you know every square foot of of your

653
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,158
entire parcel you know there's

654
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,918
there's there are gradations here and i

655
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,720
think that it's important to understand

656
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,520
that it's not

657
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
all or nothing yeah and you don't need a

658
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,038
lot of these i'm not saying leave the

659
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,759
whole hillside untouched i'm saying

660
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,158
leave a four

661
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,839
foot wide by 20 foot long strip of

662
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,600
native grass in the middle of your

663
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,119
garden or on the edge of your garden or

664
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,798
on the uphill side where it's not going

665
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,038
to be a fire threat

666
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:03,918
and uh you're saying more like make

667
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,400
islands

668
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,000
make islands these beetles will travel

669
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,240
100 feet in every direction

670
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
so make these islands around your garden

671
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,279
and put a water source there put a

672
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,279
little pond there

673
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,639
if you've got drip emitters put a saucer

674
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,359
under a few of those throughout your

675
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,200
garden

676
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,558
you're going to get a lot more wildlife

677
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,240
you're going to get a lot more snakes

678
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,918
they're going to be eating your rodents

679
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,279
a lot of times when we get rodent damage

680
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,960
here they're looking for water

681
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,960
they're chewing the base of your stems

682
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,400
and extracting moisture

683
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,480
and i find that when i leave out more

684
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,120
water around my garden they leave my

685
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
cash crops alone

686
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,038
so what's uh what's another thing that

687
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
you you see commonly for this third one

688
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,759
what's something common that you see

689
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,960
that that uh you know it's kind of a

690
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:49,679
universal thing that folks do wrong

691
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,798
well a lot of the pest pressures we get

692
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,600
are just because

693
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,558
of let's talk poor air flow and mono

694
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,279
cropping

695
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,119
and uh unfortunately we've got an issue

696
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,079
here in humboldt county for the licensed

697
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,399
growers where they

698
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,918
charge them for their square footage of

699
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,360
their pathways in between their

700
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,080
cultivation areas

701
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,558
so it really encourages the farmers to

702
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,000
pack

703
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,279
everything in as densely as possible and

704
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,720
it leads to

705
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,558
a lack of air flow an increase in pest

706
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,558
and

707
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,918
and and fungus pressures and i'm

708
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,319
specifically talking about

709
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,000
powdery mildew has just gotten worse and

710
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,599
worse and worse here

711
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,119
and yeah when you don't have good air

712
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,959
flow and you're not taking the time to

713
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,639
go in and clean out the insides of your

714
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,319
plants and the bottoms of your plants

715
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,360
and certain strains you've really got to

716
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,759
clean them out because they're just too

717
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,759
leafy

718
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
yeah powdery mildew and and a lot of

719
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,679
that just has to do with

720
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,200
a lot of times people are in poor

721
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,440
greenhouses without adequate air flow

722
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,679
um just being in the in in the correct

723
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,519
structure or being in the in the correct

724
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,000
outdoors

725
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,918
you know people just kind of stack the

726
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
deck against themselves when you go into

727
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,640
a greenhouse that it doesn't have

728
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,640
adequate air flow

729
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,600
and you've got a mono crop in there and

730
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,720
you've got a strain that isn't used to

731
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,558
these conditions

732
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
and you're growing it near the coast i

733
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,200
mean you're just creating a perfect

734
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,640
storm for pathogens to move right in

735
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,000
and just run rampant all over your crop

736
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,640
so to the to the best of your ability um

737
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,319
you know spread out your plants just you

738
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,559
know across the entire property whether

739
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,359
they're your ornamentals or they're your

740
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,839
cash crop

741
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,279
or whether or not it's your food garden

742
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,000
you know

743
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,399
don't don't be shy about maximizing your

744
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,640
space by spreading out give everybody

745
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,880
a room to breathe absolutely absolutely

746
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,840
let's um let's segue a little bit over

747
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,840
to uh

748
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,079
water you know we talked a lot about the

749
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,879
path of water and the importance of

750
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,000
of you know capturing and sequestering

751
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,520
water

752
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,440
several episodes back when we talked

753
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,918
with nicholas from

754
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,360
green source gardens right and and we

755
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,080
talked with him a lot about

756
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:06,158
um you know what to do in the off season

757
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,519
to prepare your property

758
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:12,159
for for the following summer

759
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,440
and um and and one of the interesting

760
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,480
things that you just said to me was

761
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,960
you're like okay

762
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,159
you know obviously we need to sequester

763
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,798
as much water as we can

764
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,760
on our property as it flows through the

765
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:25,359
property

766
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,440
but then i i forget exactly the word you

767
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,719
use but you suggested that you want to

768
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,679
cycle it back around and you know i

769
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,558
really thought that

770
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,559
water you know essentially travels one

771
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,440
direction through the property usually

772
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,918
uphill downhill and you want to try to

773
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,919
grab

774
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,000
and and cause as much of that water to

775
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,038
sit down as possible

776
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,038
along its one-way path but

777
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,720
but the however you built your sentence

778
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,919
it kind of suggested to me that you're

779
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,038
seeing

780
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,440
you know some way to to circle the water

781
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,000
back

782
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,440
onto your property a second time and so

783
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,759
i'm just kind of fishing here

784
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,960
um you know what what what are these

785
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,759
techniques that you might be talking

786
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,319
about where

787
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:09,919
we can not only just capture the water

788
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:13,119
as it goes by but maybe bring it back

789
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,159
well certainly it's more about

790
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,959
capturing it and using it as many times

791
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,200
as we can

792
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,319
before it would leave the property or go

793
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,600
somewhere like

794
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,278
underground or we can't use it as easily

795
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,038
you know in permaculture one of the

796
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,079
principles is designed from

797
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,839
patterns to details and and and

798
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,879
permaculture's whole philosophy is

799
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,678
around

800
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,240
uh the the philosophy that nature knows

801
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,159
best

802
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,759
and that when we mimic these patterns

803
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,039
that we see in nature we can build

804
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,079
resilient systems that are going to

805
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,759
stand the test of time

806
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:48,000
and function without our input so

807
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,839
water flows downhill we know this this

808
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,839
is a big pattern in nature

809
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,439
you know this is why you don't want to

810
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,119
put your water storage at the bottom of

811
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,400
your hill you want the water storage at

812
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,599
the top of your hill

813
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
this is why you want all your water

814
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,439
catchment at the top of the hill

815
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,759
so things like swales things like hugels

816
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,759
you know a swale is essentially a long

817
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,158
ditch on contour it runs

818
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,119
level across the landscape perfectly

819
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,120
level

820
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,119
water is going to hit that hit that in

821
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,719
the rainy season hit your hill or just

822
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,558
come flowing off a road

823
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,798
it's going to flow into that swale which

824
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,119
is essentially just a ditch

825
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,558
and gets slowed down if it doesn't hit

826
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,798
that swale it's just

827
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,240
coursing down your property probably

828
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,000
going into a ditch probably picking up

829
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,480
speed taking a lot of topsoil with it

830
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and

831
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,558
pushing it right down into your creek as

832
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,119
quick as it can so what we want to do is

833
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,278
is capture that water and slow it down

834
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,239
so that it's going to sink into our into

835
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,319
our

836
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,159
into our water table and recharge our

837
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,599
our stores for our wells

838
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,640
our groundwater stores so it hits that

839
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,558
water it

840
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,240
spreads out and then we want to have

841
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,879
overflows at the ends of those

842
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,120
so that it's going to overflow in and

843
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,039
run downhill into the next swale system

844
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,399
or into the next set of hugel beds that

845
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,240
are on contour

846
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,080
and by doing this we can really slow

847
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,278
this water down and we can capture it as

848
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,639
many times

849
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,319
before it leaves the property we want to

850
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,360
have diverse plantings on all those

851
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,200
swales

852
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,119
and ideally we want to stack functions

853
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,480
and get as many uses out of each one of

854
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,798
these

855
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,558
swales or plantings as possible so

856
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:19,359
ideally we put you know ideally when we

857
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,678
went out there we

858
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,599
identified here's a sector that we want

859
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,600
to generate some privacy the neighbors

860
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,398
drive by it's a dirt road it's a lot of

861
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,158
dust

862
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,639
there's they can see my greenhouse i

863
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,320
need some privacy

864
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,000
we're going to build that swale so it

865
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,398
catches the water coming up

866
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,599
coming off of that road and we're going

867
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,759
to plant our

868
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,759
privacy fence along there and our shade

869
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,879
fence and maybe that's also heavy winds

870
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,440
coming through there we're going to do

871
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
an

872
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,558
intense planting that's going to break

873
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,320
up the wind we're going to try to stack

874
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:49,759
as many functions as we can into that

875
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,519
one planting

876
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,038
and we're not going to just use trees

877
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,879
that are just going to be blocking the

878
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,119
wind and the dust we're going to also do

879
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,799
fruit trees so we can get another yield

880
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,119
we can stack another function out of

881
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,240
these

882
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,519
out of these these elements and we're

883
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,880
not just going to grow a fruit tree

884
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,359
we're going to grow a vine growing up

885
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
that

886
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,959
fruit tree that fruit tree is also

887
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,720
serving purpose as a trellis

888
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,240
so we're just every element that we

889
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,798
place we want to try to stack as

890
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,399
many functions as possible because this

891
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,918
is once again mimicking nature

892
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,599
this isn't something i came up with this

893
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,759
is what happens when you go and

894
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,038
walk in in the forest you see trees with

895
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,398
vines growing up them

896
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,798
you don't see a trellis in the forest

897
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,319
so yeah how many times can we capture

898
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,000
that water and

899
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,599
cycle it cycle it cycle it before it

900
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,880
just sinks down into our

901
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:39,359
into our groundwater systems right on so

902
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,520
you know i know that with your expertise

903
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,719
in permaculture design we could actually

904
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,639
do an entire show

905
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,640
easily on how to design a property

906
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,759
you know when you before you buy it or

907
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,360
when you buy it

908
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,879
um but that's not the nature of the show

909
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,558
today today we're going to be talking

910
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,360
more during the second and the third

911
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,278
sets about wild crafting nutrition

912
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,798
and and discouraging pests with your

913
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,640
local plants

914
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,158
but you know the important thing for me

915
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,919
for this first section was

916
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,159
to um you know kind of pull from you

917
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,320
the like i was saying earlier your your

918
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,240
eyes and how you're seeing the property

919
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,558
and and pull out some general things

920
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
that just about everybody can use

921
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,678
and i would think that there's a lot of

922
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,399
folks like me

923
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,278
who are hearing these these permaculture

924
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,678
ideas

925
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,278
and going you know damn i wish i would

926
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,480
have known this

927
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,240
before i set up everything i already

928
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,798
have set up right

929
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,440
and because you know very very it's it's

930
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,558
so much

931
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,240
easier to design and

932
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:44,398
build um a parcel before you've moved

933
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,200
all your crap onto it right

934
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,239
and so before we go to commercial i'd

935
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,759
like to have you

936
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,759
um speak to this idea of i don't know

937
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,720
but either the challenges or even the

938
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,679
hopelessness

939
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,759
that a farmer may have with gosh i've

940
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,480
already moved on to my property i think

941
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,119
it should be

942
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,399
designed an entirely different way now

943
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,199
that they've done

944
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,519
some permaculture education and research

945
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,558
and

946
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,278
gosh they feel frustrated because you

947
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:15,278
know

948
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,519
they have to plant with the property

949
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,679
that they have today and it's not at all

950
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,639
how they would have designed it

951
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,519
so when you you know when you're talking

952
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,320
with farmers

953
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,480
who are feeling challenged with where

954
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,278
they're at today

955
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,519
versus where they want to go what kind

956
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:37,679
of stuff do you say to them to give them

957
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,519
heart yeah well

958
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,798
certainly the last few years around here

959
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,480
have been really disheartening for

960
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,240
people as they've transitioned into the

961
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,360
recreational market you know

962
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,399
um it's just taken such a financial and

963
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,398
emotional toll

964
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,839
and not just on the farmers but on the

965
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,239
whole community

966
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,158
and so you know these farmers having

967
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,759
their farm and their homestead was a

968
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,120
dream come true for a lot of these guys

969
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,720
a lot of them worked for decades to get

970
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,079
this and build this and

971
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,600
and these last couple years of

972
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,839
regulation have just taken the wind out

973
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,599
of their sails it's become a job and a

974
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,439
burden and it's scary and it's a lot

975
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,319
more work than it used to be and

976
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,399
so to get to come out to folks property

977
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,000
and teach them a few new skills and a

978
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:17,839
few new ways to look

979
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,519
at their property differently and look

980
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:20,879
at their plants and recognize that there

981
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,960
are all these resources

982
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,960
readily available to them and um

983
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,240
once you you know once you get somebody

984
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,360
a little more excited about their

985
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,200
property and

986
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,719
you know the light returns to their eyes

987
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,200
the little sparkle comes back

988
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,720
and they start realizing oh my god you

989
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,240
know i'm spending all this money on this

990
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,600
fertilizer and all this money on this

991
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,200
pesticide and

992
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,879
you know learning a few of these a few

993
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,360
of these techniques could really put

994
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,799
some dollars back in the pocket and

995
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,398
and it just gets people looking at their

996
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:49,519
property with a whole new set of eyes

997
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,479
and a whole new

998
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,640
you know a whole new enthusiasm and it's

999
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,200
been really fulfilling and

1000
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,880
and um you know i'm really just happy to

1001
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,880
see people in the emerald triangle

1002
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,720
embracing regenerative practices

1003
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,399
knowing that this needs to be part of

1004
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,319
our brand we've always been known for

1005
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,239
the best cannabis in the world

1006
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,720
well now we can prove that we're using

1007
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,120
the cleanest and most respectful

1008
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,000
to the planet cultivation practices

1009
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,239
possible so

1010
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,919
i feel like people in this community's

1011
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,319
product as much as it's always been on

1012
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,440
the top shelf are really going above and

1013
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,960
beyond

1014
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,440
in developing these regenerative

1015
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,640
practices and i'm just really happy to

1016
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,399
see uh

1017
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,919
see this renaissance that we're that

1018
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,759
we're witnessing right now

1019
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,759
let's take a little let's let's take one

1020
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,359
more question into the psychological

1021
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,158
part right because for a lot of folks

1022
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,038
you're right

1023
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,919
um you know legalization has been um a

1024
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:43,038
drag for

1025
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,000
most of us and for for many of us

1026
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,640
you know were it's been you know family

1027
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,960
tradition

1028
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,880
and and the heritage behind it the

1029
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,000
cultural connections we're losing as

1030
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,360
well

1031
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,359
and also there is the idea that okay

1032
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,278
they are you know we are getting more

1033
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,959
regenerative minded we are learning

1034
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,319
these new techniques we are learning

1035
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,759
ways that we can use

1036
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:08,558
local plants and save money on inputs

1037
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,079
and oh my gosh it takes a lot of work to

1038
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,200
do that from where i'm at

1039
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:13,759
today and um i'm assuming that that

1040
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,080
you've got

1041
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,960
you know some kind of you know prepared

1042
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,199
philosophy

1043
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,278
to tell you know farmers about you know

1044
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,519
you know some some version of baby steps

1045
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,000
and

1046
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,839
and small things uh you know start with

1047
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,119
some small things but

1048
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,639
what do you do when they feel

1049
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,199
overwhelmed because you're right you

1050
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,840
know there

1051
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,759
there is something about regenerative

1052
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,599
that is becoming stronger in the market

1053
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,440
that people want to buy it

1054
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,959
but that doesn't really get people over

1055
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,399
the fact that yeah

1056
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,120
if i do all of this other new work

1057
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,319
to make my far more regenerative i can

1058
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,798
save more money

1059
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,158
and it's a you know marketing advantage

1060
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,278
but it's also

1061
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,200
more work and and and i'm sure that

1062
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,839
there are others like me

1063
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,440
who feel frustrated about well i already

1064
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,319
have to take care of the garden and the

1065
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,038
property as

1066
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,558
it is and i want to make all these

1067
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,558
changes and i could do that as a

1068
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,358
full-time job for the next year

1069
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,639
how do you um you know how do you

1070
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,719
encourage

1071
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,320
balance and to take these additional

1072
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,559
steps for farmers

1073
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,559
who like we've already established are

1074
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:22,398
feeling pretty beat up right now

1075
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:24,559
yeah absolutely well i absolutely

1076
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,000
discourage people from trying to bite

1077
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,199
off more than they can chew

1078
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,960
i i you know compliance alone on a farm

1079
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,078
is a full-time job for a lot of these

1080
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,838
folks that you know

1081
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,359
farming was their full-time job and now

1082
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,078
they have to be the lawyer and the

1083
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:41,440
consultant and the water expert

1084
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,280
um so i go on to these licensed farms

1085
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,878
and i teach people these practices and i

1086
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
tell them let's start small this year

1087
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,358
let's

1088
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,800
let's talk about converting 10 or 15

1089
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,960
percent of your farm

1090
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,560
let's build one hugel and dump out one

1091
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,398
row of these smart pots you know because

1092
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,000
yeah building a hugel is a lot more work

1093
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:57,838
than getting a smart pot and filled it

1094
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,358
up with soil it just is

1095
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:00,880
but it's also you're going to build this

1096
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:02,400
thing one time and you're building

1097
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,680
fertility that's gonna you know if we

1098
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,760
build it correctly that could last the

1099
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,078
next 20 to 50 years your grandkids could

1100
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,560
be

1101
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,760
pulling potatoes out of that same bed

1102
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,199
and that ain't gonna happen with your

1103
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,599
smart pot

1104
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,358
so i just encourage people take it slow

1105
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,880
because it's hard to teach an old dog

1106
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:17,440
new tricks you know we all did this up

1107
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,079
here for

1108
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,039
you know 30 years and and had really

1109
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,599
good success

1110
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,440
but scaling up going from a quarter acre

1111
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,880
to an acre or going from a half acre to

1112
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,599
two or three like a lot of people here

1113
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,838
have done

1114
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,079
has been a difficult process all the

1115
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,159
problems we had before we have them on a

1116
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,560
much larger scale now

1117
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,319
and so i just encourage people let's

1118
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,759
start small i want them to prove it to

1119
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,519
themselves that it works

1120
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,880
but i also want them to actually follow

1121
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,400
the protocols

1122
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,160
there are some traditional ways to make

1123
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,800
these there are some protocols to follow

1124
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,239
that that will

1125
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,480
and you know give you a better chance of

1126
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,159
success i don't want to see people

1127
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,440
half-assing it and then they say oh it

1128
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,799
didn't work and i'm going to go back to

1129
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,559
the old ways

1130
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,400
you know it does take some effort it's

1131
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,480
not as easy as just throwing some plant

1132
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,920
in a bucket with some water as everybody

1133
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,760
thinks

1134
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,559
it almost is but it's there's a couple

1135
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,240
more important things

1136
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,078
so i hope people will learn some of the

1137
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,559
basics of some of these different

1138
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,839
modalities before they just go all wild

1139
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,000
west and

1140
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,358
yeah do something bad for their property

1141
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,760
or just waste a lot of time

1142
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,679
and effort and go back to the old ways

1143
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,320
yeah the wasting of the time seems to be

1144
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,279
the hardest

1145
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,240
hardest resource to preserve so all

1146
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,480
right cool so

1147
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,679
thank you joey so so when we come back

1148
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,679
after the commercial break we're going

1149
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:34,319
to talk specifically about

1150
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,199
wild crafting uh nutritive plants for

1151
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,000
your property

1152
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,960
so that you can save money on your

1153
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,880
inputs

1154
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,559
you are listening to shaping fire and my

1155
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,280
guest today is regenerative cannabis

1156
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:44,400
consultant

1157
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,640
joey burger

1158
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,639
[Music]

1159
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,799
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1160
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,799
growing is so valued by farmers

1161
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,960
is because the mycelium networks in the

1162
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,760
soil remain established from year to

1163
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,599
year

1164
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,760
and we know these fungal networks are

1165
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,079
essential because they are the nutrient

1166
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,040
super highways that extend far and wide

1167
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,519
in the substrate

1168
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,838
to feed your plants the trouble with

1169
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,119
growing in new living soils or blended

1170
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,039
cocoa substrates

1171
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,440
is that it takes most of the plant's

1172
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,960
life just to create these mycelium

1173
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,920
highways

1174
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,079
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1175

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,480
los and our guest this week is

1342
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,959
regenerative cannabis consultant

1343
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,318
joey berger so before the break we were

1344
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,639
talking a lot about

1345
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,838
how to look at your own property mostly

1346
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,480
just kind of like get

1347
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,639
folks mental eyes into the idea of

1348
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,679
seeing their entire property as this

1349
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:04,159
this living functioning dancing

1350
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:06,318
thing um because it's it's from our

1351
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,480
relationship with it that we create you

1352
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,519
know the the safety of home and the food

1353
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,440
that we eat

1354
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,440
and and hopefully the cash crops that we

1355
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,559
offer to others so that our family can

1356
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,920
survive

1357
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:21,519
but so often um

1358
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,680
we then buy inputs from off the property

1359
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:26,719
that could be easily replaced

1360
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,159
with inputs which might actually be

1361
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,000
plants that are causing us

1362
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:31,838
problems on the property which we could

1363
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,318
actually turn into

1364
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,599
to healthy inputs so why don't you talk

1365
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,358
us through

1366
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,680
you know the kinds of plants that you're

1367
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,199
looking for and and how to see the

1368
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,318
plants on your property

1369
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,159
uh that could be used for um as

1370
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:47,759
as nutritive inputs that could replace

1371
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,920
other stuff that we're buying and

1372
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,040
bringing to the property

1373
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,159
yeah thanks shango i want to bounce

1374
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,838
back one second um to something you said

1375
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,039
when we came back from the break you

1376
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,719
introduced me and you called me

1377
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,400
regenerative cannabis consultant which i

1378
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,159
appreciate that that title helps

1379
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,240
helps let people know that i am open for

1380
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,159
business but i want to talk to people

1381
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,358
for a minute about these titles we give

1382
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,199
ourselves

1383
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,119
and how we can get wrapped up in them

1384
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,639
and how we can feel insecure about

1385
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,800
sharing the knowledge that we have you

1386
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,318
know am i good enough to be called a

1387
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,760
regenerative cannabis consultant and

1388
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:21,519
share this knowledge

1389
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,040
and you know we we call ourselves a

1390
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,838
cannabis grower or

1391
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,679
a permaculture designer or whatever

1392
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,400
these different terms are that

1393
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,919
you know identifies as the singular and

1394
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,440
i want people to

1395
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,760

1401
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,879
for cannabis um when we think of

1402
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,400
ourselves as the activist we are now

1403
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,039
working for a higher power

1404
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,318
much bigger than ourselves a cause much

1405
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,559
bigger than our own

1406
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,480
than the individual when we are think of

1407

so i hope you all will join me in

1413
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,719

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,440
activists for this plant activists for

1415
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:14,799
this planet

1416
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,720
activists for these regenerative

1417
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,800
practices and

pot grower i'm a cannabis farmer i'm a

1420
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,800
permaculturist whatever it is

1421
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,318
you're activists and i've seen the

1422
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,318
passion in this community and

1423
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,000
and the way we've all had to fight every

1424
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,519
step of the way to get this plant this

1425
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
industry to where it is and

1426
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,519
and the fight's not over yet so don't

1427
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,920
think of yourself as the grower

1428
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:38,800
think of yourself as the activist for

1429
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,000
all growers

1430
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,359
and um yeah i just want to send a lot of

1431
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,199
love out there to everyone who's just

1432
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:45,598
been carrying this torch for a long time

1433
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,279
and

1434
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,519
going to jail and fighting the good

1435
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,200
fight and it's far from over but

1436
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:53,119
i just want to put that in everyone's

1437
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,358
head that you all are activists and

1438
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,358
i i respect you i like that so many of

1439
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:57,679
you that is so well said joey you know

1440
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,279
and

1441
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,118
and hearing you say it you know it

1442
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,400
really changes how people ground

1443
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,318
themselves right if they ground

1444
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,358
themselves as

1445
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:09,039
excuse me as a cultivator or whatever um

1446
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,199
they're grounding themselves in how they

1447
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,599
make money versus as an activist we're

1448
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,719
growing we're identifying our

1449
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:19,039
identifying ourselves as um we

1450
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,239
are defenders and growers of natural

1451
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,480
systems right

1452
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,919
which is you know more amorphous than

1453
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,318
what i sell

1454
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,000
but it's probably way healthier overall

1455
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:31,039
and a much better way to identify

1456
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,800
oneself yeah activate activists don't

1457
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,639
have time for haters or trolls

1458
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,079
you know we believe in this mission it's

1459
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,440
much bigger than us and

1460
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,599
uh and we make no no excuses for it so

1461
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,800
right on so what are these plants that

1462
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,160
are on our property

1463
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,760
that we can use in very simple ways to

1464
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,920
feed our plants and replace some of the

1465
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,359
stuff that we normally buy

1466
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,639
sure well you know i practice

1467
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:58,400
a a a few different types of cultivation

1468
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,838
in my toolbox some korean natural

1469
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,920
farming techniques

1470
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,440
and some jadom techniques which is a

1471
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,200
little evolution of korean natural

1472
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,079
farming

1473
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,118
so i came onto a new farm here last year

1474
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,839
new property

1475
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,280
and i came here in march and we start

1476
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:14,799
looking around what are what are the

1477
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,720
things that are starting to grow

1478
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,039
early in the year like that you know in

1479
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,558
march and april here

1480
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,119
some of the first things to start

1481
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,400
vegging are the blackberries

1482
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,480
you know people here consider the

1483
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,960
blackberry invasive it grows on just

1484
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,559
about

1485
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,318
every piece of property in humboldt

1486
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,640
county

1487
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,759
it's hard to pull out it's pokey it's

1488
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,318
scratchy

1489
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,960
but it's incredible habitat for birds it

1490
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:41,759
provides delicious berries

1491
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,039
and it's an incredible fertilizer those

1492
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,200
fast-growing green

1493
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:47,679
shoots in the springtime are full of

1494
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,519
growth hormones they're full of nitrogen

1495
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,519
so one of the very first ferments i make

1496
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,838
in the springtime is that blackberry

1497
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:53,838
ferment

1498
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,880
some of the next plants to come along

1499
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:58,318
are going to be your nettles your

1500
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,039
stinging nettle and your dead nettles

1501
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:04,079
seem to show up in april

1502
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:07,039
i just did a big horsetail harvest over

1503
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,359
the weekend that seems to pop up in may

1504
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,679
horsetail is high in silica good for

1505
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:14,159
building cellular wall strength uh

1506
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:16,318
great for treating powdery mildew i make

1507
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:19,279
a foliar feed i also make a

1508
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,079
a pesticide with it that's also good for

1509
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,359
powdery mildew

1510
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,119
prevention and

1511
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,679
right now we've got the saint john's

1512
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,519
wart blooming which i also use to make a

1513
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:33,279
pesticide

1514
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:36,318
so it's really looking at you know

1515
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,920
what's available right now getting in

1516
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,440
touch with these plants

1517
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,639
what do you have in abundance if you

1518
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,838
only have a little bit of something

1519
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:43,519
don't harvest it

1520
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,039
if we go into these areas i want to make

1521
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,559
sure it doesn't look like i was even in

1522
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,079
there harvesting i'll never harvest more

1523
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,800
than 25 percent of every

1524
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,880
anything if i'm taking some materials

1525
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,240
out of the woods like leaf mold or some

1526
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,760
some leaves or anything i bring

1527
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:57,679
something back into the woods to replace

1528
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,920
it some wood chips or some

1529
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,199
some straw or some some soil or some

1530
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,480
compost

1531
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,679
uh you know we don't want to encourage

1532
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,318
people to just go out to the woods and

1533
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,639
just start

1534
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,079
harvesting and and you know extracting

1535
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,440
these resources

1536
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,519
we need to do it in a way that's

1537
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,280
actually beneficial you know i talked

1538
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:14,960
before about the permaculture principle

1539
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,960
of stacking functions

1540
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,159
so we don't just go and cut these plants

1541
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,240
willy-nilly

1542
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,759
you know i probably if i've got a bed in

1543
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:22,879
my garden that's overgrown with

1544
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,800
blackberry well those are the

1545
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,280
blackberries i'm going to use

1546
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,039
to uh to make this ferment we had a

1547
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,240
class here on friday we had about 40

1548
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,159
people here we did a little natural

1549
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,399
farming class on our farm

1550
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,759
and i made this blackberry ferment and i

1551
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,760
took them over to where the blackberries

1552
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,040
were all growing into the pathway and if

1553
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,160
you walk by them they'd reach out and

1554
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,838
they scratch you

1555
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,598
and those are the branches that we made

1556
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:44,719
the ferment out of we stacked our

1557
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,079
functions instead of just

1558
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:47,358
clearing those and cutting them and

1559
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,359
throwing them somewhere we made a

1560
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,358
ferment out of them

1561
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,639
so you know you want to avoid any

1562
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,159
poisonous plants

1563
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,400
you don't want to use blackberry you

1564
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,159
know i mean uh poison oak better you

1565
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,960
feed that to your goat

1566
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:02,399
but um for the most part there are

1567
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,880
plants all around you

1568
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,160
that you can harvest on the sides of the

1569
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,440
roads

1570
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,799
in the forest i am just constantly

1571
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,960
amazed just

1572
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,318
i like to just you know at some point

1573
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,400
get present to where i'm standing

1574
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,079
outside and just start looking around

1575
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,760
for most of it sounds like the first

1576
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,160
place they should start is

1577
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,839
uh by making an inventory you know go

1578
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,159
walk their property

1579
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,199
at the beginning of april or even a

1580
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,598
little earlier

1581
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,639
if the if this if where you live the

1582
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,039
snow recedes

1583
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,920
uh sooner than that and then make an

1584
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,639
inventory and

1585
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,159
start by researching those plants

1586
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,759
because a lot of the plants that we

1587
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,279
think of as

1588
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,280
invasives like the blackberry or

1589
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,599
or some of the things that are just like

1590
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,319
uh you know a challenging plant that

1591
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,039
takes over

1592
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,318
like the horse tail you know whatever

1593
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:55,279
the plant is where

1594
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,960
you live that is spreading so much at

1595
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,319
the beginning of the season

1596
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,358
it is trying to express um you know

1597
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:05,838
abundant life energy in in for

1598
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:06,719
itself and that's those are the parts of

1599
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,639
the plant

1600
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:13,039
that we use for our various concoctions

1601
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,879
so i would you know you gave us examples

1602
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,800
based on where you live but it sounds

1603
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,838
like no matter where the person lives in

1604
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,079
the country

1605
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,920
first things first is to make a list of

1606
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,440
all the plants that you've got too much

1607
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,559
of in the spring

1608
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,358
so that you can strategize how to

1609
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,640
turn those into nutrients yeah you want

1610
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,759
to get to know your

1611
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,598
plant allies in your in your biome and i

1612
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,720
would recommend people get a book

1613
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,079
on edibles foraging wild edibles because

1614
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,000
a lot of these plants we think of as

1615
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,160
weeds are edible certain times of the

1616
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,760
year or in how you prepare them

1617
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,558
and i would also recommend people get a

1618
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,079
book on harvesting wild medicinals

1619
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,280
because a lot of these same plants have

1620
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,039
incredible medicinal and healing effects

1621
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,680
this st john's wort we harvested over

1622
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,119
the weekend i use it for pesticide but

1623
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,199
we're also harvesting it to make

1624
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,519
tinctures out of

1625
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,239
so yeah get to know the plants in your

1626
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,440
biome

1627
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:08,719
in your community in your neighborhood

1628
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,480
there might you know you might not have

1629
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:11,519
that much diversity on your property but

1630
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,039
i bet within a five

1631
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:17,039
mile radius there are lots of plants

1632
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,519
so get out there and and introduce

1633
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,759
yourself and get to know them

1634
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,599
so you know once we've identified these

1635
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,240
plants that are on our property

1636
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,240
in abundance um and we have

1637
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,838
sorry about that um once we have

1638
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,720
identified them

1639
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:38,159
and we have um you know we know what we

1640
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:40,399
want from them

1641
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,000
these nutrients are kind of like locked

1642
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,880
in there right

1643
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and i know that there are both aerated

1644
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,119
techniques

1645
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,239
to coax these uh nutrients out

1646
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,800
and there are also unaerated techniques

1647
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,239
um that can coax these out and as a

1648
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
matter of fact the first time i ever

1649
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,558
heard about

1650
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,920
natural farming was from a buddy of mine

1651
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,720
on the island i went over to his house

1652
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,240
and he had these

1653
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:06,480
these five five gallon buckets and

1654
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,759
they were all you know they all had

1655
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,920
subtle bubbles

1656
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,440
covering them as they were there in the

1657
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,920
hot sun

1658
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,880
and it just looked like sludgy to my

1659
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,280
inexperienced

1660
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,800
eyes you know here 10 years ago now and

1661
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,079
i'm all like you know like dude your

1662
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,400
bubbler's broken

1663
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,920
you know and and he's like he's like no

1664
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,358
man i know what i'm doing and i'm like

1665
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,800
all right and i just like moved on and

1666
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:28,480
it wasn't until a couple years later

1667
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,599
that i realized that not everything

1668
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,920
needs a bubbler

1669
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,280
but i gotta tell you um you know in my

1670
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,400
head they generally do

1671
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,760
so will you walk us through the

1672
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,800
different

1673
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,880
ways in which to bring the nutrition

1674
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,720
out of these plants so that we can use

1675
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,240
them sure

1676
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:49,118
well i prefer i tend to use anaerobic

1677
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,558
ferments

1678
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:55,039
these are your non-aerated ferments

1679
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,119
i like to use the microbes that are on

1680
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,239
the leaf mold in the forest to break

1681
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,079
down my plants

1682
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,439
to extract the nutrients to make them

1683
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,200
plant available

1684
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,280
and so i do this by going into the

1685
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:06,879
forest into the deep you know untouched

1686
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,559
areas of the forest

1687
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,200
and i go near the base of these big

1688
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,559
trees often hear it's oaks or madrones

1689
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,960
or dug fur

1690
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,119
and i peel back that top layer of leaf

1691
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,240
the undecomposed leaf from just the last

1692
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,000
season or two

1693
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,838
and you get down into that little lower

1694
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,639
layer of leaf that's starting to break

1695
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:24,960
down as it

1696
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,400
as it turns into the soil and you're

1697
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,559
going to see these white strands of

1698
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,920
mycelium looks like spiderwebs racing

1699
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,720
through that soil these are

1700
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,680
these are large networks of bacteria

1701
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,759
microbes

1702
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,759
that are breaking down that soil a lot

1703
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,119
of these are decomposers

1704
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,520
some are predators that eat the

1705
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,160
decomposers you know the soil food web

1706
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:47,358
is a whole

1707
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:49,118
there's a whole foods there's a whole uh

1708
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,078
there's a whole food chain taking place

1709
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,920
under that soil so when we harness the

1710
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,680
power of these microbes and gather them

1711
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,318
from the forest these are billions of

1712
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:58,000
workers

1713
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:59,838
you know in one gram of that leaf mold

1714
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,760
they're between two and 10 billion

1715
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,440
microbes

1716
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,440
we can harness their power and we can

1717
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,358
put them to work and when i heart when i

1718
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,599
harvest these from the forest from my

1719
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,279
from my farm here i know these are these

1720
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,798
are microbes that are strong they're

1721
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,640
powerful these are the indigenous

1722
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:17,358
microorganisms they're already thriving

1723
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:18,558
here at my elevation and my exposure and

1724
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,159
these are you know these are the good

1725
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,240
ones when you buy one when you buy a bag

1726
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,078
of mycorrhizae from the store

1727
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,679
we don't know if any of those uh strands

1728
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,280
are gonna survive here

1729
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,798
but we know that the ones we collect

1730
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,000
locally are already they're already

1731
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:31,199
putting in the work here these are the

1732
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,119
strong microbes so

1733
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,879
i like to use those microbes to break

1734
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,880
down my plant material

1735
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,640
meaning i put them put my plant material

1736
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,798
in a bucket with some water i throw a

1737
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,639
handful of that leaf mold in there

1738
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:43,838
and then those microbes go to work over

1739
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,920
the next couple of weeks

1740
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:47,519
breaking down that plant material i chop

1741
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,480
the plant material up into two to four

1742
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,480
inch pieces

1743
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,400
this just gives some more entry entry

1744
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,159
points for the microbes to go in and

1745
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,160
start breaking down that plant matter

1746
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,838
when we culture these teas these

1747
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:03,119
anaerobic teas

1748
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:05,119
um you know

1749
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,200
we're not aerating it we're not heating

1750
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,358
it these microbes are surviving and

1751
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,598
thriving at that ambient temperature

1752
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:12,798
when we make a compost tea and we aerate

1753
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,318
it and we heat it

1754
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,798
yeah we might be building a lot of

1755
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,798
biology but the minute that that

1756
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:20,000
temperature changes or those micro the

1757
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,039
bubble stops

1758
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,159
um that biology starts starts dying off

1759
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,400
quickly

1760
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,679
and so compost teas are cool they're

1761
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,920
great but it's a lot

1762
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,679
it's a lot of work it's a you have they

1763
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,880
have to be applied at the right time

1764
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:37,039
these anaerobic ferments just take a lot

1765
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,880
of the guesswork out it's very easy

1766
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,070
as long as you dilute them at least 30

1767
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,480
to 1 it's hard to go wrong

1768
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,640
[Music]

1769
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,000
you just kind of broke my brain joey i

1770
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,480
have always been

1771
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,239
a big fan of aerated tees because in my

1772
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,679
head they're like oh yeah we're super

1773
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:54,719
charging them

1774
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,798
with the oxygen and um you know that's

1775
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:57,679
so abundant of life and then i put it on

1776
00:56:56,798 --> 00:56:59,679
and everything

1777
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:02,399
but you know that's a really good point

1778
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:05,199
as soon as we take them from the bubbler

1779
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,680
and they're not being um you know in

1780
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,838
this

1781
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,598
highly oxygenated environment and

1782
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,960
they're in the soil

1783
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,760
suddenly we've got all of these

1784
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,039
oxygenated

1785
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:20,319
microbes that are in a much

1786
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,480
less oxygen environment of

1787
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:23,679
the soil i think i just tripped on a

1788
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,838
fight that i remember

1789
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,679
participating or watching about five

1790
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:29,679
years back online about this

1791
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,440
and i think it just i think i'm just

1792
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:32,399
understanding the nature of the fight

1793
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,559
now

1794
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,960
um what what

1795
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,000
so who are the guys who are who are

1796
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,679
these microbes that are

1797
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,039
in these these anaerobic um

1798
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,919
um you know fermentations uh will they

1799
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,159
survive

1800
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,400
more effectively than the aerated ones

1801
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,318
once they've been applied to the soil

1802
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,000
yeah these are the tough guys these are

1803
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:57,920
the tough guys from up on the hill

1804
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,119
they've been surviving up here for eons

1805
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,838
they're not they weren't made in a

1806
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,838
laboratory

1807
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,000
you know i always think about the um you

1808
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,639
know

1809
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,679
use the plants that are on your property

1810
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,679
because we always

1811
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,519
you know through through natural farming

1812
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,000
through k nf we're always talking about

1813
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,920
collecting and incubating imo right

1814
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,358
indigenous microorganisms

1815
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,280
that's like as far as i'm concerned

1816
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:22,159
that's the gold standard for natural

1817
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,319
farming is

1818
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,440
is collecting and incubating more of

1819
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:28,079
those

1820
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,079
and um because that we know that they

1821
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,119
know how to do the work where you live

1822
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,760
right

1823
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,960
and it just i apparently am not have not

1824
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,839
been using the same

1825
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,920
strategy in my compost tea because like

1826
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:41,199
i'm a huge fan of aerated compost teas

1827
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,000
and i'm not going to say that

1828
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:45,199
i'm going to stop using them but now

1829
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,318
you've made a case

1830
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:51,199
for anaerobic teas

1831
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:52,719
which is really hard to argue with um

1832
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,719
and like you said it's it's so much

1833
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:57,519
easier

1834
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:00,159
well something else we do to get the

1835
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:02,639
best of both worlds when i dilute that

1836
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:04,719
ferment into my dilution tank i diluted

1837
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,920
it 30 to 1 or 50 to 1 depending on what

1838
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:09,279
my input is

1839
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,440
i sometimes i will aerate it i will

1840
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,040
aerate between 1 to 8 hours

1841
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,280
and that will activate a lot of those

1842
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,880
microbes and now you're getting the best

1843
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,640
of both worlds

1844
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,559
so it usually just depends on what's my

1845
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:22,558
feeding schedule like do i have time to

1846
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:26,000
aerate this am i just trying to get this

1847
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,680
watered in and bounce um so yeah so with

1848
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,960
eight hours of aeration are you

1849
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,798
suggesting that

1850
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:36,798
the the eight hours of aeration is

1851
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:41,199
not enough to degrade

1852
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:45,199
the anaerobic microbes but it also

1853
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:46,000
uh excites the aerobic microbes and so

1854
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,798
then you've got a

1855
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,079
blend of aerobic and anaerobic or are

1856
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:53,358
you saying

1857
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:55,760
that adding some of the oxygen actually

1858
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:57,440
excites the anaerobics too

1859
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,440
yeah my understanding is it's going to

1860
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,838
excite those anaerobics and bring them

1861
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,838
to life

1862
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:07,838
right on all right so so um

1863
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,399
so we're taking these five gallon

1864
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,279
buckets and we're cutting our material

1865
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,318
down

1866
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,359
um and we're going to add you you said a

1867
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,400
handful

1868
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,639
of this forest duffman material that's

1869
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,160
rich with mycelium and has been breaking

1870
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:23,118
down stuff for the like the last couple

1871
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,598
years

1872
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,559
um since the product that we're going to

1873
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,880
be using out of this is the water

1874
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,319
the water component you know how much of

1875
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,880
it is really important

1876
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,400
so how much of the five gallon bucket

1877
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:40,240
would you fill up with

1878
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,639
um this found plant material these

1879
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:44,959
these new shoots these new greens these

1880
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:47,679
new tops of plants and trees

1881
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,440
and how am i you know leaving room for

1882
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:51,279
water to what degree like do we want to

1883
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,159
fill it all the way up with the plants

1884
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,079
or or or is that too much yeah with with

1885
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:58,159
your regular type of plant material

1886
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,318
i'd fill it at least halfway with plant

1887
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:02,078
material fold the rest of the container

1888
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:03,599
up with water

1889
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,280
certain plants if i know they're going

1890
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,599
to break down and turn into

1891
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,798
mush i fill the container all the way up

1892
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,720
with plant material

1893
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,559
one of the first one of the first liquid

1894
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:14,639
fertilizers i make in the early spring

1895
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,280
is from the grass that i mow in my

1896
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,558
garden

1897
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,240
i use a lawn mower with with a bag and i

1898
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,640
do it early in the morning so the grass

1899
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,558
is all wet it's covered in the microbes

1900
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:26,318
i bag that up and throw it in a 50

1901
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,200
gallon drum fill that thing all the way

1902
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:29,838
up with grass

1903
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,078
throw it fill it with water i add about

1904
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:33,920
a one gallon pot worth of this leaf mold

1905
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,000
that i collected in the forest

1906
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,599
and then over the first week that grass

1907
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,519
will be floating a little bit on the top

1908
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,920
so i will stir it a little bit over the

1909
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,480
first

1910
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,838
week usually after about a week it's all

1911
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,480
wet and mushy and started to

1912
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:48,159
disintegrate and starting to sink

1913
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,000
but if yeah if you make a ferment and

1914
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,920
everything's still floating just give

1915
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,960
just give it some good stirs that first

1916
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,358
week

1917
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,240
um if you're making these out of dry

1918
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:58,000
materials

1919
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:01,038
like we make we get we go to the ocean

1920
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
we gather muscle shells or oyster shells

1921
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,319
we'll crush those up for calcium if

1922
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,280
you're using dry powders or dry manures

1923
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:09,519
to make these

1924
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,160
you're going to want to use ten parts

1925
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:13,920
water to one part of that dry material

1926
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,759
so if i've got a five gallon bucket i'm

1927
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,559
only filling it up about a half gallons

1928
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,400
worth

1929
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,319
and then i'm filling the rest with water

1930
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,920
and i'm stirring that input over the

1931
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:23,519
first week or two just to make sure all

1932
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,838
the dry material is getting wet at the

1933
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:25,838
bottom

1934
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:32,318
all right so so if this process

1935
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,119
takes you know a week or so it sounds

1936
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:35,119
like your

1937
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,119
your grass experiment at the beginning

1938
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,480
of the season you actually even let

1939
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,039
sit longer than a week but if we're

1940
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,679
letting this stuff sit unaerated for a

1941
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,799
week

1942
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:46,960
especially the manure example um but but

1943
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:49,599
generally plants too

1944
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,400
the it starts doing its magic and you

1945
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,280
start to see

1946
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,920
the little bubbles on the top be and so

1947
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,960
you know that

1948
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,880
like the magic is happening um

1949
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,318
i normally think that i don't want to

1950
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,880
put that on my plants

1951
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,599
because the stuff smells rank often

1952
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,358
right

1953
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,359
um you know sometimes you'll get a plant

1954
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:09,119
like a lemon balm like particularly

1955
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:12,000
smells better than most but

1956
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,000
a lot of this stuff does not smell like

1957
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,960
pleasant you're taking a plant that is

1958
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,159
you know naturally bitter in many cases

1959
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,880
and then you're letting it

1960
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:21,279
degrade and to the point that it's you

1961
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,640
know

1962
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,280
giving off um gases and then you smell

1963
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:27,440
and you're like

1964
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,720
hell no i'm not putting this on my

1965
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,280
plants

1966
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:32,318
and it sounds like i you know that is

1967
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,039
that sounds like it's an

1968
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:37,279
old myth that i've got in my head and i

1969
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,680
need to let that go

1970
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,039
well yeah these are anaerobic ferments

1971
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,719
they are stinky

1972
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,079
and that is certainly a lot of people's

1973
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,679
criticism of them is

1974
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,119
ew they're gross they're yucky you get

1975
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:47,838
them on your hands and your shoes it

1976
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,200
does stink

1977
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,078
there's no there's no beating around

1978
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:54,000
that bush most of these ferments take at

1979
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,519
least 10 to 14 days

1980
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,679
for grass or purslane things like

1981
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,199
you know those oyster shells or um

1982
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:02,879
things like mistletoe might take

1983
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,639
three months or more to break down but

1984
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,838
yeah they are stinky the whole way

1985
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,078
through

1986
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,318
but i want you to think back think back

1987
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,000
through your ancestors to how we farmed

1988
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:13,920
for thousands of years

1989
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,199
you know humans were largely using our

1990
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:20,000
own manure for for farming practices and

1991
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:21,519
and not that long ago in in southeast

1992
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,480
asia and china

1993
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:25,038
they were there was a thriving humanure

1994
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,358
market

1995
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,200
and black market around manure because

1996
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:32,239
it was such a valuable source in

1997
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:34,798
agriculture they call it night water

1998
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:35,519
and they would actually build along the

1999
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,880
rural

2000
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:40,639
farming back roads in china manure human

2001
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,920
manure was such a valuable resource that

2002
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:44,000
they would build these

2003
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,920
beautiful outhouses on the side of the

2004
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,079
road and they would paint them and

2005
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,559
decorate them elaborately to try to get

2006
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,920
visit uh travelers to stop at their

2007
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,079
fancy outhouse

2008
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,119
to leave a deposit that you could use in

2009
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,160
your fields wow

2010
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,760
this is how valuable human manure was

2011
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,440
and so we have as humans we have

2012
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,960
completely removed ourselves from the

2013
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,318
loop we want to we what we all we talk

2014
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,720
about is closing the loop

2015
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,880
get back in the loop guys we take you

2016
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,558
know we take our our human waste and we

2017
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,880
put it in our clean drinking water and

2018
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:15,039
we turn it into a waste resource that

2019
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,798
you know this world spends billions of

2020
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,839
dollars trying to clean and

2021
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,920
and treat and um

2022
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:24,159
i would highly encourage everyone to get

2023
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,920
the book called the humanure handbook

2024
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,759
and really start thinking about how we

2025
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,000
deal with our waste streams

2026
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,039
and how we can work these waste streams

2027
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,239
back into

2028
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,000
our our systems you know human manure

2029
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:38,000
composted for two years is

2030
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,079
is perfectly safe i've put my hands

2031
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,838
right in it i've got a friend who won an

2032
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,519
emerald cup with some humanure grown

2033
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:44,798
cannabis he does not want people to know

2034
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:47,920
that

2035
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:50,480
but it's true so

2036
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,838
i make i use my own urine i've made a

2037
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,159
urine ferment

2038
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:55,759
uh basically you want to throw a couple

2039
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,558
inches of leaf mold in the bottom of a

2040
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,920
bucket

2041
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,359
and then fill that thing up over a

2042
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,720
couple of weeks i think it took me about

2043
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:01,759
two weeks to fill up a five gallon

2044
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,759
bucket

2045
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,200
and you let that sit for six months um

2046
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,440
and then you can dilute that at a

2047
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:12,719
hundred to one it's very potent

2048
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,720
high nitrogen fertilizer and now i have

2049
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,959
talked about closing the loop i am the

2050
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:16,959
loop

2051
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,880
and at a hundred to one that that you

2052
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,400
know you don't even have to go to a five

2053
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,920
gallon bucket you go half a

2054
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,240
five gallon bucket that's going to last

2055
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,639
you many many seasons

2056
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,000
and potentially your neighbors too if

2057
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,078
they're gonna touch the stuff

2058
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,480
i've got more than enough urine ferment

2059
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:37,440
to go around

2060
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,000
i'll send you a bottle so so let's

2061
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,599
compare

2062
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,719
that um let's let's talk with the

2063
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:45,119
aerated teas right so they're um

2064
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:45,759
even though you mostly use unaerated

2065
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,318
tees

2066
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,240
um because they are they are easy and

2067
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,079
quick to get to

2068
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,919
there are certainly people who are using

2069
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,318
aerated um

2070
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,960
uh compost teas and other things as well

2071
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:58,960
so

2072
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,960
let's go back to the example where you

2073
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,639
know a farmer's got their farm

2074
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,400
and they have done their spring

2075
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:06,558
inventory of plants

2076
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,519
and they're cutting off the the green

2077
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,680
bits

2078
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,119
and they are putting those in five

2079
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:13,919
gallon buckets or larger

2080
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,960
and they're gonna let them uh sit for

2081
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,079
you know

2082
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,559
one week to six months uh depending on

2083
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,079
what it

2084
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,960
is um but you know there's a there's

2085
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,920
probably a place

2086
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,519
on that same farm for aerated teas as

2087
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,798
well

2088
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:32,798
what can i use to decide which

2089
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:35,440
plant materials i want to aerate and

2090
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:38,719
which ones i i want to

2091
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,720
not aerate you know it's that's going to

2092
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:42,480
be up to your context i mean i've

2093
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:45,199
basically completely eliminated

2094
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,798
compost teas uh aerated compost teas

2095
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,879
from any farming i'm doing

2096
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:50,480
dude that's such heresy dude i can't

2097
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,720
believe i'm hearing you say that

2098
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,318
well you know you gotta look at where

2099
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:55,358
did these things come from who was

2100
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:56,719
pushing them you know

2101
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:58,558
around here was certainly the growth

2102
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:00,798
stores pushing them as a

2103
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,319
safer alternative to your salts but they

2104
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:03,920
really you know they wanted to sell you

2105
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:05,119
these big expensive multi-thousand

2106
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,119
dollar brewers

2107
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:08,559
and almost every farm i go to visit i

2108
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,760
see one collecting dust

2109
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,200
and next to the shed so you know

2110
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,039
farmers are only going to do things if

2111
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:16,798
they're easy we have to make farming

2112
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,000
accessible for everyone

2113
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:19,679
and that's what i really like about

2114
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,319
natural farming korean natural farming

2115
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,679
and jadam

2116
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:25,440
is it it takes away the uh

2117
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,239
it just makes it very simple you know

2118
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:31,278
the creator of of korean natural farming

2119
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:33,278
um dr han uh dr chohan q

2120
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,799
he wanted to give the power back to the

2121
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,560
farmer you know

2122
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:38,079
the the chemical companies the

2123
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,880
fertilizer companies they want they want

2124
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:40,719
you to think

2125
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,159
you have to go to the university you

2126
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,158
have to be well educated

2127
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,759
to understand soil science to understand

2128
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,519
what your plants want

2129
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,960
and that's just not true like i said our

2130
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,560
ancestors farmed for

2131
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,960
you know thousands of years without any

2132
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:56,159
of these things um

2133
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,600
if if we can just mimic how nature farms

2134
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:59,759
you ever see a compost tea getting

2135
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,719
aerated in nature

2136
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,279
i mean where would you see that i mean

2137
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,000
so

2138
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,600
i don't see where it's necessary and uh

2139
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,238
in my context these

2140
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,039
anaerobic tees just they make a lot more

2141
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:13,198
sense

2142
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,198
yes they're stinky and gross yes my

2143
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,119
hands literally stink right now because

2144
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,519
i applied some this morning

2145
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:21,119
but that's the life man stinky hand life

2146
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,400
stinky hand life

2147
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,838
so um with these different um

2148
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:28,238
with these different inputs you know

2149
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:31,198
there's a lot there's a big range

2150
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,639
in how long they will sit in the bucket

2151
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,479
right you've got you've got some of

2152
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,719
these that you said you know you

2153
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:38,000
just go a week and then there's some

2154
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,319
that have got like you know

2155
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,679
tougher skins and they take more time to

2156
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,560
pull out like the uh

2157
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,279
like the horse tail and then for more

2158
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,319
like like

2159
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,440
solid things like the um like the oyster

2160
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,000
shells and such

2161
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,319
you know you were saying six months um

2162
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,840
how does a person

2163
01:09:54,319 --> 01:10:01,198
know how long they should let this

2164
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:05,279
anaerobic tea sit before it's

2165
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:09,039
reached maximum quality um

2166
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:12,399
and is there is there ever a too long

2167
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,519
well first off let me uh let me make it

2168
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:15,359
clear by saying these

2169
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,199
anaerobic ferments that i'm describing

2170
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:19,198
right now are what we call jadom liquid

2171
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:20,960
fertilizers i would encourage everyone

2172
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:23,678
to get the jadom

2173
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,840
ultra low-cost organic agriculture book

2174
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,800
it was uh written by the son of of

2175
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,360
master cho

2176
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,119
created korean natural farming his son

2177
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:32,799
sang

2178
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:35,119
to make it so korean natural farming

2179
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,719
could be done on a larger scale

2180
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:39,198
and and that's how he was able to

2181
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:42,319
simplify everything using this leaf mold

2182
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:44,079
and water so some of the

2183
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:45,359
some of the things i love about making

2184
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:47,359
these ferments

2185
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:48,559
is they don't go bad they get better

2186
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:50,479
with age

2187
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,080
you never and you never have to empty

2188
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:54,000
the container out or clean it

2189
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:55,600
unlike a compost tea brewer anybody

2190
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,079
who's ever climbed in a compost tea

2191
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,600
brewer

2192
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:58,960
knows that nightmare that's what i'm

2193
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,840
doing when we're done with this

2194
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,960
interview brother

2195
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,319
i gotta do that today

2196
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,480
throw that thing in the put that thing

2197
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:09,759
on craigslist um

2198
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:11,279
so yeah uh

2199
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,199
i lost my train of thought i was

2200
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:15,920
thinking about oh i asked you how how

2201
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:16,639
how long do we let these and how do we

2202
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,079
know

2203
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,880
how long to let these anaerobic ferments

2204
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,920
sit

2205
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,440
so normally that liquid will get dark

2206
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,679
and i'm and i've got ferments that are a

2207
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,599
year old right now that are black

2208
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,760
that blackberry what i made that liquid

2209
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,520
is dark and they just get better with

2210
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,920
age the darker they get the better

2211
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,600
so yeah soft you know soft plants like

2212
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,399
the purslane the grass even the

2213
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,800
horsetail

2214
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:42,960
those are all ready to use in two weeks

2215
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,199
and so when i use up all that material

2216
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,119
all that liquid i never empty out the

2217
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:48,319
container i just fill it back up with

2218
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:49,920
more horsetail

2219
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,599
another handful of leaf mold and some

2220
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,359
water throw the lid on it leave it in

2221
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,520
the sun right in the middle of my garden

2222
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:57,359
you never clean out that material you

2223
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,360
just keep adding to it

2224
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,839
so that's one of the things i love about

2225
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:05,279
these jadom liquid fertilizers

2226
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,800
um and so yeah you know

2227
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,719
you're going to want to wait till the

2228
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,320
liquid gets really you know gets dark

2229
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,960
that's how you know it's ready

2230
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:14,319
soft soft stuff usually two weeks you

2231
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,079
know harder stuff

2232
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:19,359
up to three to three to six months some

2233
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:21,359
of the manures they say six months

2234
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,799
wow all right so is there is there such

2235
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,839
thing as a

2236
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,840
is a book that suggests um

2237
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,119
how long to let these things sit or is

2238
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,800
it really

2239
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:32,479
simply the darkness because that this

2240
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,279
seems too simple right

2241
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:36,559
um it seems like there has to be more

2242
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:37,920
than that

2243
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,080
well the big concern is that you're

2244
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,199
going to burn something and with these

2245
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:46,719
you always dilute them at least 20 to 30

2246
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:48,719
times so you know what the concern is

2247
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,319
you know maybe it wasn't as powerful it

2248
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,760
was as you hoped it would have been but

2249
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:53,119
you're not going to burn anything which

2250
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,640
is the biggest concern

2251
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,599
but i would recommend everybody do a

2252
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:00,000
test first water one little area foliar

2253
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:02,480
one little area don't do the whole thing

2254
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
start with ten percent of the crop don't

2255
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:05,039
don't hit me up later saying you killed

2256
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,479
everything

2257
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,039
hit me up later and say you killed 10

2258
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:09,039
percent here

2259
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:16,239
all right so so let's talk more about um

2260
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:19,279
uh indigenous microbes and so

2261
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:20,079
um you know if for most natural farming

2262
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,599
systems

2263
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:26,000
um you know your your local microbes

2264
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,840
that you were suggesting earlier like we

2265
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,399
know they can handle the heat we know

2266
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,239
they can handle the seasonal dryness

2267
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:34,479
we know that they know how to do the

2268
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:37,439
work here locally

2269
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,158
um you know for most of us collecting

2270
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:40,158
imo

2271
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:41,198
using the korean natural farming

2272
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:43,439
technique

2273
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:45,919
is the way that that you know is

2274
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,198
probably most popular

2275
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,000
it's one of the reasons why i tell

2276
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:52,319
people to use your local

2277
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,238
plants because they're already populated

2278
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:59,039
on the outside with your local microbes

2279
01:13:56,238 --> 01:13:59,359
do you have any other suggestions for

2280
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,880
for

2281
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:05,359
either uh collecting um imo

2282
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,039
to bring it to your property or ways to

2283
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:10,079
incubate them like we do

2284
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:11,039
in the imo stages of korean natural

2285
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:14,800
farming

2286
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:18,479
to you know give the indigenous micro

2287
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:21,679
organisms the the best step up we can

2288
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:22,799
yeah well in korean natural farming yes

2289
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:25,600
you've got this imo

2290
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,480
indigenous microorganism process uh

2291
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,440
about

2292
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,399
different steps you get two imo eight or

2293
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:32,960
nine but

2294
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,000
the most common are five steps uh the

2295
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,399
first being

2296
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,640
putting cooked grains cooked rice in a

2297
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:40,079
cedar box or in a bamboo basket out in

2298
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,880
the forest where these microbes are

2299
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:42,000
present

2300
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,679
and you're going to capture they're

2301
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,279
going to grow on that rice you're going

2302
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,000
to capture those microbes over about a

2303
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:48,639
week's time

2304
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,679
depending on the temperature it's a

2305
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,679
tricky process

2306
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,960
i probably had eight or nine failures

2307
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,000
before i started getting some good

2308
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,000
captures

2309
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,079
at my old farm uh there's a lot of

2310
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,198
wildlife and i had issues with animals

2311
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:01,760
getting into it

2312
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:02,719
get to eat the rice uh rain and getting

2313
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,640
it rained on

2314
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:07,039
i finally had a good capture when i put

2315
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,159
a i filled a wheelbarrow full of leaf

2316
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:10,079
mold and all this

2317
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:11,519
basically brought the forest to my back

2318
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:12,880
porch or my cabin

2319
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,080
and put the wheelbarrow right on the

2320
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,520
back porch or i knew the animals

2321
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:18,319
wouldn't come and i put my collection

2322
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,159
box right in that pile of leaf mold

2323
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,439
and was able to get a good collection

2324
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:24,000
right there

2325
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:25,359
so that's that's once you've got that

2326
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,520
collection of those indigenous

2327
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,119
microorganisms on that rice you mix it

2328
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,880
equal weights brown sugar

2329
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,238
and that just holds it in stasis you can

2330
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,560
store it long term

2331
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:36,479
now you've got your microbes your imo 2

2332
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,880
collection that's called

2333
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,599
and then the next the next steps three

2334
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,960
through nine

2335
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,000
are growing that on on on different

2336
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,560
types of medium

2337
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,198
we use rolled oats or crimped oats and

2338
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,960
bran

2339
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:55,119
and uh and wood chips um a

2340
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:57,439
25 oats 25 brand and about 50

2341
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:59,039
wood chips and then we make a solution

2342
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:01,439
using that imo

2343
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:02,800
for get you know some gallons of water

2344
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:07,519
some different inputs

2345
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:11,360
we use um uh humic acid we use uh

2346
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,800
we use um brown rice vinegar we use a

2347
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,880
little seawater which is high in

2348
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,039
minerals has 93 minerals

2349
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,719
and so then you wet this you wet those

2350
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:20,479
you wet that medium down and you can

2351
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,158
basically grow these microbes

2352
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:23,919
they'll inoculate it and grow it into a

2353
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:25,599
big pile over a week

2354
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,039
and then you can double the size of that

2355
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,840
pile by mixing it with

2356
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:30,960
uh soil from your land and it's a it's a

2357
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,880
long process

2358
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,158
it could take six seven eight weeks i've

2359
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,640
got an imo four

2360
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:38,238
pile and i'm a five pile going right now

2361
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:42,239
at different farms i'm

2362
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:43,919
i'm consulting on right now so

2363
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:46,319
in korean natural farming they say that

2364
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,239
imo process is eighty percent of korean

2365
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:48,559
natural farming it is the most important

2366
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:51,119
thing

2367
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,960
to have this biologically rich soil and

2368
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:53,519
and that once you get to that im04

2369
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,279
process

2370
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,960
you would basically put a light dusting

2371
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:58,479
of it on your soil that's how much you

2372
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,800
need to apply i'm not talking a quarter

2373
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:01,279
inch

2374
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,719
i'm not talking a 16 inch i'm talking a

2375
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:04,880
light dusting

2376
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,920
is enough to put this you know super

2377
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,400
powerful

2378
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,880
workers into your soil and when we have

2379
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:13,039
biologically rich soil microbial rich

2380
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,199
soil we're going to use less water

2381
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:16,880
we're going to use less fertilizer

2382
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:19,839
they've actually run tests where they

2383
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,760
found that these biologically rich soils

2384
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,440
if you've over fertilized them that your

2385
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,520
yields will actually go down

2386
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,039
so you might find that once your soil is

2387
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,920
biologically rich you can

2388
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:30,399
feed way less than you used to as well

2389
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,158
as

2390
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:36,960
water less so this is very important

2391
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:37,920
and as i mentioned before uh the creator

2392
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,920
of jadam

2393
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,520
master cho's son wanted to make this

2394
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,440
into an easier process that could be

2395
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,480
done on a larger scale

2396
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:48,559
so we have an input we call jms chadam

2397
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,559
microbial solution

2398
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,400
and instead of capturing these microbes

2399
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,520
on some rice over a week

2400
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:57,839
we can grow them in a bucket of water

2401
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,239
the microbes on a handful of leaf mold

2402
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,679
and we grow them on some smooshed up

2403
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:04,479
mashed potatoes

2404
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:05,920
we put a handful of boiled potatoes we

2405
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:07,678
mush them up into this water with a

2406
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,640
little bit of our leaf mold

2407
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,158
and over it can happen in two days in

2408
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,320
really hot conditions or

2409
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:15,920
over a week in cold conditions you're

2410
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:19,198
going to get microbial growth

2411
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:21,279
in this in this essentially um

2412
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:23,439
in the solution and so you're going to

2413
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:25,119
see this it's going to start making very

2414
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:26,639
tiny bubbles these are the microbes and

2415
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:28,800
it's going to turn into a foam

2416
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:31,360
on the top of that on the top of that

2417
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,440
bucket and when that foam is at its most

2418
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:34,799
vigorous peak that's when you've got the

2419
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:36,479
biggest growth you've got about a 12

2420
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,520
hour window to use this

2421
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:41,599
so you can either dilute it and and

2422
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,120
soil drench with it or foliar feed with

2423
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,520
it um

2424
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:48,158
or you can you can jump back into that

2425
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:51,360
imo process and for long term storage

2426
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:54,238
you can use that that jms solution as

2427
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:56,238
the input solution to make your imo 3.

2428
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:58,158
so you could take your bran and your

2429
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:59,839
oats and your wood chips

2430
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:01,839
and instead of making that liquid

2431
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,920
solution with the imo 2

2432
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,679
and all those other inputs you can just

2433
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,079
use your jms

2434
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,880
to inoculate that pile and kind of skip

2435
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:10,960
ahead of that

2436
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,279
imo 1 and 2 process that can be a little

2437
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,279
tricky

2438
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:21,359
so so through this during the second set

2439
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:24,719
we've essentially found

2440
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:28,000
two different ways to supercharge

2441
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:31,359
the property without spending money

2442
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,719
on on the store-bought stuff on one hand

2443
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:38,960
we want to um gather

2444
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:42,000
the plants that we know already

2445
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,119
succeed on our farm to the point of

2446
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,640
being a pest

2447
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:47,119
these plants and then also doing what we

2448
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,159
can

2449
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:54,319
to to capture and incubate

2450
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:56,000
our local organisms um

2451
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:58,079
so during the next set we're going to

2452
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,840
talk about you know keeping things away

2453
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:02,800
we're going to talk about

2454
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,719
pest discouragement but it really sounds

2455
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,920
like you know if taking these

2456
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:09,600
two um these two inputs

2457
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,000
the the plants that we find on the

2458
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,039
property and the microbes we find on the

2459
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,158
property

2460
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:19,279
all we're trying to do is to caretake

2461
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:22,000
the living things in our property and

2462
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:22,960
that we find the most beneficial and

2463
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,039
incubate them

2464
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,239
and help them along it actually makes it

2465
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:29,279
sound a lot more

2466
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:32,158
simple than most people think about

2467
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:34,000
fertilizer while it comes back to

2468
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:37,359
mimicking these systems that we see

2469
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,639
in nature you know microbes in the soil

2470
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:42,079
deep layers of mulch uh you know the

2471
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,560
these are just the patterns that we

2472
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:46,238
already see existing and thriving and

2473
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,080
and if you know why would we try to do

2474
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:50,479
anything else you know the more

2475
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:51,439
the more i get into natural farming the

2476
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:54,399
more i find

2477
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:54,638
that the the the core of natural farming

2478
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:57,439
is

2479
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,960
unlearning what i've already been taught

2480
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:00,479
yeah

2481
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,000
one thing i want to say i want to bounce

2482
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:02,479
back to the liquid fertilizers real

2483
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,279
quick

2484
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:06,399
um it's it's important that people think

2485
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:09,439
of uh

2486
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:12,158
of their plant as having three three

2487
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:14,158
three different stages of its life in

2488
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:15,920
korean natural farming in jadam

2489
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:18,158
we talk about the plant having three

2490
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,639
stages let's look at the cannabis plant

2491
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:21,759
we talk about its vegetative stage this

2492
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:24,159
is the the high

2493
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,960
you know vegetative growing early in the

2494
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:27,679
season

2495
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,198
we look at its transition phase this is

2496
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:31,600
when it's starting to flower

2497
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:33,359
or starting to fruit and then you've got

2498
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,719
your flowering and fruiting stage this

2499
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:36,719
is when it's budding it's fully

2500
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,880
fully budding so you've got these three

2501
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,520
stages and then we want to make these

2502
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,560
foods

2503
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:44,159
from plants during these stages to feed

2504
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,600
at those stages

2505
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:46,799
so let's just take that let's stick with

2506
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,000
that cannabis plant because i know

2507
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,119
that's what a lot of your listeners are

2508
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,760
growing

2509
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:53,279
we make our high nitrogen vegetative

2510
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,320
teas for our cannabis

2511
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:59,840
from our vegetative cannabis plants

2512
01:21:56,319 --> 01:22:02,000
will will you know excess plants

2513
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,880
or if you've got some males you want to

2514
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,880
kill

2515
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,960
or if you've got some plants where you

2516
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,239
need to clean out the inside of them i

2517
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,480
talked before about

2518
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:12,479
good air flow you want to cut out those

2519
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:13,359
inner shoots those little branches those

2520
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:16,399
leaves

2521
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:18,079
we use those those those green leafy

2522
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:19,839
shoots to make our high nitrogen

2523
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:21,519
vegetative teas

2524
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,360
and then when that plant's going into

2525
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,960
bud and you've got those tiny little

2526
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:26,559
buds on the inside of that plant in the

2527
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,399
bottom of those branches clean out those

2528
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,280
little buds once again improving that

2529
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,119
air flow

2530
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:32,719
getting the plant to focus its energy on

2531
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:33,198
the buds that are getting hit by the sun

2532
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,359
and going

2533
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:37,198
to get big and produce and now you've

2534
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:39,359
got a ferment that you can make

2535
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:41,279
into your transition tea and you're

2536
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:42,960
going to feed this during transition i

2537
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:44,639
grow some autoflowers here so i always

2538
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,439
make sure i harvest a few of those early

2539
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:47,199
in the year

2540
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:48,638
so that i'll have some transition teas

2541
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:50,879
before my full terms

2542
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,960
are going into that transition time

2543
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,119
usually here in humboldt that's around

2544
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,399
third week of july around july 20th

2545
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:59,279
we'll start feeding those

2546
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:00,799
transition teas and then you want to

2547
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:01,519
make your flower tea out of some ripe

2548
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,039
bud

2549
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,639
so same thing i'll use some of my

2550
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:05,359
autoflowers if i've got a messed up

2551
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,719
plant or two

2552
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:08,960
or something that doesn't look right

2553
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:12,719
i'll make my ferment out of that ripe

2554
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:15,840
terpe bud and feed that during flowering

2555
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,480
and so same thing we make these flower

2556
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,920
ferments

2557
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:20,079
out of plants that are high in

2558
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,639
phosphorus this could be your

2559
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:24,158
pumpkin this could be your zucchini you

2560
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,520
know those giant zucchinis you're always

2561
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:26,719
sneaking in your friend's car when they

2562
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,159
come over to your house

2563
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:29,600

01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,719
your ganja

2566
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,359
so yeah knowing those plants figuring

2567
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,279
out

2568
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:38,639
what their what nutrients they're high

2569
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:39,359
in what are their mineral mineral

2570
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:42,480
makeups

2571
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:44,158
and making those plants uh into ferments

2572
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,799
and feeding them to the plant at the

2573
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:49,198
correct time in its life cycle

2574
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,400

when cultivating cannabis

2587

regenerative cannabis consultant

01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:52,000
joey berger so during the last set we

2752
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,279
were talking

2753
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,399
about how to capture nutrition

2754
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:01,039
and beneficial microbes on our property

2755
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:02,719
um incubate them make them even more of

2756
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:05,679
themselves and then use them as

2757
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,719
fertilizers um thus causing our plants

2758
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,279
to thrive and

2759
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:09,920
saving a whole bunch of money we're

2760
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:12,639
gonna take

2761
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,520
let's take that same approach and talk

2762
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,319
about

2763
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,840
um pesticides and for the for the sake

2764
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:19,599
of this conversation

2765
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,960
we're gonna use the word pesticide for

2766
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,400
both things that

2767
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:26,000
may kill pests and probably more what

2768
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:26,960
we're going to talk about things that

2769
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,079
discourage

2770
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:32,000
pests so joey let's start us out with

2771
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:34,000
the kinds of plants we're looking for

2772
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,279
just like the kinds of plans that we're

2773
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,880
looking for when we're trying to

2774
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:38,639
wildcraft nutrition

2775
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,480
i'm just gonna guess that we're gonna be

2776
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:43,199
looking for whatever our

2777
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:45,039
local bitter and caustic plants are is

2778
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:48,559
that a good place to start

2779
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:50,399
yeah definitely um the best place to

2780
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,400
start is walking around your yard and

2781
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:53,279
looking at what plants don't have pests

2782
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:54,960
on them

2783
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:57,198
looking at what it's usually going to be

2784
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,279
your aromatic plants it's usually

2785
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:01,039
going to be plants that are high in

2786
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,319
essential oils and have

2787
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:05,119
you know thick herbal aromas you know

2788
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:08,719
like a ras

2789
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:12,479
like a rosemary or a lavender oregano

2790
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,480
these different types of herbs like that

2791
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:17,359
there's a there's a great book on jadom

2792
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:18,800
pesticides making natural pesticides

2793
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,839
called 100 plants for

2794
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:23,920
making pesticides i've i've

2795
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,520
identified over 21 of those plants just

2796
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,319
growing on this one piece of property

2797
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,920
here

2798
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:29,599
and i've been making pesticides out of

2799
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,440
many of those combining them and making

2800
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,039
them on their own

2801
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:35,359
some of these are good for soft bodies

2802
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:37,198
pests some of them are also good for

2803
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:39,359
uh for fighting fungal diseases like

2804
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:42,000
powdery mildew

2805
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:42,960
these jadom these dom herbal solutions

2806
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,039
as they're called

2807
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,639
are also beneficial they act as a

2808
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:48,880
beneficial foliar

2809
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:51,440
they're very safe you don't need to wear

2810
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:54,639
protective gear when you spray them

2811
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,439
and can be sprayed multiple times per

2812
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,960
day on

2813
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:58,719
a cool cloudy day you don't want to

2814
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,719
spray them in the sun

2815
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,239
but yeah once you realize there are

2816
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,119
plants all around you

2817
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:06,559
that can repel pests it's another it's

2818
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,719
another great tool to have

2819
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,920
in your toolbox but it it's not the

2820
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:11,359
silver bullet

2821
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,960
you're not going to just spray your way

2822
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,559
out of all your problems

2823
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,679
i'm going to talk again about diversity

2824
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,600
we're going to go back to that word

2825
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,679
diversity in your garden

2826
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,440
you know when you have a mono crop

2827
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,359
you've got sitting ducks there

2828
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:25,599
you know in nature it's part of the

2829
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:26,399
natural system for a plant to attract

2830
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,159
bugs

2831
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:29,839
this is how they help spread their seeds

2832
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:31,279
and how they propagate the bugs will

2833
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,119
either carry the seed

2834
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:34,800
or the bugs will attract birds that'll

2835
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:36,479
come in and eat the bug and eat the seed

2836
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,000
and they'll spread it in their manure

2837
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:39,439
so this is all part of nature we're

2838
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
working against nature when we're trying

2839
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:42,719
to keep

2840
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,479
pests away from our cash crop so it's

2841
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,760
it's a tough it's a tough order as

2842
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:48,000
everybody knows

2843
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,159
so when we mimic the systems we see in

2844
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,840
nature which means diversity

2845
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:53,679
you don't walk in the forest and see one

2846
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,719
plant planted in in

2847
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,880
plastic grow bags you see hundreds of

2848
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,279
plants growing together supporting each

2849
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,679
other

2850
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:03,359
growing side by side network of roots

2851
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,319
communicating with each other sharing

2852
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:08,719
nutrients

2853
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:10,479
warning each other of pests or other um

2854
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,679
pressures coming in you know they they

2855
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:13,359
communicate through through these

2856
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,880
mycelial networks i know you've had some

2857
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,119
incredible shows talking about this

2858
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,560
django i've really enjoyed them

2859
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:21,679
um so what that means is a diverse

2860
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,199
planting

2861
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:29,199
in your garden as many as many different

2862
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:32,158
types of plants trees perennials annuals

2863
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:34,000
vines berries as much diversity as

2864
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:35,599
possible there's seven layers of plants

2865
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,279
you've got your tubers

2866
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,880
you've got your low growing ground

2867
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:42,000
covers you've got your

2868
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,560
low herbs medium herbs you've got

2869
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,039
big fruit trees little fruit trees

2870
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,080
you've got

2871
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:50,079
vines they've got seven right there

2872
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:51,119
so you've got all these different tools

2873
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:52,960
there that are going to bring in

2874
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,439
diversity into your garden

2875
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,560
some of these plants are going to be uh

2876
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:58,238
food sources

2877
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:00,719
for predator bugs these are plants we

2878
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:02,479
call banker plants

2879
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,239
that are going to be food for the

2880
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:04,718
predators that come in and eat your

2881
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:06,000
pests

2882
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,520
you know when you release the predator

2883
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,880
bugs in your garden because you've got

2884
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,239
an outbreak and you you see

2885
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,920
you notice them for a day or two and

2886
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:13,198
then they all disappear well they ate

2887
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,639
your pests and there's no other food

2888
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:16,719
source and they left

2889
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:18,079
but if you can plant these other banker

2890
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,920
plants around your garden

2891
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,279
you're going to have food sources for

2892
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:24,960
these plants

2893
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:26,399
for these predators to stick around

2894
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,719
the other the other thing that goes hand

2895
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:30,399
in hand with that are trap plants

2896
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,079
these are plants that your pests are

2897
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:35,759
more attracted to than your

2898
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:37,600
um than your uh cash crop

2899
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:39,440
and so we like to plant these around the

2900
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,880
edge of our garden or at least eight to

2901
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:43,759
ten feet away from

2902
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:45,679
those uh those the cash crop this is

2903
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,320
going to draw the aphids and draw the

2904
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:49,600
mites and draw the cucumber beetles away

2905
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:50,960
so when you go out in the morning and

2906
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,400
you're doing your pest scouting you're

2907
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,840
going to check all those trap plants as

2908
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:55,359
well as the cash crop

2909
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,639
and you're going to monitor those levels

2910
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:58,158
and you're going to decide where that

2911
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:00,639
threshold is of treatment

2912
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:02,638
you know one cucumber beetle no big deal

2913
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,960
you know 50 cucumber beetles

2914
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:06,239
on my blue hubbard squash well now i'm

2915
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,439
going to spray that squash

2916
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:08,559
i'm not going to spray the cannabis

2917
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:09,919
cannabis doesn't have any cucumber

2918
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,760
beetles on it but i'm going to spray

2919
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,840
that trap plant

2920
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,280
and so yeah blue hubbard squash is a

2921
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,199
great plant that i really like to

2922
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:19,279
encourage people to grow

2923
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:20,960
it works as a great ground covers it

2924
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:21,519
works as a mulch it's providing a lot of

2925
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,840
shade

2926
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:26,080
it's providing a food source it's that

2927
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:29,440
trap plant for the cucumber beetles

2928
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:31,920
and any kind of squash bugs and you can

2929
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:34,319
make an amazing high phosphorus ferment

2930
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,920
out of that big old squash feed it to

2931
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:37,519
your ganja as well as feed it to your

2932
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:41,600
family all winter

2933
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:43,600
so really you know these pesticides

2934
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,880
they need to be part of a balanced

2935
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:48,320
program that includes

2936
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:51,118
diverse plantings of bankers

2937
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:52,880
trap plants other pollinators just

2938
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:54,479
diversity diversity diversity

2939
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,239
you know when you have a diverse system

2940
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:57,599
if one part of it fails

2941
01:35:56,238 --> 01:35:59,359
there's somebody else there to pick up

2942
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,760
the slack and keep it going

2943
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:02,559
diversity is strength this is probably

2944
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,920
one of the most

2945
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:08,800
pleasant solutions anybody's ever given

2946
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,319
a plant nerd right like you know we all

2947
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,159
love plants we're all bringing home

2948
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:14,319
plants all the time probably more

2949
01:36:12,158 --> 01:36:16,238
room than we have and our solution you

2950
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:16,639
know and the thing we hate is pests

2951
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:18,238
right

2952
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:20,560
and you're saying hey the solution to

2953
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:21,359
that man is more plants and i'm like

2954
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,760
hell yeah

2955
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:24,719
you know yeah you know any excuse to

2956
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,920
bring home more

2957
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:30,079
plants um i want to hit on

2958
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,039
um something you said earlier you said

2959
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:34,479
that uh these

2960
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:38,639
these um we don't want to spray

2961
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:41,118
these uh during the while there's sun

2962
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:41,920
and is there more to it than just we

2963
01:36:41,118 --> 01:36:45,118
don't want

2964
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:47,359
the water on the plants to burn because

2965
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:50,880
they act like little magnifiers

2966
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:54,238
or is there something about you know the

2967
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:57,039
you know the the the sprays from these

2968
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:58,238
high oil plants that we're talking about

2969
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:01,679
using as

2970
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:04,559
as pest discouragements that is also

2971
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:06,560
not to be sprayed during a sunny day it

2972
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,639
has to do with the

2973
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,400
efficacy of these being sprayed during

2974
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:12,880
high humid conditions

2975
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:14,799
in korea at the jadom farm they wake up

2976
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,639
between 4 30 and 5 30 in the morning

2977
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,679
just to foliar feed and to spray these

2978
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:19,679
pesticides

2979
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:22,000
this way the plant is covered in that

2980
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:23,840
solution that pesticide as long as

2981
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,399
possible before it evaporates this means

2982
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,520
your pests are coated with it

2983
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:29,198
there's a better chance you're going to

2984
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,679
have success this comes back to me

2985
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:32,319
saying

2986
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:33,440
you know when i teach people these these

2987
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:36,559
techniques

2988
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:37,519
if they don't follow them uh

2989
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,760
they're not going to have as good

2990
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:42,000
success it's hard to get some growers to

2991
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,679
wake up at between 4 30 and 5 30 in the

2992
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,118
morning to go spray their garden

2993
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,880
an outdoor grower you know we're here in

2994
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:48,799
humboldt county it's very dry

2995
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,159
it's not humid at all the only time it's

2996
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:53,279
humid here is at 4

2997
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:54,960
30 to 5 30 in the morning so if you

2998
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:56,319
if you really care about your garden and

2999
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,760
beating them back with these natural

3000
01:37:56,319 --> 01:37:59,279
processes you're going to get your butt

3001
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,920
up early and get out there and spray

3002
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,000
these

3003
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,279
while it's humid and if you gotta if

3004
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,920
you've got a cloudy day get out there

3005
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:07,519
and spray five times because you can

3006
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,800
we had a little uh heatwave here a

3007
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,119
couple weeks ago and i had a little

3008
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,119
aphid outbreak in my greenhouse

3009
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,639
we had three hot days up in the 90s it

3010
01:38:13,118 --> 01:38:16,158
was over 100 in my greenhouse

3011
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,760
and i had a life it outbreak and i got

3012
01:38:16,158 --> 01:38:20,479
to test out some of my pesticides i

3013
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:23,280
posted some instagram videos about it

3014
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:24,638
um yeah the pests are here we're gonna

3015
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:26,399
have to deal with them

3016
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,760
and if you've got a bunch of different

3017
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:30,319
tools in that toolbox

3018
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,520
you got a better chance of of getting

3019
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:34,000
getting a handle on them

3020
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,520
it's it's helpful to understand that the

3021
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,118
the reason

3022
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,880
uh that we don't want to spray it in the

3023
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:41,519
sun is because

3024
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,480
the water the solution evaporates so

3025
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,239
quickly

3026
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:45,919
um that makes a lot of sense to me and

3027
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:48,399
it's also interesting because you know

3028
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,158
we've all just lived through a year of

3029
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:52,319
uh coven stuff

3030
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:55,039
and so you know many of us have been

3031
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:57,759
using those uh hand sanitizers right

3032
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:58,719
and they say you know the the it's

3033
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:01,119
essentially just

3034
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:02,399
alcohol which is killing the the

3035
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:05,839
microbes

3036
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:08,960
and then a sauce that slows down

3037
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:11,920
how fast it dries

3038
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:14,000
because the we want it to stay moist on

3039
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:17,359
the hands because that means it's active

3040
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:20,479
similarly it sounds like we want these

3041
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:22,719
um you know we we want the

3042
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:24,879
the spray to stay as effective on the

3043
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:27,118
plant for as long as possible

3044
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,880
before that it goes heads and goes ahead

3045
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:30,559
and evaporates

3046
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,800
and then you double down on it right

3047
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,400
then you said eh you know on a cloudy

3048
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,920
day you might be able to apply

3049
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:37,198
it five times a day and when you said

3050
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,560
that earlier i'm like why would i want

3051
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:39,759
to do that does that mean this stuff

3052
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,119
doesn't work

3053
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:43,280
but i was approaching it wrong you're

3054
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:43,920
like i'm imagining you're going to say

3055
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:45,679
no

3056
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,440
it gives you if you can supply it five

3057
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:50,480
or six times a day

3058
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:54,319
you're spraying it letting it evaporate

3059
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:56,399
and it leaves some um helpful residue

3060
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:58,158
and it's still cloudy so you spray again

3061
01:39:56,399 --> 01:39:58,719
and now it's pushing the bugs back again

3062
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,158
so

3063
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:01,840
it's essentially like you're just

3064
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:03,839
hitting the bugs once

3065
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,239
versus hitting it five or six or times

3066
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,960
times a day and then you get the

3067
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:10,559
oil buildup on the plant so you know a

3068
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,239
cloudy day gives you a lot of

3069
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,800
opportunity

3070
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:17,279
to you know trick out your plant with

3071
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:19,520
all these defense mechanisms

3072
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:20,559
yeah and and i also mentioned earlier

3073
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,960
these are also

3074
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,600
beneficial foliar sprays so you're

3075
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,520
actually

3076
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:28,000
feeding your plant beneficials at the

3077
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,760
same time so spraying them five times in

3078
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,679
one day would only be beneficial for

3079
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:34,800
your plant

3080
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:36,880
are there any plants or or maybe like a

3081
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:39,760
variety of plants

3082
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,319
that we don't want to be spraying

3083
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,159
because

3084
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:43,599
it seems to be like from the last set

3085
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:44,879
you're all like yeah whatever you got on

3086
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,920
your property

3087
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:51,039
um except for probably poison oak um

3088
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,880
you know go ahead and and do an

3089
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:54,079
anaerobic ferment of that stuff and put

3090
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,719
it on your plants

3091
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:58,158
as long as it's the new season green

3092
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,600
stuff that's filled with

3093
01:40:58,158 --> 01:41:02,238
growing hormones you're probably going

3094
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,079
to be dialed and now here in the on

3095
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:05,519
on during third set you're all like hey

3096
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:08,158
man you know

3097
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,960
all of these these plants uh the the

3098
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:11,359
rosemary

3099
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:13,600
the the the you know oregano garlic

3100
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:15,359
things like that put those on it as well

3101
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,239
you're essentially just saying take all

3102
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:20,799
your plants and put it on your cannabis

3103
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:22,319
and it's it's just gonna suit them up

3104
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,840
that sounds like it might be overly

3105
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:24,799
simplified but it really does seem to be

3106
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,119
our point

3107
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:28,000
well that's somewhat simplifying it i

3108
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:30,880
mean i

3109
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,158
i do a lot of testing you know i i don't

3110
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,760
do anything willy-nilly

3111
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:35,279
if i'm messing with a new plant that's

3112
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:38,000
unproven to me i

3113
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,759
test it out i test it on one plant i i

3114
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,880
let it i feed a few one plant a few

3115
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,079
times with it before i would feed

3116
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:44,239
anything else

3117
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:46,158
so you know you can there's plenty of

3118
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:48,158
plants that are well known in our in our

3119
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:48,638
cannabis community as being beneficial

3120
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:51,039
and

3121
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:51,840
i would seek those out first before you

3122
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:54,880
start you know

3123
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:57,119
messing with any unknowns right on

3124
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:59,199
i guess my idea in approaching it like

3125
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:00,000
that was just simply people who don't

3126
01:41:59,198 --> 01:42:02,238
live on the west

3127
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,079
coast like you and i do and and they've

3128
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:06,319
got different plants than we do

3129
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:08,880
so i guess it would be you know do an

3130
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:11,519
inventory for your farm

3131
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,480
and then look them up and if you don't

3132
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,119
happen to have

3133
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:17,759
any plants that are you know

3134
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:19,759
historically used as fertilizers

3135
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,520
well then maybe maybe you want to plant

3136
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:23,760
it though i find it like

3137
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:26,239
mind-boggling that anyone would have to

3138
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,639
plant horsetail but it's because i lived

3139
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:28,718
on the

3140
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,239
west coast right and so horsetail has

3141
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,960
always been ubiquitous

3142
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,638
yeah well i'm on the east side of

3143
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,439
southern humboldt a little farther from

3144
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,880
the coast

3145
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:38,879
and we don't have a lot of it growing

3146
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,440
here we're pretty far inland we have it

3147
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,880
growing

3148
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:43,519
on one dam of a gray water pond that we

3149
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,520
have

3150
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:47,679
where it's really stays wet all year so

3151
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:49,760
we only have it in one site so

3152
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:51,199
um yeah i want to encourage people get

3153
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,079
get familiar with the plants in your

3154
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:53,519
area

3155
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:55,279
and you know a lot of what we're talking

3156
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:58,800
about here is very much

3157
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:59,118
uh you know not everybody has access to

3158
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,920
the

3159
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:03,279
to to land to plants a lot of people are

3160
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,880
in the cities a lot of people are in

3161
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:07,279
third world countries

3162
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,480
um you know we take a lot of this for

3163
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:10,479
granted that we have

3164
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:11,919
that we have these things i want to give

3165
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:13,839
a little pointer on how to make

3166
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,158
pesticide out of something that pretty

3167
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,159
much

3168
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:18,479
everybody in any third world country

3169
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:21,759
will be able to get and have access to

3170
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:23,439
in a pinch you know you can make

3171
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,880
these herbal solutions these pesticides

3172
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:26,960
out of tobacco

3173
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:29,920
if you only have access to cigarette

3174
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:32,000
butts you can make this pesticide

3175
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,920
i'm talking every third world country we

3176
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,560
know this this this tobacco thing has

3177
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:38,158
infiltrated every corner of the globe so

3178
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,600
you can make it out of collecting those

3179
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:42,158
cigarette butts

3180
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:44,000
boiling them for five hours and dilute

3181
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:45,839
that solution thirty to one and you've

3182
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,439
got a pesticide that you can use

3183
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:52,159
make anywhere in the world practically

3184
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:52,879
you know that was that was my very first

3185
01:43:52,158 --> 01:43:55,198
um

3186
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,920
introduction to anything natural in the

3187
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:57,279
garden

3188
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,920
when i was a kid you know i lived in

3189
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:01,679
detroit my dad um had a farm

3190
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,158
or not a farm he had a little garden

3191
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:07,600
plot in in the backyard

3192
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:10,960
and uh i remember my dad um

3193
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:14,079
i saw him peeing into a uh

3194
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:16,560
a mason jar and i'm like the hell dad

3195
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:18,319
you know and and and and he's like oh

3196
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,520
you know that tobacco i've been soaking

3197
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:21,840
i'm like yeah

3198
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,960
and because i remember he he bought

3199
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,400
tobacco i'm like what the hell you

3200
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:27,359
buying tobacco for

3201
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:28,719
and ends up that he was he he used this

3202
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:32,000
tobacco

3203
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:33,840
soaked added with the urine and then put

3204
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,920
it in a sprayer bottle and

3205
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:38,079
sprayed and and i you know i thought it

3206
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,800
was like some kind of bizarre sorcery

3207
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:40,639
right

3208
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:42,480
and it isn't until you mention it now

3209
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:44,319
that i'm like oh my god all about all

3210
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:45,759
the way back when i was a kid my dad was

3211
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:47,920
rocking this stuff you know

3212
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,760
as you know you know as as a total

3213
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:52,719
novice right might you know

3214
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:56,079
but but he was doing it you are second

3215
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:56,079
generation natural farmer

3216
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:01,118
that's great all right so so so once

3217
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,480
we've identified these plants we're

3218
01:45:01,118 --> 01:45:04,158
essentially going to give them the same

3219
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:05,759
anaerobic treatment that we talked about

3220
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:06,960
in the last set right that's essentially

3221
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,760
is that the same way that we're going to

3222
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,439
prepare these

3223
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,280
no no it's not we're going to make to

3224
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:12,799
make this pesticide what we call the

3225
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:16,079
jadam herbal solution

3226
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:18,400
it's even easier it's stupid easy you're

3227
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:20,319
gonna basically fill up a big pot

3228
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:21,839
or you can make this in your crock pot

3229
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:23,198
but if you're filling up a big pot fill

3230
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:24,000
it at least halfway up with plant

3231
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:25,519
material

3232
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,880
fill the rest up with water so the

3233
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,440
water's at least above the plant

3234
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,480
material

3235
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:30,158
i don't like to go all the way to the

3236
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:31,519
top because i don't want it to boil over

3237
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:32,799
but you put a lid on it

3238
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,719
this is going to help keep all the

3239
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,000
essential oils in it while it's while

3240
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:38,000
it's decocting

3241
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,359
and you're going to bring it to a boil

3242
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,118
and then once it's boiling you're going

3243
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:43,359
to turn it down to a simmer and let it

3244
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:45,679
simmer for at least five hours

3245
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:47,279
and when this is done you're gonna leave

3246
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,639
that lid on the whole time that's gonna

3247
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:50,719
help it from evaporating

3248
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:52,639
and it's gonna keep it from from those

3249
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:54,000
essential oils escaping it'll be more

3250
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,639
potent if you cook it with the

3251
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,158
with the lid on so then when it's uh

3252
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:00,159
when it's ready to jar up

3253
01:45:58,158 --> 01:46:01,439
you're basically going to take your jars

3254
01:46:00,158 --> 01:46:03,439
it's best to use plastic

3255
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:05,439
plastic heatproof bottles you're going

3256
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:06,079
to fill them up while the decoction is

3257
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:08,719
still hot

3258
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:10,238
off the stove put the cap on it and turn

3259
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:12,639
that bottle on its side and that's going

3260
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:14,399
to help sterilize the bottle

3261
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,920
and and you'll know if you had a failure

3262
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:17,519
in your sterilization because over the

3263
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,960
next few days that bottle will that

3264
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,400
plastic bottle will inflate

3265
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,079
like when you leave a plastic water

3266
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:23,118
bottle in the car and it heats up and it

3267
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:24,719
inflates

3268
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:27,039
that means there was some problem with

3269
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:29,198
the sterilization that batch went wrong

3270
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:31,519
those microbes are killing themselves

3271
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:33,279
throw that one out and try again

3272
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,880
but if this stuff survives if your

3273
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:36,800
bottle didn't inflate you've got a

3274
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,880
potent geodome solution there that you

3275
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,560
can dilute thirty to one

3276
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,480
you want to use it up within one to two

3277
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,000
days of opening that container it goes

3278
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,678
bad this is why i tend to make it in

3279
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,960
smaller containers that i know i'll use

3280
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:50,000
up in a day or two

3281
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:53,039
four ounces will make a gallon

3282
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,960
and yeah that's your dom herbal solution

3283
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:56,719
i make these out of single herbs but

3284
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:59,920
lately i've been starting to combine

3285
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:03,359
herbs i just made one that was a

3286
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:06,840
penny royal mint rosemary

3287
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:10,479
and oregano and i just made one that was

3288
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:12,560
wormwood st john's wort and the oleander

3289
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:14,158
you know the oleander is a plant that is

3290
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,920
used in landscaping

3291
01:47:14,158 --> 01:47:17,359
all over it's probably planted all over

3292
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,359
your nearest town

3293
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:21,679
it's toxic to people and animals but it

3294
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:23,920
makes a great pesticide you can use the

3295
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:25,199
leaves the stems the branches

3296
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:28,239
just wear gloves because you don't want

3297
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:29,759
to get that that liquid on any cuts and

3298
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:31,519
into your into your bloodstream it's

3299
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,360
very toxic but

3300
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,119
they'll mess those mess those plants uh

3301
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:36,880
mess those pests up bad

3302
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:38,719
let's uh let's let's go into that

3303
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,960
bottling step a little bit more

3304
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:42,560
so so all right so so let's say that i'm

3305
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:45,600
using rosemary

3306
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:48,000
and i have um you know broken up the

3307
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:50,000
rosemary and i put it in my pot and i'm

3308
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,158
leaving like an inch of a lip so i don't

3309
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,039
boil over and i'm putting the lid on so

3310
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:55,519
that i'm

3311
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:57,039
keeping as many of the essential you

3312
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,840
know terps and oils

3313
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:01,840
inside of it and it's still probably

3314
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:04,880
making my house smell hella good

3315
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:08,719
um so then when i'm done i'm

3316
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:12,159
um i'm i'm guessing that if i want

3317
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:14,560
the the the jar

3318
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:16,238
in my example i'm i'm i'm picturing

3319
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:18,239
using mason jars versus

3320
01:48:16,238 --> 01:48:19,519
uh the plastic bottles that you used in

3321
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:21,118
your example but

3322
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:22,800
i'm assuming that i would want to i

3323
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:26,639
would want to

3324
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:29,679
filter it to get out the the plant bits

3325
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,639
and then pour it into the mason jar

3326
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:34,560
while it's still

3327
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:37,760
hot and then put on the two-piece

3328
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:40,880
lid and as it cools

3329
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:43,760
it will create a vacuum and it will

3330
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:45,359
suck in my loose lid so that it's

3331
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:49,440
airtight

3332
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:49,920
um and i would think that that might

3333
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:53,279
make it

3334
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:55,118
shelf stable is that true yeah

3335
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:56,559
that's how i do mine i draw them up in

3336
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:57,599
glass jars because i don't want to buy

3337
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,000
plastic

3338
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,600
um and yeah if it goes bad that that

3339
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,560
lid's gonna pop up

3340
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:05,039
they'll store for up to a year at room

3341
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,679
temp

3342
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:09,198
cool dark room temp you can also keep

3343
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:12,158
them in the fridge

3344
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:13,919
but i just store mine at room temp and

3345
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:14,960
i'm using up pesticide i made last

3346
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:18,000
summer right now

3347
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:21,198
and they make great gifts oh yeah

3348
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,560
so so all right so so now that now that

3349
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:25,279
the the hot stuff is

3350
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:27,360
is in the mason jar and it cools down

3351
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:28,719
and we hear that magic little dink

3352
01:49:27,359 --> 01:49:30,559
from the other room and we're like hell

3353
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:32,000
yeah we win um

3354
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:35,840
i love that sound when we're cannon

3355
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,840
vegetables and um

3356
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:40,719
all that to get to this point here when

3357
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:42,000
we open it we break the seal i believe

3358
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:44,239
you said that we should use

3359
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,279
it within like a day or two and is that

3360
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:49,039
because it

3361
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:50,800
um all of the the subtlety is oxidizing

3362
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:52,719
and changing

3363
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,400
they say the microbes are eating

3364
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:55,599
themselves that they start attacking

3365
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:57,118
each other and i don't know if it's the

3366
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:58,400
microbes in the in the

3367
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:00,799
in the outer environment that are

3368
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:03,439
attacking the microbes in the in the um

3369
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,880
solution but that's that's what that's

3370
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:06,799
what they teach us in jadam

3371
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:08,400
is that you've got two days to use it up

3372
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,000
so this is why

3373
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:11,920
i know that on my farm i'm usually

3374
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,599
spraying in two gallon increments i've

3375
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:14,800
got one garden i'm spraying usually two

3376
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:15,679
gallons the other one i'm spraying two

3377
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,760
gallons so

3378
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,359
i like to make it in eight ounce bottles

3379
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,639
or 16 ounce bottles

3380
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:23,039
the eight ounces is gonna do my two

3381
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:24,000
gallons you know or i'll open a 16 ounce

3382
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:26,639
snowman i'm going to know and i'm going

3383
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,399
to use the other half the next day

3384
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:30,719
eight ounces and the two gallons that

3385
01:50:28,399 --> 01:50:33,759
sounds like it's a lot more of a ratio

3386
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:35,599
what are we spraying these at 30 to 1 is

3387
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,760
the dilution rate

3388
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,800
you can spray them more concentrated if

3389
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:41,280
you use a

3390
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,000
like a foam gun like you used to wash

3391
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:43,759
your car with

3392
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,118
that you can has a little reservoir to

3393
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:47,440
hold the um soap

3394
01:50:45,118 --> 01:50:49,118
yeah if you're using some kind of

3395
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:52,158
wetting agent and a gun like that you

3396
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:54,639
can spray them at 15 to 1 dilution rate

3397
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:56,238
and these herbal solutions work better

3398
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:58,079
with a wetting agent whether that's a

3399
01:50:56,238 --> 01:50:59,839
little bit of a dish soap an ounce per

3400
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:02,639
gallon of dish soap

3401
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,440
or dom has a wetting agent that they can

3402
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:04,880
that they um

3403
01:51:03,439 --> 01:51:08,079
that you can make it's just a little

3404
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:11,520
more uh a little more time consumptive

3405
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:12,319
um input to make actually let's go ahead

3406
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:14,960
and talk about that

3407
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:17,920
my buddy uh mindfully rooted down uh san

3408
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:20,560
diego i think he sent me a bottle of jws

3409
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,279
right jadon wedding solution and you

3410
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,599
know i

3411
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:25,118
i don't you know i was grateful for it

3412
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,920
because getting anything cool like this

3413
01:51:25,118 --> 01:51:28,639
is cool

3414
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,599
but i really only know one use for a

3415
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:32,159
wedding agent

3416
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,800
um you know essentially a surfactant

3417
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:35,279
right

3418
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,159
which as far as i understand i've only

3419
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:39,519
ever used

3420
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:42,479
surfactants which are are often soaps

3421
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:44,159
when i have got a pest issue i will

3422
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:46,319
spray

3423
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,519
you know whatever whatever solution i'm

3424
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:49,439
using for that

3425
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:51,360
mixed with a little bit of soap which

3426
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:54,638
helps it stick to the leaf

3427
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:56,399
as far as i understand um so

3428
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:58,480
so why don't you talk a little bit about

3429
01:51:56,399 --> 01:52:01,598
jadam wedding uh

3430
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:02,799
solution and and and maybe you know some

3431
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:06,400
other uses for

3432
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:08,719
it um other than the obvious sure

3433
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:10,879
well when we add a wetting agent to that

3434
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:13,679
pesticide it really helps it

3435
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:15,520
to stick to the pest it coats the pests

3436
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:16,399
they get caught up in these bubbles it

3437
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,360
just really

3438
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:20,319
coats the plant leaf surface so it gives

3439
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:23,519
a lot more

3440
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:26,079
efficacy to that spray how much

3441
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,719
how much if if we're doing 30 to one

3442
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:29,760
with these

3443
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:31,198
these pesticides how much of the jws do

3444
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:33,119
we want to add in there too

3445
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:34,479
probably an ounce a gallon i i think

3446
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:35,198
they call for about an ounce a gallon

3447
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:36,799
and um

3448
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:38,399
they're probably calling that jws

3449
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:39,599
because it's their own product but if

3450
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:42,000
it's if it's traditionally

3451
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,960
the jadam input we call it jadom wedding

3452
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,560
agent

3453
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:48,719
at jwa and the and the jwa on its own

3454
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:50,719
is a very powerful pesticide i would

3455
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:53,679
suggest you try using that

3456
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:55,279
as a standalone pesticide because i bet

3457
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,880
you'd be surprised at the results you

3458
01:52:55,279 --> 01:52:58,639
get

3459
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,118
you know they recommend using it on its

3460
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:03,039
own but also mixing it with any jadom

3461
01:53:01,118 --> 01:53:04,079
herbal solutions or other pesticides as

3462
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:05,519
a wedding agent

3463
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:07,039
all right i follow that and you know

3464
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,280
what it's entirely possible that he

3465
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:10,719
wrote jwa on it and now i'm just saying

3466
01:53:09,279 --> 01:53:12,158
it jws

3467
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:13,920
i don't want to i don't want to put that

3468
01:53:12,158 --> 01:53:15,598
on him so no no worries

3469
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,118
that's that's awesome he's making these

3470
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:20,400
inputs and providing them for people

3471
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:22,238
all right so um so we understand how

3472
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:24,079
what plants we want to source from our

3473
01:53:22,238 --> 01:53:25,519
farm we understand that we're going to

3474
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:27,118
boil them instead of just letting them

3475
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,960
sit outside in the sun

3476
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:30,799
we understand that we can bottle them up

3477
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,520
to use them ourselves and to give them

3478
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,039
as gifts

3479
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:38,480
that's all great as well um what

3480
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:40,399
besides sprays what other things can we

3481
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:43,359
do to discourage uh

3482
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:43,679
pests on the property for example um you

3483
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:46,399
said

3484
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:48,158
earlier we don't want to use the the

3485
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:49,118
weed whacker as much because it

3486
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:51,519
discourages

3487
01:53:49,118 --> 01:53:52,479
beetles right which are our allies are

3488
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:54,320
there um

3489
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:56,238
things that we can do on our property to

3490
01:53:54,319 --> 01:53:58,158
discourage pests that are

3491
01:53:56,238 --> 01:54:00,238
more physical like that that are not

3492
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:02,079
sprays

3493
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:03,439
well i want to bounce back really quick

3494
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:05,760
to the pesticides and just

3495
01:54:03,439 --> 01:54:08,000
mention one more thing there's a way to

3496
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:10,239
make these pesticides that's even easier

3497
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,679
and it works for the most aromatic of

3498
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:12,879
these herbs because sometimes when you

3499
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:14,239
boil them you'll lose some of the

3500
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,560
aromatic effects

3501
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:17,598
so plants like lavender and even the

3502
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,679
rosemary

3503
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:20,960
they recommend put that in a five gallon

3504
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:23,679
bucket cut it up

3505
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:25,118
fill it with water cover it with a lid

3506
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:27,118
no leaf mold like when we're making the

3507
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:29,519
fertilizer just water and plant material

3508
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:30,960
and let that sit for two to four weeks

3509
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:33,199
and then you and then that's your herbal

3510
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:36,399
solution it's essentially a cold

3511
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:37,839
uh cold extract and um same thing

3512
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:39,839
diluted at 30 to one

3513
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,279
so there are even easier ways to make

3514
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,880
this it's just a little more time

3515
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:43,759
consuming i just wanted to mention that

3516
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,880
before we moved on

3517
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:47,119
right now that's good and while i'm

3518
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:50,000
mentioning things before we moved on

3519
01:54:47,118 --> 01:54:52,960
uh my buddy johnny mindfully rooted he

3520
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,880
did it does say jwa

3521
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:57,118
i'm the one who added the s so i i don't

3522
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:59,520
want it they're jumping under the bus

3523
01:54:57,118 --> 01:55:01,198
good job johnny all right great so so

3524
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:03,520
easy is good so

3525
01:55:01,198 --> 01:55:04,799
um all right so so back to the other

3526
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,480
question which was

3527
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:09,119
are there any physical things that we

3528
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:10,399
can do uh to discourage pests on the

3529
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:12,158
property other than just

3530
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:14,158
uh spraying these these uh

3531
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:15,598
discouragements

3532
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:17,279
you know there's a lot of things we can

3533
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:19,679
do that are just gonna improve plant

3534
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:21,279
health and when you have a healthy plant

3535
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:22,800
it's not attracting pests

3536
01:55:21,279 --> 01:55:24,800
you know when the when that plant gets

3537
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:26,239
sick it starts fermenting and exuding

3538
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,880
these sugars that are going to attract

3539
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:28,718
pests

3540
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:30,480
so when you've got healthy plants

3541
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:31,118
they're they're not sending a message

3542
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:32,879
come

3543
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:34,639
come break me down i'm at the end of my

3544
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:37,440
life cycle i'm food i'm

3545
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:39,359
they're just doing their thing so i

3546
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:42,399
talked earlier about the wind breaks

3547
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:45,118
and identifying wind sectors and

3548
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:46,079
we're in some windy areas up here with

3549
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:47,279
uh with the

3550
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:48,800
can with a lot of these licensed

3551
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:50,639
cannabis farms they made a lot of these

3552
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:53,279
farmers move their grows

3553
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:55,118
away from the creeks and the riparian

3554
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:55,920
areas and the wet areas along the

3555
01:55:55,118 --> 01:55:57,279
streams

3556
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:59,520
which meant a lot of people had to get

3557
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:02,559
moved up onto ridge tops

3558
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:03,119
where there was no water no streams and

3559
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,039
this

3560
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:07,118
put a lot of people in some really windy

3561
01:56:05,039 --> 01:56:08,560
conditions that they were not used to

3562
01:56:07,118 --> 01:56:10,559
and when you have a plant that's just

3563
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:12,719
being wind whipped all day

3564
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:15,360
it's not transpiring it's not doing its

3565
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:17,279
normal functions

3566
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:18,479
it's not a healthy plant and it is going

3567
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:20,719
to be crying out

3568
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:21,919
for being put out of its misery

3569
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:23,840
basically

3570
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:25,599
so that's something i really encourage

3571
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,319
people is let's how do we cut down on

3572
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:28,079
the wind

3573
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:29,920
in your grow you want good air flow good

3574
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:31,679
airflow is very different than

3575
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,480
your grows on a ridge and it being

3576
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:37,520
pounded by wind all day

3577
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:40,000
so you know high winds it's bad for your

3578
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:42,159
soil it's drying out your soil

3579
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,560
i see a lot of people in plastic grow

3580
01:56:42,158 --> 01:56:44,879
bags and these fabric pots which you

3581
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:46,560
know

3582
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,960
soil temperatures reach up into the

3583
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:50,960
hundred and forties there's no biology

3584
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,960
living in your soil at that point

3585
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,800
your plant is just trying to survive

3586
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:56,480
it's not even growing

3587
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,760
a lot of people would do better around

3588
01:56:56,479 --> 01:56:58,319
here with a little shade in their

3589
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:00,079
gardens

3590
01:56:58,319 --> 01:57:01,359
with with some with some tree cover in

3591
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:03,118
their gardens or even

3592
01:57:01,359 --> 01:57:04,719
growing under some shade cloth to get

3593
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:05,679
these temperatures down a little bit

3594
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:07,920
because

3595
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:09,359
once your plants in in those temps it's

3596
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,840
just trying to survive it's no longer

3597
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:14,559
growing

3598
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:15,279
i remember i was up enjoying a tour up

3599
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:18,320
at a

3600
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:21,359
lady sativa over near benbow

3601
01:57:18,319 --> 01:57:24,079
and they find themselves on the top of a

3602
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:26,639
mountain ridge and i learned a lot about

3603
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:27,439
slowing down water leaving the property

3604
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:29,039
because of course

3605
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:30,559
they're at the top of a mountain so

3606
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:32,238
that's you know a huge problem

3607
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,880
there's all of their water wants to run

3608
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:35,678
downhill but also you're right the wind

3609
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,960
is just

3610
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:41,440
like ruthless up there and it's um

3611
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,760
you know the views are great but the the

3612
01:57:41,439 --> 01:57:45,678
the farming can be challenging

3613
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,760
and it comes back to your context if

3614
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:49,920
you're up on top of a windy ridge maybe

3615
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,960
throwing a bunch of greenhouses up isn't

3616
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,760
the best move

3617
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,118
you know maybe uh that you're gonna lose

3618
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:56,719
your covers every winter

3619
01:57:55,118 --> 01:57:58,799
you know isn't the best move you know

3620
01:57:56,719 --> 01:58:01,359
let's let's let's

3621
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:02,159
let's make uh structures that are site

3622
01:58:01,359 --> 01:58:03,839
appropriate

3623
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:05,598
and uh cultivation that's site

3624
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,440
appropriate

3625
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,039
actually in the site appropriate part

3626
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:11,678
when when we did and anybody who's

3627
01:58:09,039 --> 01:58:14,639
interested in this there's a there's a

3628
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:15,520
video i did um about this on the youtube

3629
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:17,199
channel but

3630
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:19,119
they one of the things they do get is a

3631
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:22,238
lot of hella hot sun

3632
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:25,279
and so they actually built this garden

3633
01:58:22,238 --> 01:58:27,279
that was all uh heavy rocks that they

3634
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:29,840
were pulling out of

3635
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:30,719
the other parts of the farm and they

3636
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:32,560
made like this

3637
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:35,840
uh you know more than a semi-circle

3638
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:36,800
let's say you know 280 degrees of a full

3639
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,239
circle

3640
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:42,159
and so during the day they were these

3641
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:43,839
these these rocks were getting really

3642
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:44,638
hot and so that's where they were

3643
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:47,599
growing their

3644
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:50,000
longest term sativas so that they could

3645
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:51,679
you know kind of use it as a heat sink

3646
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,118
probably not a heat sink but a heat

3647
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:54,880
gathering device

3648
01:58:53,118 --> 01:58:56,399
and so that these these particular

3649
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,400
sativa plants were

3650
01:58:56,399 --> 01:58:59,598
not being able to grow longer and i i

3651
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:03,279
think that's a really

3652
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:05,599
a novel use of you know building

3653
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:06,960
your growing space for your unique

3654
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:08,880
parcel

3655
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:10,960
yeah that comes back to that

3656
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:12,079
permaculture principle of capture and

3657
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:14,399
store energy

3658
01:59:12,079 --> 01:59:16,158
and i know rio the owner of lady sativa

3659
01:59:14,399 --> 01:59:17,679
farm i've spent a lot of time up there

3660
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:19,679
actually did their dragonfly earth

3661
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:20,239
medicine certification for their farm

3662
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:22,399
and

3663
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:24,238
i know rio is a long time permaculture

3664
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:25,598
practitioner so to yeah to hear that

3665
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:27,919
he's got design

3666
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:29,679
in there where he's capturing that heat

3667
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:31,359
and that sun that's hitting his property

3668
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:33,039
and it's not just hitting the dirt he's

3669
01:59:31,359 --> 01:59:34,799
capturing it in those rocks

3670
01:59:33,039 --> 01:59:36,319
so you can release that heat at night

3671
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,480
and on the cold days

3672
01:59:36,319 --> 01:59:39,840
i mean that is just you know capturing a

3673
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:40,399
resource that's already there it's

3674
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,159
genius

3675
01:59:40,399 --> 01:59:44,479
yeah totally shout out to rio that was a

3676
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:45,679
really great tour and um you know a lot

3677
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:47,198
of people just want to show you the

3678
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:49,760
flowers we're like ooh

3679
01:59:47,198 --> 01:59:50,559
you know weed's great it like i totally

3680
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:54,000
felt like i got

3681
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:56,159
a a um an education in water

3682
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,560
sequestration just hanging out with him

3683
01:59:56,158 --> 01:59:59,359
he's a he's a good teacher he he he gets

3684
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:02,159
it so

3685
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:04,479
absolutely all right so um uh let's

3686
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:05,118
let's hit on variety before we wrap this

3687
02:00:04,479 --> 02:00:07,039
party up

3688
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:09,039
so um you know when we were talking

3689
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:10,079
about the wild crafting nutrition you

3690
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:13,118
kept on bringing

3691
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:14,719
home the the variety of the nutrition

3692
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:16,238
and the variety of the plants we're

3693
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:18,880
going to be pulling from and

3694
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:20,399
you know we want to use the diversity on

3695
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:22,719
our farm to help us

3696
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:24,158
is this also the case when it comes to

3697
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:26,480
discouraging pests

3698
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:27,920
i'm assuming we want to put as many

3699
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:30,479
different types of

3700
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:31,679
fragrant oils on our plants as possible

3701
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:32,799
because there's that many different

3702
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:35,039
pests

3703
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,599
well yeah and and with the jadam herbal

3704
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:37,920
solutions it's recommended to alternate

3705
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:39,440
them

3706
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:41,279
as we've seen with these pests you've

3707
02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:42,799
got one product and you split spray it

3708
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:44,399
for a round or two you might be able to

3709
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:46,000
hold the pests off but by round three

3710
02:00:44,399 --> 02:00:47,279
they've built up resilience and we've

3711
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,719
seen this here in the emerald triangle

3712
02:00:47,279 --> 02:00:50,559
for decades where

3713
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:52,079
spider mites built up resistance and

3714
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:54,639
then you had the russet mites come along

3715
02:00:52,079 --> 02:00:57,039
and now you've got aphids and and these

3716
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:57,920
these these bugs know how to evolve

3717
02:00:57,039 --> 02:01:00,399
they're smart

3718
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:02,079
the hair they've been around a lot just

3719
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:03,598
as long as us if not longer

3720
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:05,118
and have survived through some pretty

3721
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:07,119
gnarly stuff so

3722
02:01:05,118 --> 02:01:09,598
yeah it's all about having as much

3723
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:11,439
diversity on that farm as possible

3724
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:12,960
and to hit them with as many different

3725
02:01:11,439 --> 02:01:14,799
tools as possible

3726
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,319
so i like to make sure i always have it

3727
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:18,960
at least three different

3728
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:19,920
herbal solutions made at all times that

3729
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:21,599
i can alternate

3730
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,039
on a cloudy day i'm spraying one in the

3731
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:24,480
morning i'm spraying a different one in

3732
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:26,079
the evening and the next morning i'm

3733
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:27,598
spraying that third one

3734
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:31,198
and i'm making sure that at least one of

3735
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:34,400
those is also good for powdery mildew

3736
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:36,238
so yeah diversity changing it up

3737
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:37,759
having lots of plants in there if you

3738
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:39,598
walked in my garden right now you'd see

3739
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:41,440
a lot of areas where i'm just letting

3740
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:42,800
all the weeds go to flower

3741
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:44,799
i'm letting all the thistles go to

3742
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,920
flower there's tons of stuff that most

3743
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,840
people would have just weed whipped i'm

3744
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:51,679
letting it all go to flower and i've got

3745
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,639
tons of pollinators just naturally doing

3746
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:55,279
their processes

3747
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:55,760
in my garden and i'm not dealing with

3748
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:58,000
any

3749
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,199
any unbalanced outbreaks because

3750
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,479
everything is just

3751
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:05,198
well balanced and it's really is really

3752
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:06,158
beautiful to see all of these you know

3753
02:02:05,198 --> 02:02:08,559
flowers

3754
02:02:06,158 --> 02:02:09,519
that would be you know invasives or

3755
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:11,119
pests or just

3756
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,280
annoying to people when you look at them

3757
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:15,759
as weeds but after you get over that

3758
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:18,238
emotionally it's really nice to see

3759
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:18,880
all of these you know even dandelions

3760
02:02:18,238 --> 02:02:20,559
you know are

3761
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:22,560
totally beautiful and like you know they

3762
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:25,679
they totally got they need better

3763
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:27,440
pr you know yeah so

3764
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:29,520
so let's let's end the show with this

3765
02:02:27,439 --> 02:02:30,238
you know um one of the reasons that i

3766
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:32,159
originally

3767
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:33,279
um started following you joey and really

3768
02:02:32,158 --> 02:02:36,479
enjoyed um

3769
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:37,920
you know your teaching online is that

3770
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:39,598
um you know i really think that you get

3771
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:41,920
the the heart of all of this

3772
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:43,199
right this this you know working within

3773
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:45,440
the system

3774
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:46,719
in ways that are beneficial to the

3775
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:49,118
system and

3776
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:50,800
to all the life forms that live in the

3777
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:53,920
biological system

3778
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:57,520
you know and and i like to at least

3779
02:02:53,920 --> 02:03:00,960
think that you know unless a

3780
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:02,880
parcel is particularly destroyed from

3781
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,599
like you know industrial presence or

3782
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:06,239
something

3783
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:08,239
i like the idea that that you know

3784
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:11,598
wherever the farmer's parcel

3785
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:13,598
is their unique holistic biome the

3786
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:16,159
wholeness of their biome

3787
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:16,639
has everything growing in it that could

3788
02:03:16,158 --> 02:03:19,759
bring

3789
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:22,400
their property back into balance and

3790
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,079
and dissuade the pests from the plants

3791
02:03:22,399 --> 02:03:26,638
that they don't want them on

3792
02:03:24,079 --> 02:03:27,519
to allow them to be on plants that they

3793
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:30,159
do want them

3794
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:32,080
on and um i'd just like to hear you

3795
02:03:30,158 --> 02:03:34,479
speak to that to the idea of the

3796
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:36,880
wholeness of a farmer's biome

3797
02:03:34,479 --> 02:03:38,879
to you know as much of that as that that

3798
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:41,679
you agree with

3799
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,880
yeah well it really just comes back to

3800
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:45,679
mimicking nature

3801
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:48,000
when we mimic what we see in nature uh

3802
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:49,199
we tap into that divine intelligence

3803
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,639
that has you know

3804
02:03:49,198 --> 02:03:54,960
just been been present for for for eons

3805
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:56,319
and uh when we work against that we're

3806
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,039
swimming upstream we're paddling

3807
02:03:56,319 --> 02:03:59,118
upstream

3808
02:03:57,039 --> 02:04:01,439
so if you want to make your garden

3809
02:03:59,118 --> 02:04:04,559
easier if you want to uh

3810
02:04:01,439 --> 02:04:06,000
harness the powers of nature you've got

3811
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:08,639
to build these systems that

3812
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,639
uh that that mimic those processes so i

3813
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:12,960
would just hope that

3814
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:15,039
people would take as much interest in

3815
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,319
these other plants these other allies as

3816
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:18,238
we do in cannabis

3817
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:19,840
i would hope that this cannabis would be

3818
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:21,678
the gateway drug into

3819
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:23,279
getting people to care more about their

3820
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,639
food and what they're putting in their

3821
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:28,319
bodies

3822
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:29,118
and and natural farming permaculture

3823
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:31,920
jadom

3824
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:34,399
k f these are all tools that can can

3825
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:37,118
help us get closer to nature

3826
02:04:34,399 --> 02:04:38,399
and yeah it's just been really exciting

3827
02:04:37,118 --> 02:04:40,960
to see

3828
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:42,799
this regenerative farming movement and

3829
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:44,960
the excitement in the industry and

3830
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:46,560
and for me to see these old-timers that

3831
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:48,239
have you know grown

3832
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:50,480
the way the grow store told them for a

3833
02:04:48,238 --> 02:04:52,158
long time to embrace this stuff

3834
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:54,479
and say oh man this is how we grew in

3835
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:56,000
the 70s before there was a growth store

3836
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:57,919
we would gather up leaves out of the

3837
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,719
woods and throw it mix it into our soil

3838
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:00,960
and

3839
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:03,439
those old hippies knew about that stuff

3840
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:06,000
and um

3841
02:05:03,439 --> 02:05:08,000
and when we start growing cannabis that

3842
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,158
the microbes came from my land and the

3843
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:12,000
plants that fed it came from my land and

3844
02:05:10,158 --> 02:05:13,198
the bugs that protected it came from my

3845
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,279
land i mean

3846
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:17,198
you want to talk about an appellation

3847
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:19,920
and a product that is unique to its

3848
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:21,359
uh to its origination to its source

3849
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:23,118
there's nothing more unique than that

3850
02:05:21,359 --> 02:05:25,920
product there's nobody else that can

3851
02:05:23,118 --> 02:05:28,238
reproduce that product that's unique to

3852
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:29,679
your biome to your property to your farm

3853
02:05:28,238 --> 02:05:31,439
your experience so

3854
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:33,118
i just want to encourage people to keep

3855
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:35,439
exploring that

3856
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:36,880
that relationship to the plant to nature

3857
02:05:35,439 --> 02:05:40,238
to all these plants and

3858
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:42,560
uh you know we have a biome

3859
02:05:40,238 --> 02:05:43,519
we are our own little planet our own

3860
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:45,199
little uh

3861
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:46,960
universe you know they're discovering

3862
02:05:45,198 --> 02:05:49,919
that these that these

3863
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,480
microbes are in between the spaces in

3864
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:53,039
between

3865
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:54,638
our dna in between our dna molecules so

3866
02:05:53,039 --> 02:05:58,238
we are actually more made up of

3867
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:59,920
microbes than we are of ourselves so

3868
02:05:58,238 --> 02:06:01,678
just as we have to take care of and

3869
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,078
treat those microbes in the soil and

3870
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:05,840
feed them healthy things and not poisons

3871
02:06:04,078 --> 02:06:07,920
we have to think of our bodies the same

3872
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:09,520
way and put healthy things into our

3873
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:11,679
bodies substances and food

3874
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:13,199
nutrient-dense foods

3875
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:15,440
because when these microbes are happy

3876
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:16,158
we're happy our soil is happy our plants

3877
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:17,919
are happy

3878
02:06:16,158 --> 02:06:19,519
when these microbes are unhappy because

3879
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:20,719
we're feeding them crap

3880
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:22,639
we're feeding our soil crap we're

3881
02:06:20,719 --> 02:06:23,279
feeding our bodies crap our mood turns

3882
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:25,920
to crap

3883
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:27,279
our health deteriorates the the the

3884
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:30,158
pests and the diseases

3885
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:31,439
and the parasites move in and they break

3886
02:06:30,158 --> 02:06:34,960
it down

3887
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:36,879
and so the sooner we realize we

3888
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:39,920
are the same as nature we are the same

3889
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:43,118
as as the soil and we're all one

3890
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:45,039
and we can start uh you know

3891
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:46,960
respecting our bodies respecting this

3892
02:06:45,039 --> 02:06:49,439
earth uh equally

3893
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:51,520
um i think we can get in tune with

3894
02:06:49,439 --> 02:06:52,719
nature and and be a lot happier and

3895
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:54,880
healthier and

3896
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:56,719
hopefully leave something behind for our

3897
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,800
children grandchildren and seven

3898
02:06:56,719 --> 02:07:01,520
generations that'll uh

3899
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:03,520
be a be a a beautiful place for them to

3900
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:06,239
