2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,400
one thing that the New Year means for

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,039
most of us is an opportunity to renew

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,039
and relaunch it's the time to make plans

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,399
real make smart decisions and reach for

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,039
things that may seem unattainable if

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:23,278
you've been wanting to try something new

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,679
in your cultivation recipe now might be

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,480
a great time to give it a try for those

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,960
of you following along on the shaping

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,159
fire Instagram account you know that I'm

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,878
experimenting with my first sea of green

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,359
style grow in a 4x4 tent in the shaping

14
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:41,039
fire offices now I got inspired watching

15
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:43,600
Caleb from CSI humble run sea of green

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,320
for many years and finally found the

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,079
time myself so far so great stop by the

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,600
shaping fire Instagram to check it out

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,600
for yourself while talking about

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,800
Instagram though I want to make sure

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,558
that you know how sketchy it has gotten

22
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,839
for cannabis businesses on Instagram if

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,558
you haven't already noticed Instagram is

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,198
intentionally pushing cannabis

25
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,319
businesses off the platform to support

26
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,519
their new Teen safety program up until

27
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,199
now cannabis accounts were primarily

28
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,359
flagged by folks in the community

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,960
reporting each other now though insta is

30
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,920
using keywords and image recognition to

31
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,319
automatically flag cannabis plants and

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,680
words like cannabis and cultivation and

33
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:28,438
clone causing creators to be

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,159
shadowbanned or deleted automatically

35
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:34,078
often with no way to appeal

36
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,399
Instagram very truly does not want us

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,199
there and yet Instagram is where we all

38
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,759
connect with each other as a Canabis

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,280
Community it doesn't seem right and it

40
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,359
is going to knock many cannabis

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,359
businesses and podcasts out of existence

42
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,078
there is talk of moving to Twitter or

43
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,799
blue sky or threads or Noster but none

44
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,559
of these have the participation of a

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,039
significant percentage of our cannabis

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,159
Community nothing beats Instagram in

47
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,239
that Guard we're all here when we all

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,439
leave Instagram the community will be

49
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,319
splintered as we go different places so

50
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,159
if you are interested in continuing to

51
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,359
follow your favorite cannabis content

52
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,159
creators or businesses be sure to

53
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,480
connect with them in a secondary way

54
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,280
that is more direct something like

55
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,840

the common errors that impact cannabis

it you know the biggest question

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,638
probably at the top is is why bother

00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,719
with green houses because we can talk a

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,120
lot about the details of green houses

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,520
but for many people they're like you

171
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,160
know I don't really want the money and

172
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,719
the expense I'm just fine growing

173
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,720
Outdoors it worked for me and it worked

174
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,639
for my py and like this is the way like

175
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,120
it goes and um you know when I used my

176
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,478
first Greenhouse I was really caught off

177
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,160
guard by how much better my plants

178
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,159
thrived so um you make this pitch to

179
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,120
people all the time about why they

180
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,960
should upgrade to a greenhouse so so why

181
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,439
don't you start us off with

182
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,399
that sure I mean you know most people

183
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,160
when they grow cannabis you know have

184
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,878
trouble especially in the fall you know

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,280
towards harvest season or harvest time

186
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,400
let's say you know the weather can start

187
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,799
to turn bad it starts to get colder it

188
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,120
starts to you know possibly even a rain

189
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,280
um and then you know throughout the

190
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,720
growing cycle depending on where you are

191
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,679
there can be a reason for green houses I

192
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,879
mean people in New York deal with rain

193
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,038
throughout the summer um you know we're

194
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,400
pretty lucky here in California through

195
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,478
a lot of the Cannabis growing where

196
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,239
Outdoors has been uh pretty pretty easy

197
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,158
for the most part except for you know

198
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,800
some of the years we've had some some

199
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:50,439
late or early rains that you know cause

200
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,038
problems but generally speaking um the

201
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,918
green houses provide a benefit of

202
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,560
protecting the plants it's a great way

203
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,799
to hide your plants if you don't want

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,000
the neighbors to see anything it also

205
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,918
provides a great great structure to be

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,560
able to pull a light dep cover over if

207
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,198
you want to do the light dep technique

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,680
as well so there's a bunch of reasons to

209
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,038
use a greenhouse for cannabis it can be

210
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,959
a little bit of a double-edged sword

211
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,839
using a greenhouse in the summertime but

212
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,158
as you noticed out on the islands where

213
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,878
you are in Washington it became a great

214
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:22,598
benefit rather than just going straight

215
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,720
Outdoors so um I think that you know

216
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,560
with cannabis being the Michael Jordan

217
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,360
or the super plant that it is compared

218
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,679
to all other plants um it just seems to

219
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,440
do really well in green houses I think

220
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,038
that's really well put it it really just

221
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,800
gives us options you know it it it gives

222
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:42,519
you an opportunity to um you know boost

223
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,240
your warmth if that's what you need to

224
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,039
cut down on your wind if that's what you

225
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,799
need to make it more discreet if that's

226
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,958
what you need it just it just makes

227
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,599
options and um and and really these

228
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,399
these kinds of green houses that we're

229
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,839
focusing on today you know you you you

230
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,278
you started in you know NorCal doing all

231
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,640
the all the gorilla and kind of like OG

232
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,078
hidden stuff and then grew into medical

233
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,679
and then now you're Consulting at least

234
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,239
all over the country if not all over the

235
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,399
world on these big you know

236
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,799
multi-million dollar shticks but but

237
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,679
what we're talking about today are these

238
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,639
these small $200 green houses which if

239
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,559
you get them on sale like this time of

240
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,600
year now like December for the following

241
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,479
year you can get things that'll be like

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,320
$350 in May for like 200 bucks and um

243
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,360
that that buys you a lot of options

244
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,680
comes the

245
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,240
summer for sure I mean my business and

246
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,078
previously when I was in you know

247
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,000
selling green houses I definitely was

248
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:39,078
shooting for the big stuff but we did

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,519
spend a lot of time and even when I

250
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:45,799
started out with the greenhouse company

251
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,959
um in 2006 and 7 uh we we were carrying

252
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,000
smaller green houses I mean granted they

253
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,518
were automated and expensive and way

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
more expensive than any would want to

255
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,519
spend even now um but we were really

256
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,200
hyperfocused on you know the home grower

257
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,480
and the medical grower and so we had a

258
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,600
10x10 and a 20 by 20 later on we created

259
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,440
a hoop house that was um 16 by 12 it so

260
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,959
it was still kind of big but at the same

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,640
time you know our our our thoughts were

262
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,838
always with the homeg grower um outside

263
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,799
of you know targeting the the commercial

264
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,640
Growers which was really you know what

265
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,879
the business had to do but um you know

266
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:25,480
the hom grower was really where where it

267
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:27,200
all starts and and um you know with the

268
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,839
medical side of things we had a lot of

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,959
hom Growers early in the day and then

270
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,160
with the new legalization in various

271
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:37,319
States you know hom growing is still

272
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,639
allowed in most cases and so it never

273
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,839
really went away but um you know I think

274
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,560
that it it's a great opportunity for

275
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,360
people to give it a try with you know

276
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,278
especially these more affordable options

277
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,759
that are out there now yeah absolutely

278
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:55,600
so so let's let's talk about um the

279
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:59,480
footprint so there are um you know you

280
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,680
can buy these green green houses U lots

281
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,480
of places um a lot of people buy them on

282
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,120
Amazon um but you can also buy them at

283
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,360
um you know different types of

284
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,360
agricultural stores if you're not not

285
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
into Amazon but I mean I have to mention

286
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,278
Amazon because so many people write to

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,000
me saying I just picked one up on Amazon

288
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,559
and right so I'm I'm guessing that if

289
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,078
90% of the people who are writing to me

290
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,359
asking questions about or buying them on

291
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,958
Amazon that that is is kind of the

292
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,639
default for most people um for better

293
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:35,439
for worse um uh I have bought maybe five

294
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,440
or six different brands on the website

295
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,880
um and and while um none of them are

296
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,320
particularly sponsoring shaping fire

297
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,360
right now um uh I just want to clue

298
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,560
folks in that I have liked the quick

299
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,039
tent brand qu UI c t NT for their new

300
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:56,879
upgraded stuff but but really I I have

301
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:58,719
not gotten a bad brand yet um so so you

302
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,399
know take a look and and and see which

303
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,680
ones on sale and which one looks good to

304
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,360
you but specifically let's talk about uh

305
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:10,439
Footprints Eric um the the the ones that

306
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:14,680
seem to be predominant are you know 15

307
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:18,680
by7 um uh 10x 10 20 by1 and there's a

308
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:20,120
lot of 25 by10 all of a sudden um um I'm

309
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,479
not sure why there's so many of the

310
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,078
different um sellers are using the same

311
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,399
footprint but it it wouldn't surprise me

312
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,759
if they were all buying their their

313
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,120
framework from the same company in China

314
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,519
and then they're all just you know

315
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,440
rebranding what they put on this

316
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,440
skeleton um what are your thoughts in

317
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,079
trying to you know figure out the size

318
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,160
that you want I it wouldn't surprise me

319
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,599
if most people just go for I'm going to

320
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:52,198
get the biggest um that I have got room

321
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,680
for in on my property right um but but

322
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:57,278
some people are like myself I needed to

323
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,879
make get one that I knew would be two

324
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,439
rows wide at least cuz I I I wanted to

325
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,559
be able to walk down the middle and and

326
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,279
have plants on either side when you were

327
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,638
selling these uh green houses not the

328
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,439
cheap ones I'm talking about what you

329
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,600
were selling was much nicer but it had a

330
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,240
similar footprint um what kind of um

331
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,839
guidance did you give people when they

332
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,120
were trying to determine what size they

333
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,800
wanted you know that's a great question

334
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,600
because everybody is a little different

335
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:28,719
than what they expect or what they want

336
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,519
and so with the green houses that I was

337
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,360
dealing with you know sometimes it came

338
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,000
down to price people had a budget and

339
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,480
this is all I could really spend so

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,440
we're going to okay we're going to get

341
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,759
what we can get out of this budget

342
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,480
basically um other times people just

343
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,480
felt like hey this is and and people

344
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,879
have a you know um a thought in their

345
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,120
minds I guess of what is safe to them

346
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,919
and what is not maybe or what is

347
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,480
reasonable let's say and what is maybe

348
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:56,000
out of reason to an extent and so you

349
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,920
know a lot of people would call with hey

350
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,639
this is the size that seems reasonable

351
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,958
to me and so a lot of times with the you

352
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,519
know they're not terribly bigger Hoops

353
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,278
than the ones you're talking about but

354
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,679
they are um bigger in width and height

355
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,240
and so the most common size Greenhouse

356
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:16,479
that we sold back then especially in the

357
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,198
early days was a 16x 48 or a 20x 48 and

358
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,519
I'm not 100% sure why but the majority

359
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,078
of customers that would call would

360
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,720
always stick with this 48t long

361
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,879
Greenhouse um and you know that wasn't

362
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,519
because that's the size of their

363
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,879
backyard that just seems to be the

364
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
reasonable size in everybody's Minds at

365
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,958
the time and so when you look at the

366
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,839
green houses that you're talking about

367
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,239
and the backyard setting or the homeg

368
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,320
grower setting it really comes down to

369
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,759
that like what fits in somebody's

370
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,959
backyard maybe without being too much of

371
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,919
an isore maybe it fits in the backyard

372
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,439
and it still leaves room for the animals

373
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:53,078
and the kids to play you know maybe it's

374
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,519
something that isn't going to look too

375
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,000
big to the neighbors and cause them to

376
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,320
call and complain or something like that

377
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,679
so I mean there's a a plenty of reasons

378
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,399
of you know why people pick these differ

379
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,239
Siz green houses and I think the one

380
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,278
that you picked or the company that

381
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,560
you're you know talking about has really

382
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:15,159
you know found um The Sweet Spot let's

383
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,838
say because a lot of the hobby green

384
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:19,278
houses that have been on the market and

385
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,560
currently on the market you know are

386
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,159
typically square or

387
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:27,119
rectangle um they're usually the clear

388
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,120
polycarbonate that um is you know

389
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
similar to Glass and it's transparent Y

390
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,720
and a lot of

391
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,278
them are kind of difficult to put

392
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,278
together some of them are fairly flimsy

393
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:40,318
in some regards and so it's really hard

394
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,799
to find the right hobby greenhouse and

395
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,759
that's why you haven't seen a lot of the

396
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,000
Hobbies be very popular um until this

397
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,000
one came along and so you know kind of

398
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,360
like you're saying there's been a a lot

399
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,519
of people liking and buying this

400
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,318
greenhouse off of Amazon or similar to

401
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,519
it and it's just because it seems to fit

402
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:01,759
that reasonable aspect of shipping

403
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,600
putting together longevity and then you

404
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,079
know the sizes they have seem to be

405
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,399
reasonable with where people want to

406
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:13,318
stick those in the backyard or at the

407
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:16,240
home grow yeah all all true and um four

408
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:18,278
years five years ago now there was a big

409
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,959
upgrade in the industry they used to be

410
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,480
all that like really cheap kind of like

411
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:26,039
white really bendy aluminum kind of

412
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,079
metal that like you get one bad storm

413
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,198
and they would mess up and then all of a

414
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,758
sudden at once all of the companies

415
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:35,559
tended to said upgraded and they all

416
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,318
moved to galvanized steel and um that

417
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,198
seems to be when they took off cuz

418
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,519
suddenly they were they were one step

419
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,399
closer to kind of like the adult green

420
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,198
houses that you're that you're more

421
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,078
familiar with right like suddenly

422
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,198
they're like oh if you get a little bit

423
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:51,638
if you get a little bit of weather

424
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:54,278
you're going to be okay and um and so

425
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,318
people started going with them um well I

426
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:58,078
I think that's really important to note

427
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:59,759
because a lot of the green houses and

428
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,719
even the greenhouse that I've put

429
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,399
together over the years that are you

430
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,919
know a little bit more you know a little

431
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,519
bit more commercial grade I guess you

432
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,199
could say I don't know but it doesn't

433
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,439
take much for a wind to pick up a

434
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,199
greenhouse and move it whether it's the

435
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,319
hobby ones or even the bigger uh more

436
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,720
commercial ones and so weather and and

437
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:22,519
you know wind and things can really put

438
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,919
a hammering on a greenhouse and so I

439
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,400
think with the amount of little you know

440
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,640
green houses like yours that took sale

441
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,720
in a windstorm and blew off the property

442
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,160
or maybe got damaged from some severe

443
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,120
rains you know was enough you know

444
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,640
complaints or notes to the company for

445
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,159
them to go oh you know here's what we

446
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,160
need to do and then they made that

447
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,120
change but I think

448
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,360
collectively um you know they had to

449
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,119
have enough people complain or have

450
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,558
problems with them for them to see that

451
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:57,079
change needed um but it doesn't take

452
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,519
much I mean honestly um you know I think

453
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:00,279
sometimes you can see the writing on the

454
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,200
wall and people just want to try out the

455
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,798
flimsy stuff first and see how far it

456
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,759
gets them let's talk about height some

457
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,480
because um most of these these um

458
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:14,200
consumer backyard green houses top out

459
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,159
at 6.6 feet and of course this does not

460
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,279
set one up for Monster California's

461
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:25,000
outdoor sized plants um and so we have

462
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:28,279
to you know be aware of that and um

463
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,720
probably um you know topping your plants

464
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,599
at least once and and getting you know

465
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,759
getting good at that but um it's

466
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,519
frustrating because with these these

467
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,558
hobby green houses um they have the um

468
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,480
they have

469
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:46,839
the what's the word like the curved roof

470
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,679
right and so you really only get the 6.6

471
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:53,678
Apex at the middle of the roof and so if

472
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,159
you put your walking space along the

473
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,919
middle you've got the head space but

474
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:01,799
then your plants are going to be topping

475
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,240
out at like six or 5 and 1/2 ft and so

476
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,918
so there's an argument you be made to

477
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,599
like put the plants in the middle and

478
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,440
walk yourself around the side but then

479
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,599
when you're in the middle it makes it

480
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
when they're in the middle it makes it

481
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,519
harder to tend to every side of the

482
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,760
plant because you've got them doubled up

483
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:21,279
in the middle um what kind of um you

484
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:23,798
know uh advice or thoughts might you

485
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,839
have about you know an abbreviated

486
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:29,079
height Greenhouse that cuts off at 66

487
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,798
versus to you know somebody who's got a

488
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:32,038
commercial greenhouse and they can go as

489
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,798
as tall as they

490
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,359
want well I mean I think that we need to

491
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,400
look at it as you know there could be

492
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,240
worse problems in the world than too big

493
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,038
of plants and not being able to get

494
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,679
around sometimes and so I would say that

495
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,558
maybe that could be a good thing even

496
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,159
though can be tedious and a little bit

497
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:52,839
annoying or whatever like I mean um but

498
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,240
to your point you know I always advocate

499
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:57,759
of trying to put plants in the middle or

500
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,200
to towards the center if we can you know

501
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,798
when you when you look at winter time

502
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
growing and I know we're kind of focused

503
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,359
more on the summertime but there is the

504
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,679
season extension and things like that

505
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:08,199
when you start to have your plants

506
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,640
closer to the walls of the greenhouse

507
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,038
they are closer to the cold basically

508
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,960
and so being away from the walls gives

509
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,519
you a chance to keep things warmer for

510
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,159
free basically but um at the end of the

511
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,158
day I think like what you're talking

512
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,679
about topping and training is really

513
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,559
important unfortunately a lot of States

514
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,679
you know and if I talk about California

515
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,720
in particular the hom Growers are only

516
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,519
allowed to grow six plants legally and

517
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,240
so of course you want those six plants

518
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,759
to be as big as possible but you know if

519
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,519
you really dig dig in or look back and

520
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:44,798
maybe there's nothing to look back at um

521
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,679
literature wise or podcast wise but when

522
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,240
I look back or think back I start to

523
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,880
think about some of the growers in

524
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,880
between you know really before the 215

525
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,559
days and into the 215 days there was

526
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,280
some Growers up in the Humble County um

527
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,599
a friend of mine Joey Burger the humbal

528
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,519
local one of the unique things what they

529
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,678
used to do is they used to start their

530
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,279
plants outside you know and this could

531
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,440
be done in a greenhouse too but they

532
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,918
would actually lay chicken wire on the

533
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,120
ground over these plants and I mean they

534
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,799
could grow a six PB plant and it would

535
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,239
never be taller than 3 feet just because

536
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:21,960
of the way that they trellised it down

537
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,480
with this chicken wire and did this

538
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,319
crazy ground technique and so there's

539
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,798
only a few people I've heard over the

540
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,558
years that are recognized that method or

541
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,359
seen it or heard about it or anything

542
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,359
like that um but it's amazing what you

543
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,079
can do with some of these plants I mean

544
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,439
some people have seen how there's

545
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,558
Growers and you know artists that'll do

546
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,480
bonsai to these plants and these crazy

547
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:46,278
root systems that come out of these nice

548
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,798
um features that they create with the

549
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,640
pots and and the bedding but you know

550
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,679
the cannabis plant can do incredible

551
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,600
things and so it's surprising of how

552
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,000
much trellising and bending and keeping

553
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:00,678
a plant spread out low to the ground um

554
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,119
that's possible POS so I would say that

555
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,798
you know on the on the easy side yeah

556
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,599
topping them um but secondly you know

557
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,480
how far can you spread your plants and

558
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,959
how much can you bend them and bring

559
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,679
them around and it does take a lot of I

560
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,120
wouldn't say a lot of but it takes some

561
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,640
extra work and and tending to to do some

562
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,038
of this stuff but it isn't out of the

563
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,320
question to be able to train your plants

564
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:28,079
to grow low and still stack on uh good

565
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,798
weight I know from when you've been on

566
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,720
shaping fire before and we've talked

567
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:35,918
about large scale green houses that you

568
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,000
put a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears into

569
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,880
studying the placement of big green

570
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,400
houses on the property and studying

571
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,919
microclimates and then um you know

572
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,240
lovingly encouraging the owners to put

573
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,278
the greenhouse the smart place instead

574
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,159
of necessarily the convenient place and

575
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:57,359
um you know when it comes to Backyard

576
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,919
green houses I would say the same is

577
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,278
true

578
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,840
and yet you have even more pressure like

579
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:04,599
oh but that's where the garage goes or

580
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,119
oh that's where the dog run is or oh

581
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,119
that's where the that's where every

582
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,918
summer we put up the pool or you know

583
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:15,759
whatever um there are lots of Demands on

584
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:18,240
you know somebody's backyard now

585
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,119
assuming that they have options instead

586
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,720
of just it's the only place in the yard

587
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:26,918
for it um can you give us some like um

588
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,519
you know thumbnail suggestions from

589
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,840
where we might want to place the

590
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,960
greenhouse on the

591
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,558
property sure I mean you know back in

592
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,360
the day one of the things that we'd look

593
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:40,359
to is that you know when whenever people

594
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,439
call for and and and this technolog is

595
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:45,918
changing over time I think there's apps

596
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,840
and more things now on our phones to to

597
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,520
sort this stuff out than ever but you

598
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,119
know originally when a solar person

599
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,918
would come out to give you an estimate

600
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,479
for solar on your house they would have

601
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,200
this device handheld device that would

602
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,159
basically tell them where the sun was

603
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,440
and the Shadows are for the 12 hours of

604
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,640
the day and so they would come out with

605
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,558
this handheld device stand in a few

606
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,919
spots and look and see where the

607
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,480
trajectory of the sun and the shade is

608
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,400
going to be and they would say ah this

609
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,519
is the sunniest spot on your property

610
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,038
this is where you want your solar panels

611
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,918
so we kind of started adopting that same

612
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,278
idea with you know where do I put my

613
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:22,880
Greenhouse we want to put it in the

614
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:26,119
sunniest spot possible and so we would

615
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,840
use you know some of the same techniques

616
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,278
um now you know like I said with the

617
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,918
apps and

618
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:36,679
and um other things that we might use as

619
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,000
far as instruments or tools we can still

620
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,640
do the same thing and maybe do it a

621
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,119
little bit more affordable or a little

622
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,880
easier uh but I would say that one of

623
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,558
the things that I like to look to is

624
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,480
that to make sure that the fall Sun or

625
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:54,759
the the late Summer Sun um is really

626
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,960
Intense or um really good so what I mean

627
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:01,759
by that is that you know I I I lived in

628
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,120
uh 5 Acres of pasture land you know for

629
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,038
20 years and so Sun really wasn't that

630
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,439
big of a problem but recently I moved 20

631
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,879
minutes up the road and I'm in the

632
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,840
forest and it's literally barely get it

633
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,840
gets any sun here and so it's not the

634
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,079
great greatest place for growing

635
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:19,119
cannabis but I did find a really sunny

636
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:20,960
spot and I thought I'd give it a whirl

637
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,759
this year and put out just three plants

638
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,079
I didn't even use a greenhouse because I

639
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:27,759
just wanted to test out this new spot

640
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,759
after we cleared some trees and so while

641
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,480
the spot was really sunny throughout the

642
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,599
summer and the plants grew fairly tall

643
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,880
as we started getting into the fall the

644
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:40,480
sun started changing um and basically I

645
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,679
got a lot of shade when I needed a lot

646
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
of sun for the ripening and the flow

647
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,278
production and so that's where it

648
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,919
suffered the most and I would say that

649
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,798
you know a lot of plants will veg and

650
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,679
grow pretty well even in a little bit of

651
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:56,119
shade or some shade in the afternoon

652
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,000
mixed shade let's say uh but when you

653
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:59,839
start to have the seasons change and

654
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,798
that's Sun becomes diminished during the

655
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,480
flowering time that's where you're going

656
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,639
to be the most bummed and so I wouldn't

657
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,679
I I would what I would recommend is

658
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,720
trying to make sure that that Sunny Spot

659
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,840
you pick is sunny all the way through

660
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,519
the finish and so if you happen to be in

661
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,599
the forest and you say oh this is a

662
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,440
Sunny Spot that might be true but is it

663
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,519
going to stay sunny the entire time and

664
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,600
if it's not I would find a place or cut

665
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:27,000
a tree or do something to make sure that

666
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,759
you get that late uh Summer Sun for the

667
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,839
flower development and the rening that

668
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,278
is so true especially if you live a

669
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,398
place that isn't as gifted with uh

670
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:40,038
cultivation weather as California right

671
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:43,959
like up here in Washington my uh my son

672
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:47,158
disappears um there in September and so

673
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,960
um um my first couple years here I was

674
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,480
positioned where the sun was in July

675
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,600
because I was all excited to bring the

676
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,839
plants Outdoors um but by um by you know

677
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:00,199
third week of September it it was

678
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,879
cutting across the sky differently and

679
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,640
we already have such a hard time

680
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,720
finishing plants where I live that you

681
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,919
really need to put that tent where where

682
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,960
you're going to get the most bang for

683
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,799
your buck in September and you know

684
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,679
other places October too but we can't we

685
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:19,599
can't grow in October here where I live

686
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:21,159
at all so right yeah so um all right so

687
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,798
um let's talk about now that we have

688
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,278
figured out where they're going to be in

689
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,798
our property let's talk about anchoring

690
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,319
them down um I think that a lot of

691
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:31,519
people just all like well it's a big

692
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,720
Greenhouse it's not going to fly away

693
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:37,599
and yes yes it's going to fly away if

694
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,558
you don't tie it down um I I I I don't

695
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:43,519
know what professionals use but all I've

696
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:46,200
done is I I I've picked up a really nice

697
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:50,120
um tent what do you call those tent

698
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:54,600
stakes and um I wrap a uh industrial

699
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:57,479
size zip uh zip tie around the bottom uh

700
00:27:54,599 --> 00:28:00,519
metal bar and and then I create a loop

701
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,640
with it and then put the um I put the

702
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:07,359
steak through it and I do you know on my

703
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,640
20 foot by 10 I will I'll put like you

704
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:13,359
know six of those on each side holding

705
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,720
it really down and you know occasionally

706
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:19,599
during the summer I might I might lose a

707
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:23,319
zip tie but not um not all the time um

708
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:25,558
what do what what do adults use

709
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:28,439
[Laughter]

710
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,119
like well I think there's a hand handful

711
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,919
of things that people do to secure their

712
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,119
green houses and I think all of them

713
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,960
could be looked at as a good good or

714
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:38,479
correct way to do it but um you know

715
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,120
sometimes things resonate with one

716
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,440
person better than or one idea resonates

717
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:47,678
with somebody better than the other idea

718
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,440
and so I think the bigger fancy um

719
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,278
stronger tent Stakes like you're talking

720
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,720
about are a great option um the other

721
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:57,679
thing that I've used is concrete stakes

722
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,038
and you know concrete stakes are you

723
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,080
know basically heavy metal bars with a

724
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,919
pointy end on it and they also have

725
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:07,158
holes drilled into it and so for me was

726
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,759
a lot of the green houses that we did

727
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,919
some of them we did as you know as Dem

728
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,599
uh as booths for trade shows and lounges

729
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,278
and you know there was other people that

730
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:17,519
wanted to do a similar Greenhouse but

731
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:19,720
they knew they were going to move it so

732
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,440
they didn't want to augur the holes and

733
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,480
cement them in like you're supposed to

734
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,440
like the plan say and so when some of

735
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,200
the green houses maybe have a baseboard

736
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,759
at the bottom it could be a small 2x4 or

737
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,200
something like that around the base

738
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:35,240
perimeter of the greenhouse um even if

739
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,919
there's not one but the tent the

740
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,880
concrete stakes uh work really well

741
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,880
because you can get them in a 8 in 12 in

742
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,120
24 in 36 in concrete steak so you can

743
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,679
really drive them down pretty good and

744
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:50,038
if you have it right up next to the

745
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,200
greenhouse you can use those holes that

746
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,960
are pre-drilled into that concrete stake

747
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,759
close to the top once it's all the way

748
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,159
tapped in and run some wire through it

749
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,879
run a zip tie through it or or even take

750
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,919
a screw and screw it right into the

751
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,799
baseboard and it it stays pretty well

752
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:09,000
attached and so concrete stakes have

753
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:11,240
been popular rebar cut up into various

754
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,319
lengths and section has been popular

755
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,038
kind of doing the similar thing there's

756
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,359
other people that have taken rebar and

757
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,839
bent it in half so it makes make kind of

758
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,558
like a horseshoe or a a u-shape so

759
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,278
you're basically driving it into the

760
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:27,480
ground maybe straddling something of the

761
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:30,398
greenhouse maybe a bottom um sideboard

762
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,599
or Lin or something that maybe you can

763
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,000
attach to and and do that with um

764
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,759
another thing that people have done is

765
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,919
similar to what you maybe see when

766
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:42,640
people put up those you know party tents

767
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:45,200
or circus type tents for um get

768
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,440
togethers and things is where they uh

769
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,159
actually throw the strap over you know a

770
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,960
ratchet strap over the entire greenhouse

771
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:55,120
and attach it to something that's fixed

772
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,840
into the ground and in some cases

773
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,518
there's been places where we've put

774
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:00,759
things up that we're not allowed to

775
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:04,359
drive staks into the ground so we fill

776
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:07,038
up um a bucket with um cement so you'll

777
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,719
take a 5 Gall bucket dump a cement bag

778
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,398
into it and fill it with water and you

779
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,038
basically have this hardened cement

780
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:16,158
bucket for a lack of better words and

781
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,240
some people will even put a fancy hook

782
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,519
maybe inside that concrete so then it

783
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,159
dries you actually have something to

784
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,839
hook to that concrete inside the bucket

785
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,480
and so people will put the buckets

786
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,199
around the perimeter of the greenhouse

787
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,599
throw these straps over the the

788
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,319
greenhouse and then attach them to these

789
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,199
buckets and so it's not to be ratcheted

790
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:38,158
down so tight that it's actually pulling

791
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,319
your Greenhouse down but it avoids it

792
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:45,278
from being able to take off or lift off

793
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:47,439
listening to you uh uh kind of uh name

794
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:51,558
off all these different solutions I just

795
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,399
felt so proud of of Stoner Ingenuity you

796
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,678
know like like you take these plus all

797
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:57,518
the ones that we're not even going to

798
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,960
mention like people are always figuring

799
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,638
stuff and new in novel ways in our scene

800
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,880
oh for sure I think you know you could

801
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:06,519
take whatever we just explained and and

802
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,880
hybridize it or do it a little bit

803
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,960
differently with the same parts and then

804
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,240
you and I learn something totally it

805
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,360
does it it doesn't surprise me that

806
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,200
we've already mentioned Joey Berger as

807
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:21,599
as an Innovative cannabis person because

808
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,399
he's always he's always posting about oh

809
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,638
I'm trying this new thing you know and I

810
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,398
I really appreciate people who are you

811
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:29,879
know thought leaders like that right

812
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,558
yeah necessity is the mother of

813
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,519
invention and when you're you know when

814
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:37,000
you've smoked a couple it really can go

815
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:39,798
you can really go out there with it yeah

816
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,240
all right so let's talk about um uh the

817
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:46,038
skin when the plastic is is put on um

818
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,278
the the only and and biggest issue that

819
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:54,319
I have run into with um a season of

820
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:57,919
plastic is when there is rain um it is

821
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:01,158
often um it often creates uh like div

822
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,200
it's in the plastic where uh water will

823
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,159
collect now people who have got more

824
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,798
professional green houses will

825
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,639
immediately say oh it's not it's you

826
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,200
know it's not pulled tight enough you

827
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:15,240
have to you know you have to have like

828
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,480
channel locks on either side of the

829
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,240
greenhouse to to Really you know lock

830
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,519
that in but the this these these green

831
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,798
houses are are much too small for that I

832
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,638
forget what those things are called that

833
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,519
little the little wiggle wire what's

834
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:30,439
that y that's what it's called wiggle is

835
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,919
it called Wiggle wire all great um so

836
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,440
it's like the these green houses are

837
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,080
just too small for that and like you

838
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,759
know you could but you'd probably double

839
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,879
the price of the greenhouse by adding

840
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:45,000
wiggle wire minimum so so so really what

841
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,799
we're talking about is um ways to

842
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,638
support the roof differently and this

843
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:53,240
year was the first year that I tried

844
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:57,240
just simply to run rope back and forth

845
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,278
between the ribs that would create um

846
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,319
addition

847
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:03,159
support in between the ribs and it

848
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,480
worked out it worked out okay I

849
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,600
definitely took it all apart and I'm

850
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,398
going to try it again next year with

851
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:13,159
with a a um a thinner rope wrapped more

852
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,358
times but is is there anything at the

853
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,559
professional level that you recommend to

854
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:21,838
people to to help fill in those gaps

855
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,960
between the ribs so that the water

856
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,279
doesn't create like little

857
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,320
buckets yeah I mean that happens even on

858
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,240
big green houses or or you know

859
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,838
traditional green houses

860
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,118
or commercial gray whatever but I mean

861
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,960
it it does come down to sometimes the

862
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,480
way these things are manufactured and

863
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,519
how the plastic goes on and you know

864
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,480
nine times out of 10 not everything's

865
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:50,039
100% ideal but it's close enough and you

866
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,119
know I do suggest to make sure that when

867
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:54,759
people do put their Plastics on they try

868
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,119
to do it on a sunny day you know it's

869
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,000
good to pull out the plastic and maybe

870
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,640
lay it on top of the greenhouse or on

871
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,920
the ground right next to the greenhouse

872
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,078
and let it get hot and that way it a lot

873
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,599
of times as as most people know when

874
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,880
things are warm they're a little bit

875
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,079
more pliable or malleable and and when

876
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,240
things are cold they're a little bit

877
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,280
more stiff and harder to deal with and

878
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:20,919
and most if not all Greenhouse Plastics

879
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,200
are the same way and so it's good to lay

880
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,159
it out let it get warm and really try to

881
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,759
stretch it on as tight as possible so

882
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:29,279
that when it does cool down that

883
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:34,520
contraction you know is what creates

884
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:36,519
that tighter um fit so to to basically

885
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:38,880
hold things on a little bit better It's

886
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:41,440
Tricky I've seen people use you know the

887
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,200
the really sticky fancy velcro from Home

888
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,838
Depot to try to rig things up um you

889
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:49,399
know using LA or PVC in conjunction with

890
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,519
the ropes like you talked about to

891
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,480
create peins and things that go between

892
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,480
each rib to try to create the rigidity

893
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,719
you know

894
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,039
rigid um or create make the the

895
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:02,039
structure more rigid so it doesn't

896
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:03,358
always help the plastic but sometimes

897
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,679
when you're messing around with things

898
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,279
like you're talking about you know you

899
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:08,919
go in and you do something and maybe it

900
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,960
works pretty good and a lot of times we

901
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,440
have this aha moment going well if I was

902
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,838
to do this again I'd do it this way and

903
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,358
it sounds like that's kind of where you

904
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:20,440
are with your you know possibili that's

905
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:22,920
exactly where I am the the the first

906
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,800
year I did this I tried packing tape and

907
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,559
that was great but it broke over the

908
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,640
course of the year just from the weather

909
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,559
and then and then this year was rope um

910
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,199
but but I need I need to come up with a

911
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,960
different pattern so that it gets more

912
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:39,199
coverage yeah no and and you know in

913
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,920
some cases you know if you thumb through

914
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,838
some of the greenhouse cataloges you

915
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,200
know I mean there's the catalogs that

916
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:48,519
get sent to you in the mail there's the

917
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:50,879
online ones you know like Greenhouse

918
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:52,480
mega store for instance U there's some

919
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,519
others out there on the East Coast like

920
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,920
Griffin greenhouse and I would say that

921
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,800
you know sometimes when you're going

922
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,240
through these catalogs and these online

923
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,119
things you run into new things that you

924
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:06,118
know could be applicable to a homeg grow

925
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,960
greenhouse and so they do sell a lot of

926
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,760
do-it-yourself parts for creating um

927
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,559
backyard and maybe hom grow or

928
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,079
do-it-yourself green houses but at the

929
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,559
same time there are certain parts and

930
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,760
things that we run into that could be

931
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:21,400
useful in whatever Greenhouse you're

932
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,920
using or you know the one that you're

933
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,000
talking about in particular and so you

934
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,599
know sometimes there's stuff out there

935
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,960
that's been around for a long time we we

936
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,640
just haven't noticed it because we're

937
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,119
flipping through the pages so fast

938
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,719
looking for something else and so

939
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,720
surprisingly enough that I mean there's

940
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,439
even a place here in Grass Valley called

941
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,959
Peaceful Valley Farm Supply that ships a

942
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,119
lot of stuff and over the years they've

943
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,280
had Greenhouse Parts too so it's just a

944
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,240
matter of kind of looking around and and

945
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,720
you know really trying to engage in what

946
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,639
you're what you're doing for your

947
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:56,759
plastic and seeing if any of these other

948
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:59,118
things might fit or work or or help in

949
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,280
any ways but I would say that generally

950
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,039
speaking getting greenhouse plastic

951
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,440
tight so that it doesn't hold water is

952
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:09,800
pretty common for everybody in the hoop

953
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,079
house and and Greenhouse game because um

954
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,280
you know weather Mother Nature is pretty

955
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,119
powerful and she typically always wins

956
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,319
in one way or the other and so I would

957
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,280
say that it it it's kind of a

958
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:26,759
ongoing uh situation to be worked on

959
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,000
yeah I I agree uh it's it's hard a lot

960
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,680
of these uh a lot of these at the green

961
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,318
houses at this grade the plastic is just

962
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,838
held on with velcro hoops and so they

963
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:40,519
can slide all over the the galvanized

964
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,480
steel um so anything that that we can do

965
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:45,440
to to

966
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,719
um anchor them to the ground is going to

967
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,280
be a win so the last the last thing I

968
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:51,879
want to talk about is actually the

969
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,280
ground um on this topic before we go to

970
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,440
the first break and that is whether or

971
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,920
not to put flooring and you know I've

972
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,838
really been torn on this over the years

973
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:07,079
on one hand um I have uh liked leaving

974
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:09,279
my greenhouses just bare dirt um because

975
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,960
you know I'm a grower of the soil food

976
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,280
web mindedness and and the idea of

977
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:19,440
having the floor be natural um and there

978
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,519
so that there are uh you know voluntary

979
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,200
pest predators that are growing there

980
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,358
naturally and and um you know the water

981
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:28,919
has somewhere to soak down into it just

982
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:32,078
seems like it makes sense to me

983
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,079
however you know if we've got un uneven

984
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,480
ground where there are all these like

985
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,318
little divots that you can twist your

986
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,280
ankle in or if you live like where I

987
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:42,079
live where we've got a lot of uh

988
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,160
varmints you know you've suddenly got

989
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,800
them um growing um uh like little holes

990
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,399
underneath your pot so they can drink

991
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,519
the water during the drought of the

992
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,200
summer right um uh it's it really goes

993
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,000
both ways about whether just to leave

994
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,318
the ground um natural with grass or

995
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,318
whether or not it makes sense to put

996
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:02,759
down a couple pieces of plywood how do

997
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:05,239
you weigh in on

998
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,520
this yeah that's that's a good question

999
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:11,318
I mean for the hom grower I think that

1000
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,960
you know it's it's really up to you know

1001
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:14,759
what their perspective is on all this

1002
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,559
stuff and you brought up a lot of good

1003
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,480
points I mean there there's definitely

1004
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,519
beneficials and there's definitely some

1005
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,318
things that aren't beneficial that could

1006
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,519
show up in some cases and so I would say

1007
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:27,358
that if it's just plain dirt without

1008
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,800
grass it's good to put something down

1009
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,719
down because when you're irrigating or

1010
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,440
if some rains come or whatever that that

1011
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,759
dirt does get wet and it tracks up mud

1012
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,200
and next thing you know you're starting

1013
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,640
to get stuff everywhere and it becomes

1014
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,960
quite messy I've even had people on you

1015
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,759
know just plain dirt put down the ground

1016
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,000
cover that's been recommended over the

1017
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,280
years and when that stuff gets wet from

1018
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,199
irrigating or leaving a hose on or just

1019
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,880
dribbling around when you're moving from

1020
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:58,000
place to place with a hose the mud will

1021
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,559
start to seep through the ground cover

1022
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,400
even so it's I think the idea of having

1023
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,199
the grass is pretty cool um you know

1024
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,160
people can be fearful of the pest

1025
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,239
because the grass can be a nice little

1026
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:13,078
habitat for things that you maybe don't

1027
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,838
want um when it comes to the rodents the

1028
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,920
rodents are definitely a little bit of a

1029
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:19,799
problem and so putting down some wire

1030
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,960
mesh underneath maybe could help keep

1031
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,640
the rodents from coming up and getting

1032
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,800
through um you know the plywood isn't a

1033
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:30,199
bad idea some people are a little bit

1034
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,560
iffy plywood or wood in general because

1035
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,399
there's the chance you know in the

1036
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,078
regulated market what we learned is that

1037
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,200
you know wood and cardboard and a lot of

1038
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,160
these things can have this aspergillis

1039
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,519
and maybe even cause some post Harvest

1040
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:45,318
molds but a lot of that is a whole

1041
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:49,800
another podcast to deal with but um at

1042
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:52,159
the same time um wood can get moldy just

1043
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,640
by nature in general and so that can be

1044
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,879
a little bit of a thing for people if

1045
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:57,960
you use pressure treated wood it has

1046
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,760
chemicals in it and some cases some of

1047
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,280
those chemicals could um bioaccumulate

1048
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,880
in your cannabis and so it's really um

1049
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,880
kind of tricky I know that you know

1050
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,400
another popular solution people like to

1051
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,079
go find those plastic pallets I mean I

1052
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,599
don't know if they're plastic or

1053
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,480
polycarbonate or what they're really

1054
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,079
made of but the pallets that um are not

1055
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,079
made of wood they can be fairly

1056
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:22,359
expensive sometimes you can find people

1057
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:25,000
tossing those and use those um um you

1058
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:28,318
know at the end of the day I think that

1059
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,960
um anything re reasonable would work and

1060
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,000
so a pallet could be used but that's

1061
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,318
wood also a regular wooden pallet but

1062
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,079
there's people that will paint those

1063
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:41,440
with a low vo paint maybe even um a hemp

1064
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,559
deck stain for that matter um there's

1065
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,679
also you know just putting some gravel

1066
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,440
down isn't a bad idea over the dirt in

1067
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:51,199
some cases so I mean a little bit of

1068
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,720
gravel goes long ways um you know if you

1069
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,399
do use the ground cover I would you know

1070
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:58,159
recommend putting something underneath

1071
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,599
it maybe even some straw before you cap

1072
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,078
it with the ground cover just so you

1073
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,920
don't have the mud that comes through um

1074
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,760
but you know when using the containers

1075
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,680
that you're using some of the containers

1076
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,200
can take up a lot of space as well and

1077
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:15,039
so those cover the ground when people

1078
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:17,759
are doing these beds or rais beds a lot

1079
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:20,440
of times they will even use bark around

1080
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,160
the beds as a mulch layer and and you

1081
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:26,280
know bark is pretty pretty safe in most

1082
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:28,719
regards for the fact that um the weeds

1083
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,319
don't like to grow through it as easy it

1084
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,318
doesn't get muddy and some of the bark

1085
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,920
doesn't seem to have the same moldy

1086
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:38,440
effects um or negative effects that you

1087
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,760
know wood does like plywood or things a

1088
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,280
lot of times the mulch from wood chips

1089
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,040
can have a lot of beneficial qualities

1090
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,359
to it with um you know the fun fungi

1091
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:50,800
growing into it and having that

1092
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:53,759
mycelial mat growing and it keeps the

1093
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,519
weeds from growing through and and uh it

1094
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,119
makes for a nice uh cooler atmosphere it

1095
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:01,199
doesn't get too hot like some of the

1096
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:03,200
other things do I would just be on the

1097
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,838
cautious side and knowing that you know

1098
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,039
maybe if someone was to use certain

1099
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:09,358
Ground Covers like black you know black

1100
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,400
can get really hot in the summertime and

1101
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,239
it can heat up the greenhouse more than

1102
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,200
you want it to and maybe have adverse

1103
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:17,879
reactions to the environment in the

1104
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:20,078
greenhouse just because it stores and

1105
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,838
collects so much energy you know it

1106
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,359
could be a benefit to some people though

1107
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,039
that are in places maybe like the

1108
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,119
islands or areas where it stays fairly

1109
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,039
cooler and they're trying to get some of

1110
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,720
that free heat into the greenhouse and

1111
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:34,279
warm some things up um on the other side

1112
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,000
of that would be using you know

1113
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,480
something that's a lighter color a white

1114
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,318
ground cover it's kind of the other side

1115
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,599
of that is why over the years we've

1116
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:46,440
recommended people use a tan grow bag

1117
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,680
versus a black grow bag um and that's

1118
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,400
because they just get way more hot than

1119
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,399
a you know black gets way more hot than

1120
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,920
a tan grow bag but again that can be a

1121
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,760
benefit in some areas I just went to a

1122
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,760
farm recently that

1123
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,319
um does put down the black this time of

1124
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,359
the year because it is colder and

1125
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:05,400
they're trying to get as much free

1126
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:10,358
energy as they can and so they do switch

1127
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:12,358
the colors up for their Fall Run um but

1128
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:13,799
you know and and the other part of that

1129
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:15,480
is that you know if you're going to be

1130
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,119
using your Greenhouse in the winter time

1131
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,039
or the summertime so you really kind of

1132
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,119
want to be strategic if it's only the

1133
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,239
summertime then you might be able to get

1134
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,680
away with you know just a lot less or a

1135
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,118
thinner layer of something and uh and if

1136
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,598
you're going through the winter then I

1137
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,720
would recommend probably going into some

1138
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,800
type of a gravel base to start with you

1139
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,239
might cap the gravel with the ground

1140
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,960
cover you know a pallet or wood or

1141
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:43,239
something else but the gravel is really

1142
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,400
helpful in the winter time to keep from

1143
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:49,399
sinking into the

1144
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:52,240
mud wow uh all right so first of all I

1145
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,559
love having you on the show Eric because

1146
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,558
you have such a depth of experience as

1147
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,960
as you gave that elaborate answer I was

1148
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,440
going through every one of the

1149
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,639
situations and and it brought to mind

1150
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,000
two things number one how you always

1151
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:08,519
teach that there's no right way to do it

1152
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,400
there's the best way to do it for where

1153
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,480
you are in the country what your weather

1154
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,760
is like what your growing goals and what

1155
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,838
your budget is right and and so you gave

1156
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,079
us a bunch of options depending on what

1157
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,318
our goals are and I dig that and also

1158
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,440
listening hearing you go through the

1159
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:25,119
list I can almost see you go like oh man

1160
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,720
that guy did this and we had to fix it

1161
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,880
and this guy did this and we had to fix

1162
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,919
it and like you're really kind of going

1163
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,640
through a greatest hits of problems and

1164
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,639
solutions that you've had to deal with

1165
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:37,558
with different

1166
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,440
clients it it yeah I mean unfortunately

1167
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,160
maybe fortunately for me unfortunately

1168
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,639
for some of the Growers that I've showed

1169
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:45,159
up you know a lot of the work that I've

1170
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,358
done is to help people in the kind of a

1171
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:49,598
rescue situation or showing up to work

1172
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:53,400
on one thing and I see another problem

1173
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,960
going on and and and it it just you know

1174
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,720
it's been a lot of years of being able

1175
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,358
to see what works and what doesn't work

1176
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:58,919
and

1177
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,799
it's not to say like you're saying you

1178
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,000
know there's not one thing that is

1179
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,160
better than the other it just every Farm

1180
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,800
is different there's not one Canabis

1181
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:10,838
farm that is exactly the same and that's

1182
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,000
even here in California I mean every

1183
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:15,239
Greenhouse I go to has a different way

1184
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,079
of setting it up or doing it or heating

1185
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:19,118
it or the flooring for it you know so I

1186
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:22,000
mean and it's the same way across the

1187
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,318
country um and you know the bigger the

1188
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,079
fancier the greenhouse the less similar

1189
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:28,759
it is to any other greenhouse and then

1190
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,800
when you get to the very basic simple

1191
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,319
you know home jobs you get to actually

1192
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,000
see a lot of cool stuff but in cannabis

1193
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:36,759
and in growing in general whether you're

1194
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,838
doing vegetables or cannabis but it

1195
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,400
seems like with cannabis especially

1196
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:42,960
there's always you know two steps

1197
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,800
forward and one step back um and that's

1198
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,358
not necessarily a bad thing but it's

1199
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,800
really you know not something that is a

1200
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,920
perfect situation all the time yeah

1201
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,760
especially when you're burning money so

1202
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,039
yeah right so um all right cool well

1203
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,200
we're going to go ahead and take take a

1204
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,079
short break and be right back you are

1263
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,000
revenue is tight for cannabis businesses

1264
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,199
right now there is no question about it

1265
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,039
and when Revenue tightens businesses

1266
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:30,798
need to spend Smarter on Advertising

1267
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,558
instead of throwing obscene money at

1268
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:35,039
Hanging your company's logo from the

1269
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,119
rafters at your next convention perhaps

1270
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,519
consider placing commercials on shaping

1271
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,640
fire and if you are a very small

1272
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,159
business there is simply no better bang

1273
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:45,598
for your buck than commercials on

1274
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:47,838
shaping fire especially if your products

1275
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,240
are for regeneratively minded

1276
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:52,039
cultivators advertising on this show

1277
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,479
allows us time to talk about your

1278
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:56,039
product service or brand in a way that

1279
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,679
really lets people know what sets your

1280
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:00,599
company apart apart from the others bold

1281
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:02,239
people who own companies know that

1282
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,838
getting into relationship with their

1283
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:07,439

offer we will explain your service or

1285

1286
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,480

00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:15,920
with you it's pretty simple really

1288
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,798
advertising does not have to be all

1289
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,240
whizbang smok and mirrors nowadays I

1290
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:23,239
find that people prefer just to be

1291
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,479
spoken to calmly accurately and with

1292
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:28,159
good intentions if you want to make your

1293
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,159
own commercial spot you can do that too

1294

more one of the challenges with buying

1315
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:20,159
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1316
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:22,798
have as many different fenos as you will

1317
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,639
have seeds in a pack that can be fun

1318
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:27,719
sure but so many varieties in one pack

1319
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:30,558
is a sign of an an immature seed line

1320
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:32,239
that hasn't been worked enough I prefer

1321
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,000
my autof flowers to be worked enough

1322
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,639
that each pheno in the pack really

1323
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,440
captures the aspects that the breeder

1324
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:39,358
was

1325
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,079
intending this is why I recommend gnome

1326
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:43,239

1329
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:50,480

1330
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,798
painstakingly sifted again and again

1331
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,000
tested in a wide range of conditions and

1332
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:56,960
taken to a level of maturity that each

1333
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,719
plant will be recognizable by

1363
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:13,440
Shango Los and my guest today is

1364
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:15,440
greenhouse consultant Eric Branstad so

1365
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,880
during the first set we we figured out

1366
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,000
where our Greenhouse is going to be on

1367
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,640
the property and we got it all set up

1368
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,318
let's start talking about how to deal

1369
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:26,679
with some of the common challenges that

1370
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:31,880
are involved with having a greenhouse

1371
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:35,039
and let's start with heat um uh you talk

1372
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:40,000
uh regularly about the difficulties of

1373
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:42,358
abating heat in our greenhouse and um

1374
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,119
this is something that we attract right

1375
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:47,119
because we want the warmth and we want

1376
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:49,200
the heat uh because the plants want it

1377
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,559
but we also don't want to cook the

1378
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:54,679
plants or make them too thirsty or dry

1379
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:56,440
out our pots and so we're trying to get

1380
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:00,039
um you know we're just trying to hit the

1381
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:06,079
this sweet spot so um I'm assuming that

1382
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:08,920
our number one um helper Ally for G for

1383
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,920
keeping our heat low is going to be fans

1384
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,280
but um but I know that you have got a

1385
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,358
bunch of strategies so so so why don't I

1386
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,960
just kind of hand you the mic and say

1387
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:20,039
what are the things that we should be

1388
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,559
thinking about um for abating the heat

1389
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:24,838
when we're setting up our small you know

1390
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,920
20 by 10 foot

1391
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:29,599
Greenhouse sure I mean you know

1392
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,358
primarily the greenhouse itself

1393
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,960
hopefully has some ventilation and I

1394
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,639
know the one that you're talking about

1395
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,639
actually does with the big door in the

1396
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:39,440
front and then down the side it has all

1397
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:42,358
these windows that roll up or

1398
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:45,720
open and so similarly to other greenh

1399
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:49,119
houses or well let's back up here a lot

1400
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:51,199
of the other hobby green houses also did

1401
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,039
not have or not equipped with enough

1402
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,480
ventilation so a lot of times they have

1403
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,920
a just a little Louver that opens by

1404
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,519
hand and

1405
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,838
maybe there's one on the roof or

1406
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:03,038
whatever and so historically speaking

1407
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:04,639
most of the hobby green houses that have

1408
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:07,200
been on the market turn into little

1409
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:08,639
storage sheds in the summertime and then

1410
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:10,960
they don't get used in the winter

1411
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,400
because people are happy with storing

1412
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,400
stuff in them and it's because they get

1413
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,920
incredibly hot and the other thing

1414
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:20,079
people forget is that you know green

1415
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,720
houses were invented for the winter or

1416
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,839
when it's really shitty out not when

1417
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:26,759
it's you know a perfect hot sunny day

1418
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:29,318
but when cannabis came along we all you

1419
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,920
know grow the best time to grow is when

1420
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:33,838
it's hot summer and the sun's out and so

1421
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,519
boom we put these green houses out there

1422
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,920
that are not really for that time of the

1423
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,239
year and we have all these problems or

1424
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,159
heat build up and so you know like I

1425
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,919
said the vents are really crucial um you

1426
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:48,239
know looking at these Greenhouse covers

1427
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,559
is also um an important factor and so

1428
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,719
the clear the cover or the the

1429
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:55,160
polycarbonate the more exposure to the

1430
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:58,239
plants that we have and so one of the

1431
00:56:55,159 --> 00:57:00,798
things that people talk about is you

1432
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,679
know the word heat but we're not just

1433
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:05,119
talking about the air temp we're talking

1434
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:08,399
about the heat that is associated to the

1435
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:10,079
plant and so there's two different um

1436
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,039
things that I look at in the greenhouse

1437
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,160
and so one might be the air temp

1438
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:17,119
obviously but the other is going to be

1439
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:19,239
the plant temperature itself and and you

1440
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,798
know we look at that by simply even

1441
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:23,558
using a handheld laser thermometer where

1442
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:25,639
you point and the little laser comes out

1443
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:27,280
and it you point it to where you want

1444
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:29,598
and it tells the temperature of these

1445
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,319
surfaces and so it's really handy to

1446
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:34,880
take one of those devices and aim it at

1447
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,719
the flower of your plant or even a leaf

1448
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,880
and you can actually see that the plant

1449
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:43,279
temp is typically different than the air

1450
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,838
temperature and so um monitoring that

1451
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,599
really helps a lot more than just

1452
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:48,599
looking at the air temp because in some

1453
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:52,240
cases if you have enough ventilation and

1454
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:54,920
maybe a good greenhouse cover um that

1455
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:57,479
isn't totally clear like glass you might

1456
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,720
see that there could be reduction in

1457
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,960
leaf surface or plant temp compared to

1458
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:04,639
the air temp and if that's the case

1459
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,960
you're on the right track or things will

1460
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:08,759
probably be okay but if it's the

1461
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,920
opposite where the greenhouse is warm

1462
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,799
inside and the plant temp is actually

1463
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,838
warmer than the than the air temp you're

1464
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:18,639
bound to run into problems with powdery

1465
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,920
milw mold you know Bettis type mold and

1466
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:24,118
things like that it's just it's it's not

1467
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,440
going to end well um so what we try to

1468
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:27,079
look at is that you know like you

1469
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,200
brought up fan hands are definitely a

1470
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:31,039
popular thing to move some air around

1471
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,960
but if it's still sealed up and there's

1472
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,599
not enough fresh air coming in um it's

1473
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,880
it the fans are just going to move that

1474
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,920
air around and so the one thing that I

1475
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,240
always like to tell people and and the

1476
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,720
phrase that I like to you know live by a

1477
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,118
little bit is that if you trap air it

1478
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,959
will heat up and so the key for a

1479
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,079
greenhouse in the summertime especially

1480
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,960
a homeg grower and even you know maybe a

1481
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,119
commercial grower that has not such a

1482
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:59,519
fancy setup you know kind of a basic

1483
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:02,000
coup house is that uh we want to not

1484
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:04,038
trap that air so that it heats up and

1485
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,159
how do we do that is we try to take away

1486
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:08,319
this greenhouse effect and so it's okay

1487
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:09,960
to have the greenhouse but it's not

1488
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:11,400
always okay to have the greenhouse

1489
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,960
effect where it's getting warmer and

1490
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,079
warmer inside all the time um we can

1491
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,199
break that by opening up the greenhouse

1492
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,559
and avoiding trapping all that air and

1493
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:22,439
so you know on a greenhouse like the one

1494
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,079
you've showed pictures of you know in a

1495
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,480
place that maybe gets really hot I would

1496
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:29,680
say that the benefit would be to put

1497
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,838
doors at both ends of that type of a

1498
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:34,480
greenhouse and that way it really slows

1499
00:59:32,838 --> 00:59:36,000
down the ability for that a to be

1500
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,719
trapped and so when we have these

1501
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,119
openings let's say we just have one door

1502
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,038
the windows are open you still might

1503
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,798
have a little bit of solar gain it might

1504
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:47,400
not have the same amount of solar gain

1505
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:49,519
if everything was sealed up uh but you

1506
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,358
know it still has a little bit of solar

1507
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,199
gain it's a little bit warmer inside

1508
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,838
than it is outside but if we put that

1509
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:57,480
other door at the other end you know we

1510
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:59,119
might might have now alleviated the

1511
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,599
ability for it to act like a total

1512
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,640
greenhouse and we're going to actually

1513
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:04,760
see the same temperatures inside the

1514
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:07,118
greenhouse as we do

1515
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,839
outside and so some people might say

1516
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,599
well it's 100° outside that's okay if

1517
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:14,358
it's 100° inside the greenhouse we know

1518
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:16,240
that we've avoided the solar gain we're

1519
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:18,400
not going to get it cooler by any means

1520
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:21,679
but the goal is to not let it get more

1521
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:24,559
hot inside than it is outside and so if

1522
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:26,879
we've um if we've gotten to that point

1523
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,760
then we start monitoring the leaf

1524
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,000
surface or the flower temperature of the

1525
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,440
plant with our little laser thermometer

1526
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,599
and what we're going to start to notice

1527
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,000
is that you know maybe those

1528
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,119
temperatures are similar to each other

1529
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,880
or in fact maybe a little bit lower and

1530
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:42,079
so we're definitely on the right track

1531
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,358
and this is where some circulation fans

1532
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,760
might actually help a little bit because

1533
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:48,639
now once we've avoided the solar gain we

1534
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,559
move a little air across the plants and

1535
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,920
it might be in a racetrack pattern it

1536
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,240
might just be one fan at one end blowing

1537
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,880
across this small Greenhouse so that it

1538
01:00:55,239 --> 01:01:00,159
creates a slight Breeze or mimics a

1539
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,039
slight breeze and what ends up happening

1540
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:03,679
is the plants actually become a little

1541
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:06,079
bit cooler than what they originally

1542
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:08,558
were and so when I have leaves kind of

1543
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,318
dancing in the circulation of the of the

1544
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:13,680
fans we can see a 3 to 5 degree

1545
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:16,159
temperature difference than we would if

1546
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:18,558
the plants weren't experiencing any air

1547
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:20,399
movement and so you know plants and

1548
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,880
people are similar in the sense that

1549
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,639
plants have all this water moving

1550
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,920
through their system just like we have

1551
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:29,000
blood and our blood's like I don't know

1552
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:31,200
70 or 90% water anyway and so we have

1553
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,199
this circulation going on right between

1554
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:35,838
ourselves and plants with this water

1555
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:39,000
moving through everything and so you

1556
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:41,199
know on a hot day if you go and stand in

1557
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,798
front of a fan it'll have a cooling

1558
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,919
effect on our body because our sweat you

1559
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:47,838
know our perspiration basically is

1560
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,639
starting to get cooled off and

1561
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:52,960
eventually we might even stop perspiring

1562
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:55,480
even though we're still out in you know

1563
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:58,679
the hot weather this fan is created a

1564
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:01,159
littleit bit of relief for us and and so

1565
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:03,440
plants are the same way and so a plant

1566
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:06,598
doesn't perspire like a person does it

1567
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,760
transpires right and so as the plant is

1568
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:11,240
transpiring and we start to blow some

1569
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,799
air across it it will eventually start

1570
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:15,078
to cool down a little bit and that

1571
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:18,159
transpiration process doesn't go away

1572
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:19,680
but it uh slows down quite a bit and

1573
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,679
anybody that's had a plant that is

1574
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:23,519
transpiring it's hard to see because

1575
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,519
it's not like sweat on our forehead you

1576
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,960
can't just see it dripping down but what

1577
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:30,119
we see is we see condensation forming on

1578
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,838
the roof of the greenhouse and trying to

1579
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:34,960
drip back down onto our plants and so

1580
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:37,599
condensation typically is a result of

1581
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,240
plant transpiration and so if we try to

1582
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,519
work on getting our plant temps in check

1583
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:44,798
we'll be able to avoid that condensation

1584
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:47,599
that everybody is trying to avoid or get

1585
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:49,079
rid of and and not deal with and that

1586
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,838
you know kind of coincides with the

1587
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:52,599
light depth technique when you put your

1588
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:54,558
plants in a light dep You Know cover

1589
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:57,400
them in this bubble with the blackout

1590
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,720
cover um there's no air coming in or out

1591
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,639
a lot of times especially traditional

1592
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:04,598
ways of growing and if your plant temps

1593
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,400
or or your plant temps are up when you

1594
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:09,000
go to seal it up you're instantly going

1595
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,680
to see this condensation form and so

1596
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,559
people that are able to keep their plant

1597
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:15,078
temps down compared to the air temp and

1598
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:16,760
that's why I'm saying there's not a

1599
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:18,960
perfect number that we're looking for

1600
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,359
we're just looking for plant temp to be

1601
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,119
lower than the air temp you typically

1602
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:24,960
don't see that condensation form

1603
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,599
throughout the day and you don't see it

1604
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,960
show up as much when you pull your light

1605
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,278
depth cover and so another thing that

1606
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,960
helps with that is the greenhouse cover

1607
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:36,880
itself and you know knowing that you

1608
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,199
have that green cover on your

1609
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,960
Greenhouse it does provide a little bit

1610
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:43,798
of diffusion it has the reinforcing

1611
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,278
strings that go through there that makes

1612
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:48,239
that cover you know more durable than it

1613
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:52,119
would be if it was just a plain piece of

1614
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:55,399
plastic um does provide some diffusion

1615
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:57,640
and so basically the diffusion is also

1616
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:01,480
maybe another way of looking at shading

1617
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:03,879
you know or or um another aspect of

1618
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,559
diffusion is scattering infrared and so

1619
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:08,400
infrared is what brings the Heat and so

1620
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,200
we're basically trying to disrupt the

1621
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,318
infrared but we're still trying to get

1622
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:15,480
as much light as possible um and to the

1623
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:18,278
plant and so a lot of times with the

1624
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,039
clear like glass covers you don't have

1625
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:21,838
that protection they actually can

1626
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:23,760
magnify the light at times and it'll

1627
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,558
make the plant temp even warmer than it

1628
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,960
should be or warmer than you want it to

1629
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:30,839
be be just because that's how these

1630
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,480
Plastics work and so um originally when

1631
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:33,880
I first started selling green houses

1632
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,079
that's what we originally thought we

1633
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,599
want the clearest cover possible like

1634
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,680
glass because outdoor plants are in the

1635
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:43,359
full sun you know when we're growing

1636
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,278
with lights indoors back in the day

1637
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:46,880
before LEDs and all this people wanted

1638
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:48,480
as many lights as possible and they

1639
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,798
wanted them turned up as high as

1640
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,240
possible and so we automatically thought

1641
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:53,759
the same thing for going into our

1642
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:57,000
Greenhouse but what we learned is the

1643
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:00,039
sun is intense um you know it's the most

1644
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,679
intense light bulb we have around and so

1645
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:05,559
um a lot of times the overexposure to

1646
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:07,838
plants can be too much throughout the

1647
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:09,559
growing cycle and so having the right

1648
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:12,960
Greenhouse cover and I believe the green

1649
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:14,960
one that you you know in that picture um

1650
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,240
is a great option for doing that and

1651
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:21,679
then I know that the upgraded version is

1652
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:23,798
a white and I've you know seen a white

1653
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:25,399
um I forget the product name of it but

1654
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:26,759
it's a white you can't see through it

1655
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,039
and almost didn't think it was a

1656
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,240
greenhouse cover it's a sunm they have a

1657
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,079
bunch of different versions and this

1658
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:35,679
white one actually does let light

1659
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:39,119
through and it worked incredibly well in

1660
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:41,719
Arizona so I'm assuming that the white

1661
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,240
upgraded version that they have offering

1662
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:46,480
for your Greenhouse uh would be suitable

1663
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,479
in some of these areas like Arizona New

1664
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,000
Mexico and even California where it can

1665
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,400
be extremely hot sometimes where that

1666
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,440
white will actually

1667
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,200
diffuse um and calm down that infrared

1668
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,000
or that heat that's being brought onto

1669
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:02,558
the plants but still provide enough

1670
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,159
light for a great growing cycle so in

1671
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,680
some cases somebody might just use the

1672
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:08,679
openness of the greenhouse for

1673
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:11,118
ventilation to take away the greenhouse

1674
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:13,440
effect on top of that they might use the

1675
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:15,760
greenhouse cover to make sure that that

1676
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,159
you know helps or works even better and

1677
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,278
then the other thing would be adding

1678
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:21,480
that circulation fan now somebody might

1679
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:24,079
want to do all of these things into one

1680
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,440
aspect of a greenhouse to have the most

1681
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:29,599
you know support or protection and then

1682
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,358
in some areas of the country one of

1683
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:35,720
those things might do the

1684
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:37,318
job um as far as the one one more

1685
01:06:35,719 --> 01:06:40,679
question about the fans before we go on

1686
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:44,440
to cold so it's from what you just said

1687
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:49,159
it sounds like a uh positive strategy

1688
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:54,400
would be a for example a box fan set up

1689
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:56,798
as an intake at one end of the uh

1690
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,160
Greenhouse and I've got I've got mine

1691
01:06:56,798 --> 01:07:03,798
hung just simply with zel velcro not

1692
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:07,278
velcro zip tie um to the rib and then at

1693
01:07:03,798 --> 01:07:10,480
the other end you have um a an an

1694
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:13,440
exhalation end and so it creates this

1695
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,480
the comes one in in one end and it's

1696
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:19,039
being pulled out the exhaust end at the

1697
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:21,039
other side and then maybe um for the

1698
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,720
leaf temperature maybe a couple

1699
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,799
oscillating fans in the middle so I've

1700
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:28,000
got an intake on one end an exhaust on

1701
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:29,880
the other end and then a couple of

1702
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,199
exhaust fans in the middle just kind of

1703
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,039
like moving the air around on the inside

1704
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:37,798
is is that kind of what you were

1705
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:39,680
describing yeah I I yes yes and no and

1706
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:41,559
the reason that I say the no part of it

1707
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:43,078
is is because here's a couple things and

1708
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:45,720
I'm not necessarily directing this

1709
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:49,599
towards your setup but this is kind of a

1710
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:52,558
generalized um um aspect or or outlook

1711
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:55,760
on this topic is that people can put too

1712
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,880
many fans and what ends up happening

1713
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,799
let's just say in the idea of fans at

1714
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:03,318
both ends like sometimes people will

1715
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:06,159
have fans you know at both ends pointing

1716
01:08:03,318 --> 01:08:08,159
inwards and we have only air coming in

1717
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:10,879
and no air coming out so it's almost

1718
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:12,879
like this positive pressure idea and

1719
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,519
what ends up happening is the air comes

1720
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,400
in at a high volume but it has nowhere

1721
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:20,798
to go and so inevitably it heats up and

1722
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,278
it becomes hot inside and so like what

1723
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,119
you're talking about with a more

1724
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:25,759
negative pressure idea you have a fan

1725
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:28,000
bringing the air in and maybe there's a

1726
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,439
fan at the other end helping it shuttle

1727
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,560
its way out one of the things that can

1728
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:35,278
happen though is that some fans and and

1729
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,319
and this could be even using the same

1730
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,880
exact fans not all Motors and

1731
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:42,039
manufacturers are perfect and so there

1732
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,880
can be flaws in some of these ideas or

1733
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:46,960
setups and so what I mean by that is

1734
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:50,600
that you could have more air coming in

1735
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,679
than you have coming out and so in some

1736
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,199
cases what I've seen in even commercial

1737
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:57,640
the big fancy green houses is that they

1738
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:59,599
have so much air coming in that it

1739
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,798
actually heats up before it's able to

1740
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,079
travel out and in and in some cases what

1741
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:06,519
I've seen is there's too many

1742
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:09,519
circulation fans on the inside so what

1743
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:11,839
that what that does is it draws more air

1744
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,839
into the greenhouse than it would just

1745
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:17,079
using the exhaust fan so the exhaust

1746
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:19,119
fans are designed to bring in this air

1747
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:21,278
and shoot it out the other side but if

1748
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:24,198
you have circulation fans inside that

1749
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:26,560
are bringing in more air it's almost

1750
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:28,399
like if you were trying to you know put

1751
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,600
a hose in your mouth and drink all the

1752
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:32,479
water you know you you you can't it's

1753
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:35,199
you you end up having water blowing out

1754
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:37,318
your mouth and your cheeks are full and

1755
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,798
it doesn't work and so the same kind of

1756
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:41,199
I don't know if that makes sense but the

1757
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:43,960
same kind of thing happens with the fans

1758
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:46,599
is that you're the circulation and maybe

1759
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,119
the exhaust draw in more than the exit

1760
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:51,199
exit fan can handle and so you're

1761
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,519
basically having air that's sitting

1762
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,039
around in the greenhouse waiting for its

1763
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:59,760
chance to escape and in the time it's

1764
01:09:56,039 --> 01:10:01,880
heated up and so we want to make sure

1765
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,000
and in some cases maybe that's the idea

1766
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:06,239
for some Farms is just to have that

1767
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,800
exhaust fan at one end that's blowing

1768
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:11,959
the air out but what it's doing is it's

1769
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,920
it's uh capturing Air at the other end

1770
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:17,000
and naturally bringing it through the

1771
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:20,079
canopy and out the other side and so I

1772
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,600
would just say that you know more air

1773
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:25,479
movement isn't always better just

1774
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:28,079
because we're in these structures and

1775
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:30,439
there has to be a way you know an even

1776
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,800
in and an even out for all that air and

1777
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:35,000
if we kind of go in between that with

1778
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,640
too many maybe circulation fans or other

1779
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,079
things in some of these setups we could

1780
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:42,199
cause the opposite reaction and so it's

1781
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,039
always just good to be mindful and one

1782
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:46,960
thing that I always say to people is

1783
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:48,840
that it's easier to add more fans if you

1784
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,920
think that you need more if you buy a

1785
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:53,119
bunch of fans and all of a sudden you're

1786
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,480
like well maybe I didn't need this fan

1787
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:57,679
or or this is too many fans I listen to

1788
01:10:55,479 --> 01:11:00,238
the podcast and now I realize I've got

1789
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:02,119
too many fans it's really easier to go

1790
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:03,839
to the store and buy another fan and add

1791
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:05,960
one than it is to sit around with a

1792
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,880
bunch of fans and go okay now they're

1793
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:11,960
going on Facebook Marketplace or the

1794
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:14,719
next garage sale or or whatever and so

1795
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,840
um you know starting out with a little

1796
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,520
bit and adding more is the best way to

1797
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:22,880
go right on so let's talk about about

1798
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,320
too much cool too much cold not enough

1799
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,119
heat now for most of us this isn't

1800
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:29,960
something that we're going to experience

1801
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:32,439
during our the main part of our growing

1802
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:35,239
season it's probably something that is

1803
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:36,479
happening towards the end uh certainly

1804
01:11:35,238 --> 01:11:38,479
there are people who are going to have

1805
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:42,119
cold nights that they need to insulate

1806
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:44,559
from uh in in the country but but for

1807
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:46,119
most people it seems to be the end of

1808
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,080
flowering when they're trying to squeeze

1809
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:52,479
out another week or two but the E the

1810
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:54,760
nights are have dropped below or near 50

1811
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:58,879
and so they're just trying to keep their

1812
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:01,760
their plants awake and the soil awake

1813
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:05,039
um at the same time we don't want to

1814
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,719
close up the greenhouse totally because

1815
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:10,679
this is also mold time of year and we

1816
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:14,039
don't want them to to the plants that

1817
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:17,359
are molding to get other plants also

1818
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:21,359
molding so um what suggestions do you

1819
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:22,759
make for um preserving that air exchange

1820
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,920
so that you can keep the fresh air

1821
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:27,800
coming in um without

1822
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,920
um making the plants too cold there at

1823
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,279
the end of the

1824
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:34,359
season yeah that that's definitely a

1825
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:35,800
tricky or a slippery slope in some cases

1826
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:38,519
depending on where you are it's

1827
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:40,480
different for everybody um one of the

1828
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,360
things that I would also look at you

1829
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:45,919
know going into those times years is is

1830
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:47,799
how I'm irrigating my water schedule you

1831
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,560
know I might actually start to cut back

1832
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,199
on the water a little bit as I know it's

1833
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,600
starting to cool down cuz the plants

1834
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:55,279
aren't going to use as much water as

1835
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,400
they start to cool down if they're

1836
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:59,158
starting to finish it's not a bad idea

1837
01:12:57,399 --> 01:13:02,198
you know even though maybe there's the

1838
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:05,399
idea of flushing um that doesn't go away

1839
01:13:02,198 --> 01:13:08,039
but it uses less water less amounts of

1840
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:10,238
water in order to do that

1841
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:12,840
um you

1842
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:14,718
know bringing in cold air isn't the

1843
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,840
worst thing in the world but it takes a

1844
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,279
little bit of work in these

1845
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,360
do-it-yourself greenh houses because you

1846
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:22,679
know we try to put things on a timer or

1847
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:25,158
something like that but a lot of times

1848
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:27,359
you know we're we're the sensor you know

1849
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:29,439
us as humans are the main sensor and we

1850
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:32,759
go hey it feels warm oh hey it feels

1851
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:35,319
cold we should do this and so again it I

1852
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:37,520
think it's really important to have that

1853
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:39,439
infrared thermometer so you can point

1854
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,639
and shoot and see what your plant temps

1855
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:43,839
are especially your buds and so I would

1856
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:46,400
say that you know as you're getting

1857
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,600
closer to the finishing of the plants

1858
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:50,479
knowing what those flower temperatures

1859
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,079
are and making sure they don't get too

1860
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:54,759
hot in the daytime um and then that

1861
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:56,880
temperature swing in the night gets too

1862
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:59,480
crazy where they get terribly cold and

1863
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,480
so you know what ends up happening

1864
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:03,079
sometimes is it's almost like a air

1865
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:06,599
conditioning condenser you know it

1866
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:09,158
starts to get that you know um on a hot

1867
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,120
day that pipe starts to get Frost built

1868
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:14,279
up on it you know plants are kind of a

1869
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:16,238
condenser in the same regard they don't

1870
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:18,399
necessarily get Frost and freeze around

1871
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:21,119
them or whatever but they get hot and

1872
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:24,559
cold and when they get hot and cold they

1873
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:27,000
expire moisture um or not in some cases

1874
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,639
and so being being able to monitor um

1875
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,880
where the shift or where that change is

1876
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:33,679
and kind of knowing cuz here's the thing

1877
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:36,079
you don't necessarily have to carry this

1878
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:38,239
thing around all the time and monitor

1879
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:40,119
things it's not a bad idea it's not hard

1880
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:42,439
to do but eventually you start to get a

1881
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:45,119
little bit of a a Groove going you know

1882
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:46,839
you kind of get that Jedi mindset with

1883
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,719
the plants and going okay I know what's

1884
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,119
going to happen on a day like today so I

1885
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,920
need to be prepared and maybe close the

1886
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:55,039
greenhouse up a little earlier than I

1887
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:56,679
normally would and that goes for the

1888
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:58,519
opening of the greenhouse maybe I need

1889
01:14:56,679 --> 01:15:02,319
to actually open the greenhouse a little

1890
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:03,600
bit more um on these days and so really

1891
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,039
understanding and looking ahead at the

1892
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,320
weather patterns and then realizing what

1893
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:10,279
the cause and effect is with some of

1894
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:12,679
that weather on those plants in that

1895
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:16,679
greenhouse and really you know the temp

1896
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:18,840
and humidity you know um sensors are

1897
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:20,399
great you know even the basic pool ones

1898
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,840
that you know you hang outside and you

1899
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:23,920
don't have to hook it up to any

1900
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,639
electricity at all are really good for

1901
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,079
telling us the temp and the humidity of

1902
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:29,600
things and then we look at the plant

1903
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:31,880
temp with the laser and we go oh aha

1904
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,400
this is where I'm at so you know if

1905
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:36,600
things get warmer or colder this could

1906
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:39,119
be what happens and so in some cases it

1907
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,199
might be just turning off the fan or it

1908
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:43,039
might be just turning on the fan or it

1909
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:45,519
might be closing the greenhouse like I

1910
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:48,519
said earlier opening it up but I would

1911
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,239
say that it's best to always do one

1912
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,159
little thing at a time rather than

1913
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:55,079
several things because it's really easy

1914
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:57,158
for us to get caught up in how we feel

1915
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:59,238
also and how we feel isn't how the

1916
01:15:57,158 --> 01:16:01,479
plants feel and so you know when we're

1917
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:03,759
walking around in socks and shoes and

1918
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:06,839
hats and gloves and pants and all these

1919
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:08,520
things what we're feeling isn't really

1920
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:11,480
how the plants feel there's not an

1921
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:13,080
Apples to Apples situation going on and

1922
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:15,678
so I always kind of laugh when people go

1923
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:17,399
into a growroom or a greenhouse and go

1924
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,319
oh it's really hot in here oh it's

1925
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:22,439
really this or that and that's true it

1926
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:25,198
is but are the plants experiencing that

1927
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:27,638
same you know feeling or reaction action

1928
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:29,960
that you're getting out of the room um a

1929
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:32,039
lot of times it's not and so that's why

1930
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,319
I say like monitor what the plants is

1931
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:36,639
really doing soil temp is really

1932
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:38,479
important the substrate Temp and knowing

1933
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:40,719
what that is and being able to make sure

1934
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:42,919
that you're not using freezing cold

1935
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,920
water towards the end of that cycle and

1936
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:46,600
and shocking The Roots even more for the

1937
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,600
development of things it might just be

1938
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,960
that we need to heat up the water when

1939
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,120
we irrigate at that time of the year and

1940
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,920
maybe Nothing Else Matters uh but again

1941
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:58,920
you have to monitor all that stuff so

1942
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:02,158
that you can really process everything

1943
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:04,639
to help make that decision of what

1944
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:06,638
direction you're going to go again just

1945
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:08,440
because we read that some guy does it on

1946
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:10,719
the internet does not mean that it makes

1947
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:13,759
it appropriate for where we live and our

1948
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:16,158
goals and and and how our gear is set up

1949
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,239
so always always good to interpret these

1950
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:19,920
things for

1951
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:23,000
ourselves Instagram has not helped the

1952
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,079
commercial farmer one bit I feel like

1953
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,119
all I've seen is people go I saw this

1954
01:17:25,079 --> 01:17:30,600
online and I'm like well that wasn't in

1955
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:32,920
your state your town and your climate or

1956
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,120
any of these things and so you know

1957
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,679
Instagram or social media is a great

1958
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:39,198
place to see you know a lot of times

1959
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,600
people are only showing the good stuff

1960
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:43,559
you know for the most part but at the

1961
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,000
same time there's more to it than the

1962
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,480
picture that we're seeing there's

1963
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,319
usually more to it than even some of the

1964
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:51,678
statements that we read about some of

1965
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:55,039
these techniques and while they're

1966
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:57,239
important to learn and and to know about

1967
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:59,279
people are really quick to apply or jump

1968
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:00,879
you know knee-jerk reaction to hey this

1969
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,840
is what I want to do or hey this is

1970
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,880
where we want to go this direction or

1971
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,920
whatever and in the commercial setting

1972
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,119
at scale it's taken people down the

1973
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:11,158
wrong road and so luckily with the homeg

1974
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:13,399
Growers I think that there's a little

1975
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:15,279
bit more of a you know a little bit more

1976
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:16,679
forgiveness here but still it's it's

1977
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:18,119
money out of our pocket when we're

1978
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:20,719
trying to grow and do these things

1979
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:24,238
whether we're at scale or we're at home

1980
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,800
and so um you know like I said The more

1981
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:27,559
things that we can kind of Monitor and

1982
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,360
keep an eye on the better we have

1983
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:33,840
chances of making the right pivot at the

1984
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:35,719
right time uh but again you know I would

1985
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,159
take what you learn on social media

1986
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:39,000
sometimes especially when it's just a

1987
01:18:37,158 --> 01:18:41,279
picture and a quick statement with a

1988
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,800
grain of salt because there's way more

1989
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:47,679
to those stories than um what's being

1990
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,880
told totally all right so the last area

1991
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:54,199
I want to Ping on here before we wrap up

1992
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:55,440
set two is um is insect pests because

1993
01:18:54,198 --> 01:18:56,960
we're you know once you have a

1994
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:01,119
greenhouse you kind of have you're kind

1995
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:03,480
of a host for a war right we we've got

1996
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:06,319
all of the naturally occurring

1997
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:09,279
beneficial insects that are just in

1998
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:11,719
nature and if we've got a grassy floor

1999
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:14,039
certainly they are in um the greenhouse

2000
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:18,119
and we've got a bunch of plants so they

2001
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:22,238
are attracting uh beneficial um

2002
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:24,238
Predators as well and then if we are um

2003
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:27,079
you know choosing to also do order

2004
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,839
benefit IAL insects online from somebody

2005
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:31,639
like you know natural enemies or

2006
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:34,520
something we're adding those to it and

2007
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:36,359
so now we've got um whatever pest

2008
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,159
pressure that we have in the natural

2009
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:41,319
environment plus all the good guys in

2010
01:19:39,158 --> 01:19:44,759
the natural environment and anything

2011
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:48,719
that we've added and now they're all

2012
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:52,719
within um you know these walls and it's

2013
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:57,039
like a cage match so um what has your

2014
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:59,158
experience been as far as um pest

2015
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:03,079
pressure being worse in a

2016
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:05,920
greenhouse and also Pest

2017
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:07,519
Solutions being potentially easier in a

2018
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,399
greenhouse I mean how how does this play

2019
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,800
out differently in a greenhouse and what

2020
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:13,039
are your

2021
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,639
recommendations well it's it's funny

2022
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:17,079
like you brought up a couple funny

2023
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:20,239
points of the yeah I mean it's it can be

2024
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:22,920
an ongoing battle and it's definitely

2025
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:25,079
something to be noteworthy of and so I

2026
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,359
would say that you know one of the best

2027
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:30,238
environments for green for a pest is in

2028
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:32,039
a greenhouse I mean pest will really

2029
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,399
take off in a greenhouse just because

2030
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:36,158
it's the warmer spot than anywhere else

2031
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:40,238
on the property a lot of times and so

2032
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:42,679
it's another reason that well let me say

2033
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:45,319
this too is that a lot of people come

2034
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:48,000
from the idea of controlled environment

2035
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:49,799
agriculture or controlled environment

2036
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,520
period they just say that word all the

2037
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,800
time oh a greenhouse is a little more

2038
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,600
controlled environment and we hear that

2039
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:58,159
term a lot and so to be honest I mean

2040
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,800
even some of the most sophisticated

2041
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:04,000
greenh houses out there state-of-the-art

2042
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,800
are really hard to control um on one

2043
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
hand it's just because some of the Bell

2044
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:10,719
there's too many bells and whistles and

2045
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,679
some in some cases there's not enough

2046
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,480
Talent or people that know how to dial

2047
01:21:12,679 --> 01:21:17,239
all this stuff in I mean cannabis has

2048
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:20,839
taken green houses further than any you

2049
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:22,359
know a greenh hous is ever gone and so

2050
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:24,119
are there people out there that know how

2051
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:26,039
to dial these things in and make them

2052
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:27,800
work right right there's far and few

2053
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:30,479
between it's really difficult out there

2054
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,320
and so it's really better if people you

2055
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:36,319
know look at things at a more practical

2056
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:39,158
aspect but that's a different story um

2057
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:41,719
with with my way of looking at things I

2058
01:21:39,158 --> 01:21:43,399
want to create support and so instead of

2059
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:45,158
controlled environment I want to have a

2060
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:47,158
supportive environment and so a lot of

2061
01:21:45,158 --> 01:21:50,238
the stuff that we talked about is

2062
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:53,559
already in that alignment of supporting

2063
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:56,519
things you know naturally how can we um

2064
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:59,520
help the plants and benefit um growing

2065
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:01,760
them easier and and without all these

2066
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,360
problems and and without all these bells

2067
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,440
and whistles so that's why I always say

2068
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,719
you know use the word support as much as

2069
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:10,759
possible and so when it comes to um the

2070
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:13,439
green houses and this pest issue that

2071
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,679
comes up it definitely really can be an

2072
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:17,000
issue because I've been to a lot of

2073
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:20,079
green houses that do get really hot and

2074
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,439
have you know adverse effects and the

2075
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:24,119
pests really proliferate and do well in

2076
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:27,079
some of these green houses and

2077
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:28,960
especially these hot zones and so the

2078
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:30,960
first order of business would be you

2079
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,480
know knowing where your plants come from

2080
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,840
so I mean if you're starting them from

2081
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:37,359
seed at your own house that's great you

2082
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,880
have a lot more control over it than

2083
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:41,719
than um if you were maybe bringing in

2084
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:44,279
clones from somewhere else if you are

2085
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:45,520
bringing in clones from somewhere else

2086
01:22:44,279 --> 01:22:47,238
you really need to make sure that

2087
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,080
they're clean and how do you do that

2088
01:22:47,238 --> 01:22:51,638
well you can take the jeweler's Loop the

2089
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:53,760
microscopes and really look the plants

2090
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:55,319
over from the leaves and the underside

2091
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,159
and things like that to determine if

2092
01:22:55,319 --> 01:22:59,399
there's anything on them or wrong with

2093
01:22:57,158 --> 01:23:02,238
them um and then the other thing would

2094
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:05,158
be to you know work on a a program of

2095
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:06,919
keeping them clean maybe if you did buy

2096
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:09,359
clones and they're not clean then that

2097
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:11,000
program of of dipping them before you

2098
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,479
plant them or making sure that you're

2099
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,279
using some type of Pest Management right

2100
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:20,879
off the bat so that you know you don't

2101
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:23,840
wait until the they they uh become you

2102
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,400
know more infested so get trying to nip

2103
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,199
it in the butt is soon as possible is

2104
01:23:25,399 --> 01:23:29,039
really the key and that goes for the mom

2105
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:31,399
plants if you're making your own cuting

2106
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:33,439
off your own moms you want to make sure

2107
01:23:31,399 --> 01:23:35,079
that your moms are as clean as possible

2108
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,119
so that you start out as clean as

2109
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:38,760
possible and then as you go into the

2110
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:40,359
greenhouse yeah like you said if you

2111
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,119
have a grass floor or wearing these

2112
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:45,559
green houses with these open doors and

2113
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:48,000
sidewalls and things like that sure bugs

2114
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,760
can fly come flying in I hear that a lot

2115
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,880
of times when I've talked over the years

2116
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,480
about opening the door or rolling up a

2117
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,480
sidewall in a greenhouse it's like well

2118
01:23:53,479 --> 01:23:58,879
the bugs can come in and and that's

2119
01:23:55,479 --> 01:24:00,479
definitely true they can I mean from

2120
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,359
what we've learned and seen over the

2121
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:05,879
years the bugs really you know try to

2122
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:08,119
find the weakest plant in in the in the

2123
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,880
population and so you know plants that

2124
01:24:08,119 --> 01:24:12,559
are not as healthy as other plants

2125
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:15,119
typically will get the bugs first some

2126
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,120
people will even say oh you know I grow

2127
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:19,238
these three different cultivars in my

2128
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:21,960
Greenhouse but they only want to go to

2129
01:24:19,238 --> 01:24:23,879
the you know the gelato or something

2130
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:27,520
they they like the turps of the gelato

2131
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:29,600
more than like the OG or the The Lemon

2132
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,520
Cherry gelato or something whatever you

2133
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,960
know and so that might seem like the

2134
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:37,239
case but it's not totally the case most

2135
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,399
of the time it has to do with and and

2136
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:41,039
again plants can seem and look really

2137
01:24:39,399 --> 01:24:43,039
healthy but when they have this bug

2138
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,359
infestation that's the first sign that

2139
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:46,920
there is something wrong with the health

2140
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,559
of the plant and why aren't they going

2141
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,158
to the other plants well the other

2142
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,000
plants are a little bit stronger and

2143
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:54,839
more resistant to those bugs and they

2144
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,840
found that this strain or this

2145
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:59,800
particular plant in the greenhouse is

2146
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:01,920
weaker than the rest and that maybe is

2147
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,920
because of the N nutritional demands and

2148
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:07,639
the way that the substrate and things

2149
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:10,600
were made up maybe we mixed up a pot and

2150
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:12,079
it it was the last of our bag of soil in

2151
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,760
our amendments and we kind of just

2152
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:17,439
didn't give that last little plant

2153
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,400
everything that everybody else got and

2154
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:21,319
so we now know that it's getting all the

2155
01:25:19,399 --> 01:25:23,519
bugs because it just didn't meet the

2156
01:25:21,319 --> 01:25:24,639
health demands of the nutrition and

2157
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,000
everything that it was put put up

2158
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:29,359
against um the other thing is that

2159
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,639
inside the green houses we always want

2160
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:33,359
to start scouting in the corners because

2161
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:34,880
the corners are typically warmer than

2162
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:37,238
the center of the greenhouse when the

2163
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,520
sun comes up in the morning it's usually

2164
01:25:37,238 --> 01:25:42,319
directed to one end of the greenhouse or

2165
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:44,840
side and then as the sun goes down the

2166
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:46,519
same thing and so uh typically you

2167
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,840
always want to look on the outskirts or

2168
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,040
the ends of the green houses for the

2169
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,400
first

2170
01:25:50,039 --> 01:25:54,800
infestations um and and that will tell

2171
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:57,319
you a lot as well and so again we're

2172
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,480
trying to avoid an infestation and so

2173
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:02,679
the program that you set up from the

2174
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:04,759
early time is really important to have

2175
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:07,199
and the the main part of that program I

2176
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:09,000
would say is scouting um I know that a

2177
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:10,879
lot of people's first line of defense is

2178
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,238
just hey I just spray my plants every

2179
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:17,279
couple days no matter if I have bugs or

2180
01:26:13,238 --> 01:26:19,439
not and you know that method is okay but

2181
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:22,238
it it's not the best for the plants and

2182
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:24,319
the expressions of the flowers and it

2183
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:25,839
can be hard on the plants to spray them

2184
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:28,319
all the time with even Organic

2185
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,840
pesticides they don't love it but they

2186
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:32,479
also don't necessarily hate it a

2187
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,239
tremendous amount but if we're trying to

2188
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,519
grow quality

2189
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:39,000
medicine and trying to keep the plant

2190
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:40,840
moving forward every time we spray the

2191
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,158
plants with those oils it is a little

2192
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:46,440
bit of a setback uh for the plant itself

2193
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:48,599
and so scouting with the jeweler's Loop

2194
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:51,719
and just really being able to identify

2195
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,719
where the pests are how bad it is maybe

2196
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:56,600
gives you the ability to spot spray

2197
01:26:53,719 --> 01:26:59,279
rather than entirely covering um every

2198
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,719
plant and soaking everything down and so

2199
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:04,279
identifying uh the hot spots or where

2200
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:06,039
these things are which pests they are

2201
01:27:04,279 --> 01:27:08,439
and knowing the life cycle of these

2202
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:10,519
pests there are times where we don't

2203
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:13,238
spray enough maybe we're spraying every

2204
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:14,960
seven days or something like that maybe

2205
01:27:13,238 --> 01:27:17,359
that's just the idea that someone has

2206
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,359
hey I spray every seven days well in

2207
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:21,639
between that time how many eggs have

2208
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:24,960
hatched and how many aphids even maybe

2209
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:27,159
have proliferated in that amount of time

2210
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,880
um it can be quite a bit and so you're

2211
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:31,158
actually just kicking the can down the

2212
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,279
road and so I I think that you brought

2213
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:36,158
up a good company natural enemies and

2214
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:38,359
copert they really have a lot of cool

2215
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:41,158
stuff as far as pocket guides and

2216
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:43,519
Jewelers loops and books on these pests

2217
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:45,399
and and you know posters that you can

2218
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,800
hang in your garage or in your growroom

2219
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:50,599
that help you know kind of keep you on

2220
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:53,079
your toes for all this pest stuff and so

2221
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:55,119
um if you're not scouting and using a

2222
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:57,000
Jeweler's Loop and taking off leaves and

2223
01:27:55,118 --> 01:28:00,439
looking at the underside of them quite

2224
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,560
often um I would say that you know when

2225
01:28:00,439 --> 01:28:04,519
an infestation does pick up I wouldn't

2226
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:08,119
be surprised because you can actually

2227
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:10,520
find this stuff um pretty easy before

2228
01:28:08,118 --> 01:28:12,519
things start to get out of hand and so

2229
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:14,440
going in and you know de leafing the

2230
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:16,159
plants a little bit before you spray so

2231
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:18,039
that you get rid of some of those pests

2232
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:20,238
and I would say that when you de Leaf

2233
01:28:18,039 --> 01:28:23,479
your plants you always want to have a

2234
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:26,559
plastic garbage bag or a some type of a

2235
01:28:23,479 --> 01:28:28,799
garbage bag with you so you're not just

2236
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,199
throwing those leaves on the ground I

2237
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,639
know that it's been common practice even

2238
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:34,879
for me and I've seen it in the

2239
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,880
commercial level where when they go de

2240
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,639
Leaf Everybody Just DE Leafs as fast as

2241
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:41,000
they can and all the the leaves are

2242
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:42,760
hitting the floor and on the pots and

2243
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,800
then we come back later and we you know

2244
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:46,639
maybe sweep it all up or rake it all up

2245
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,039
and then throw it into the garbage bag

2246
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:51,159
and what happens is the pests start to

2247
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:53,399
move around quite a bit and you're not

2248
01:28:51,158 --> 01:28:55,638
actually getting rid of them and so by

2249
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:57,920
De leafing the plants that maybe have

2250
01:28:55,639 --> 01:28:59,560
some bugs on them we're getting rid of

2251
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,520
quite a few bugs because that's where

2252
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:03,600
they reside as the underside of the leav

2253
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,639
so you can imagine yourself throwing

2254
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,239
away hundreds of pests by Just DE

2255
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:11,159
leafing and then going in and doing that

2256
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:13,919
the spray that needs to be done and some

2257
01:29:11,158 --> 01:29:16,879
of the products I like to use is aagard

2258
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:19,920
which is an aid duratin I'm not a as

2259
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:23,639
much of a fan of the AA Max as I am the

2260
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:25,279
aagard um but the aid duratin um another

2261
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:27,960
product that I like to use is called

2262
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:31,158
suffoil X and there's a similar product

2263
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:33,560
to suffoil X called trch they're both

2264
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:35,679
80% mineral oil one's more expensive

2265
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:38,719
than the other I happen to just think

2266
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:40,920
and notice that suff oil X seems to be a

2267
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:43,158
a a better product at the end of the day

2268
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,719
but if you need to save a couple bucks

2269
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:48,079
and go with the trch that's okay and I

2270
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:51,198
would say that mixing the trch and the

2271
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:54,840
aagard together can be a powerful combo

2272
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:57,399
in fighting spider mites and uh aphids

2273
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,000
um when it comes to things like thrips

2274
01:29:57,399 --> 01:30:00,719
like I was saying earlier understanding

2275
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,359
the life cycle is really important

2276
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:05,319
because the thrips also um have one of

2277
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:08,639
the stages of life down in the soil or

2278
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:10,479
the substrate and so we can spray all

2279
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,319
the thrips we want but if we don't treat

2280
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:15,118
the soil they're never going to go away

2281
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:17,880
and so getting uh nematodes like the

2282
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:20,960
steinera faler if I said that right

2283
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:23,480
sorry if I botched it um is a good

2284
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:26,239
nematode to put into the soil to help

2285
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:28,559
get rid of thrips or even maybe avoid

2286
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:31,439
getting some of those thrips um in the

2287
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:33,360
long run and so you know being a homeg

2288
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:35,279
grower sometimes people don't want to

2289
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:37,559
know all these different ins and outs

2290
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:39,960
and details and things but unfortunately

2291
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,840
it's a really important aspect to to

2292
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,198
learn and to understand and once you get

2293
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,279
the hang of it and read about it a

2294
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:47,279
little bit and know the common pests

2295
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:49,079
that you have and what to do about them

2296
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:52,079
it isn't that hard to deal with but

2297
01:30:49,079 --> 01:30:54,238
again um if you don't know things can

2298
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:56,399
creep up and by the time they creep up

2299
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:58,479
and start to do their thing it could be

2300
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:00,399
way later in flower too and that's just

2301
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:03,638
a tough time to have to spray and to

2302
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:05,638
begin battling pests and so the more we

2303
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:08,400
can do the moms the clones and while

2304
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:11,279
they're in veg and even the earliest um

2305
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:13,839
weeks of flowering will help ensure that

2306
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:16,519
we have a great finish to the to the end

2307
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:20,360
of the cycle damn that's so well put so

2308
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:22,920
many everybody's interested in um crisis

2309
01:31:20,359 --> 01:31:25,639
management for their pests when really

2310
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,960
the easy solution is on the prevention

2311
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:30,679
side so it doesn't happen in the first

2312
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,600
place so um all right so let's go ahead

2313
01:31:30,679 --> 01:31:34,319
and take our second commercial and be

2314
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:36,600
right back um you are listening to

2315
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:39,920
shaping fire and my guest today is OG

2316
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,920
Greenhouse consultant Eric

2317
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:45,639
Branstad fish poop brand fertilizer is

2318
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:47,960
an allnatural fish poop concentrate with

2319
01:31:45,639 --> 01:31:50,639
nothing added real fish poop is

2320
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:52,600
extraordinarily complex not only are you

2321
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,239
adding the nitrogen phosphorus and

2322
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:56,079
pottassium your plants need to build

2323
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:58,879
mass transport nutrients and enhance

2324
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:01,198
flavor but fish waste is also packed

2325
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,760
with biological activity and

2326
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:05,960
micronutrients when you add fish poop to

2327
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:08,560
your irrigation water you are adding

2328
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:11,198
life force probiotics and active

2329
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:13,480
microbes these microorganisms include a

2330
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:15,118
wealth of various bacteria and protozoa

2331
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:17,919
which further enhance nutrient

2332
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:20,238
availability for the plants because

2333
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,520
plants are limited by the absence of any

2334
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:24,118
essential micronutrient these Trace

2335
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:26,040
nutrients are the difference between

2336
01:32:24,118 --> 01:32:27,679
having a decent garden and having a

2337
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:30,719

2340
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:36,800
cracks in your fertilizer program to

2341
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,760

Shango Los and my guest today is OG

2428
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:56,600
Greenhouse consultant Eric BR stad so

2429
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,359
here's our big finish uh during the

2430
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,920
first set we figured out where we were

2431
01:35:58,359 --> 01:36:01,920
going to put the greenhouse and how we

2432
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,719
were going to put the greenhouse during

2433
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,480
set two we figured out how the hell

2434
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:07,560
we're going to deal with heat and cold

2435
01:36:05,479 --> 01:36:08,839
and pests and here in set three we're

2436
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:11,400
going to talk a little bit about

2437
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:14,719
tricking out our greenhouse and proper

2438
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:17,319
care so um Eric you know you've been on

2439
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:19,960
this show before and um we have talked

2440
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:22,519
at length about um light deprivation

2441
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:24,319
light dep and um I should probably know

2442
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:26,040
the episode number but but for anybody

2443
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:28,799
who wants to listen to that episode you

2444
01:36:26,039 --> 01:36:31,800
can look for it on um I'll put the link

2445
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,679
on the on the page for this episode but

2446
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:35,880
why don't you explain just just real

2447
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:38,158
quick what light de is for folks who are

2448
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:40,000
not familiar with it for their home

2449
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:42,960
greenhouse and they can go to that

2450
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,319
episode if they want to learn more yeah

2451
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:48,239
sure I mean cannabis is a photo period

2452
01:36:45,319 --> 01:36:50,679
plant and what we mean by that is that

2453
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:53,839
it uses these light cycles in order to

2454
01:36:50,679 --> 01:36:55,679
grow or to flower and so most people are

2455
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:58,319
familiar with indoor growing and the

2456
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:01,840
fact that 18 hours of light makes the

2457
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:03,920
plants veg or grow and then when you cut

2458
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,679
that light back to just 12 hours of

2459
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,920
light they will start to produce the

2460
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:11,319
flowers and so when we want to do that

2461
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:14,800
same technique outside we can't turn on

2462
01:37:11,319 --> 01:37:17,719
and off the Sun but we can put a tarp

2463
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:21,079
over the greenhouse that makes it uh

2464
01:37:17,719 --> 01:37:23,520
that puts that Greenhouse in the dark so

2465
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:26,039
basically we are using um a green

2466
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:29,199
Greenhouse with light depth curtains or

2467
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:31,600
tarps that create that photo period so

2468
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:36,118
we have full control of when they've

2469
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:38,480
flower and when they veg um using the

2470
01:37:36,118 --> 01:37:41,000
sunlight uh that is great dude you know

2471
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:42,959
what I just realized I just looked up

2472
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,800
while you were saying that the episode

2473
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:47,319
that you were on talking about Le light

2474
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:50,239
de uh you and I are recording

2475
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:54,238
episode9 right now we did that episode

2476
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:58,718
episode 13 holy mackerel that was a bit

2477
01:37:54,238 --> 01:38:00,559
13 wow that was 8 years ago wow wow well

2478
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:02,840
it's still a good one it's just still a

2479
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:05,400
good one so so yeah thank you for that

2480
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:08,199
definition and um dear listener if you

2481
01:38:05,399 --> 01:38:10,118
want to hear a really good hour and a

2482
01:38:08,198 --> 01:38:14,079
half about how to do this in detail go

2483
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:16,880
on back to episode 13 and uh listen to

2484
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:16,880
Eric and I as

2485
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:23,238
youngans all right so so so that's

2486
01:38:21,238 --> 01:38:26,079
that's a quick little plug for light dep

2487
01:38:23,238 --> 01:38:28,839
because if if if you are trying to be

2488
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:30,800
self-sufficient um with your cannabis

2489
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,639
and and you want to be able to maybe get

2490
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:35,279
in two cycles during your summer light

2491
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:36,960
dep is a great way to do it yeah so that

2492
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:40,198
gives light dep a short shrift but

2493
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:41,719
that's it we're moving on so uh so um

2494
01:38:40,198 --> 01:38:47,158
one of the things that I personally

2495
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:51,880
really enjoyed was um adding some Wii

2496
01:38:47,158 --> 01:38:55,238
environmental um uh um gauges to the

2497
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:57,760
tent outside and it just as close enough

2498
01:38:55,238 --> 01:38:59,319
to the house Wi-Fi to pick it up which

2499
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:02,360
means that it can then throw it to my

2500
01:38:59,319 --> 01:39:04,039
phone so I can be anywhere in the world

2501
01:39:02,359 --> 01:39:06,839
and know what's going on in my

2502
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:11,279
Greenhouse um because you know mostly I

2503
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:13,279
grow food here and um you know food and

2504
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:15,840
cannabis are all very temperature and

2505
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:17,960
moisture dependent and and if I'm if I

2506
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:21,360
can set my alarms and and they can like

2507
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:23,679
bring me bring me on in um to you know

2508
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:26,759
to tell me that I need to check on on

2509
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:29,199
the greenhouse um gr granted at the at

2510
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,719
the homeg grower level um Outdoors

2511
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:34,439
there's not usually a lot of integration

2512
01:39:31,719 --> 01:39:36,319
of these sorts of products but um my

2513
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:39,000
gosh they're really helpful if you

2514
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:40,439
bother to you know spend a little coin

2515
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,198
and get

2516
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:44,879
them totally I mean it's not out of the

2517
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:48,598
question and there's a lot more out

2518
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:51,118
there than there used to be I mean um

2519
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:52,960
there's there's little companies that

2520
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:54,960
people barely know exist that have you

2521
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,279
know some of this technology going on

2522
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:59,000
and so getting a couple sensors in the

2523
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:01,800
greenhouse that can be hooked up to your

2524
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,599
phone just to know what's going on

2525
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,239
sometimes and you know the pivotal parts

2526
01:40:03,599 --> 01:40:06,920
of the Year might be in the spring and

2527
01:40:05,238 --> 01:40:08,479
the fall when the seasons are starting

2528
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:11,800
to change and you really want to know

2529
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:14,559
what's going on so that you can prepare

2530
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:17,239
uh to make some changes or prepare to go

2531
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:19,000
home and do something about this and so

2532
01:40:17,238 --> 01:40:21,158
you know while it's like you were saying

2533
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,639
it's not 100% needed and it's not going

2534
01:40:21,158 --> 01:40:25,439
to always do everything that maybe an

2535
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:27,599
automated Greenhouse is going to do it

2536
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:30,158
does give you an edge and having that

2537
01:40:27,599 --> 01:40:31,599
slight Edge is always you know a step

2538
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:34,519
forward in the right

2539
01:40:31,599 --> 01:40:36,840
direction to be able to you know rescue

2540
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:39,840
your own crop or enhance the quality of

2541
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:41,480
that crop you know the a lot of times um

2542
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,119
with the way the weather is these days

2543
01:40:41,479 --> 01:40:44,839
things can change pretty quick and it

2544
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:46,598
might be where you're away from home and

2545
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:48,440
you need someone to go back and close it

2546
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:50,800
up because all of a sudden it got cold I

2547
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:52,598
mean we've had crazy weather where it's

2548
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,719
sunny one day and the next day all of a

2549
01:40:52,599 --> 01:40:57,480
sudden we get a snowstorm or something

2550
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:59,158
you know and nobody knows and sees this

2551
01:40:57,479 --> 01:41:01,359
stuff coming even though we look at the

2552
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:03,118
weather and you know the weatherman says

2553
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:05,839
it's going to be great they're not

2554
01:41:03,118 --> 01:41:07,639
always right and so it's really good to

2555
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,719
be able to notice some of these things

2556
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:11,880
and and stay ahead of the curve a little

2557
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:14,079
bit um another thing that can be you

2558
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:15,840
know cool and important to have is that

2559
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:18,679
you know some of these things can be

2560
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,520
hooked up to even a selenoid that turns

2561
01:41:18,679 --> 01:41:22,560
on and off your irrigation so there

2562
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:25,080
might be just a simple hey I want to be

2563
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:27,599
able to turn on and off my water when

2564
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:29,599
I'm gone from home and that's not out of

2565
01:41:27,599 --> 01:41:31,480
the question because you know a lot of

2566
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:35,079
the Landscaping stuff that we use

2567
01:41:31,479 --> 01:41:36,919
nowadays for our homes um can be

2568
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:40,279
outfitted to do that and so you know

2569
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:42,399
Rainbird is a common company or term

2570
01:41:40,279 --> 01:41:45,439
that have all sorts of

2571
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:48,198
landscaping uh devices that can be

2572
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:49,839
remote or you know controlled just you

2573
01:41:48,198 --> 01:41:52,678
know right at your house type of thing

2574
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:54,560
with with a couple buttons or um even a

2575
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:56,199
timer on on there that you know allows

2576
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,440
you to be able to control when stuff

2577
01:41:56,198 --> 01:42:01,198
gets water or maybe when a fan turns on

2578
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:03,000
or not um you know simply hooking stuff

2579
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:05,479
up to a timer because you know when you

2580
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,679
want something to come on or turn off uh

2581
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:10,279
can be an important way to do things but

2582
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,158
it never hurts to you know if you can

2583
01:42:10,279 --> 01:42:14,920
throw in a little technology in there

2584
01:42:12,158 --> 01:42:16,879
and and see if it helps you um I like

2585
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:18,920
your point too about you know you only

2586
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:21,599
need to go into this as far as you need

2587
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:23,880
to um I grow different types of plants

2588
01:42:21,599 --> 01:42:27,039
right I've got my I've got my my food

2589
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:28,679
plants which are mostly ungreen housed

2590
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:30,279
but the but the ones that are greenh

2591
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:31,639
housed I just need something really

2592
01:42:30,279 --> 01:42:34,399
simple to know what the temperature and

2593
01:42:31,639 --> 01:42:36,520
the humidity is and I've got like just a

2594
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:38,079
simple like little goie smart

2595
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:40,520
temperature thing right it cost me like

2596
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:43,599
25 bucks nothing to it but like but with

2597
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:45,599
my cannabis I'm I take that very much

2598
01:42:43,599 --> 01:42:48,360
Ser more serious for obvious reasons

2599
01:42:45,599 --> 01:42:50,480
right um I I want I want to know you

2600
01:42:48,359 --> 01:42:52,639
know uh I want to know you know heat and

2601
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:54,519
humidity and vapor and like all this

2602
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:57,639
more detailed stuff and I want to be

2603
01:42:54,520 --> 01:43:00,679
able to look at uh charts and graphs of

2604
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:03,079
it and so for my cannabis uh Greenhouse

2605
01:43:00,679 --> 01:43:05,920
well I like I've upload I've upgraded to

2606
01:43:03,079 --> 01:43:08,158
like a pulse system right and so so now

2607
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,079
I've got all the details plus as you

2608
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:11,679
were saying I haven't gone so far as to

2609
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:13,599
like connect it to my drip irrigation

2610
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,840
which would be dope but like whenever I

2611
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:18,880
want to I could like expand my pulse

2612
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:20,920
meter um into controlling all of my

2613
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:23,960
stuff you know and and it's great you

2614
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:26,039
can just take these steps one at a time

2615
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:27,000
from season to season depending on what

2616
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:29,679
you can

2617
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,238
afford I agree like I said earlier and

2618
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:33,239
you're kind of hitting that same nail on

2619
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:35,198
the head is that you start out simple

2620
01:43:33,238 --> 01:43:37,319
and with what you can afford and what

2621
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:40,399
seems reasonable and always have that

2622
01:43:37,319 --> 01:43:42,880
ability to expand and the expanding can

2623
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:45,399
be adding another light adding another

2624
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:48,079
fan or adding something to that control

2625
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:50,000
system which might be okay I've been

2626
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:51,439
reading and collecting all this data now

2627
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,439
I'm going to add something where I can

2628
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:56,319
turn it on and off myself or something

2629
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:58,759
like that so I mean there are especially

2630
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:01,920
with that pulse and um a couple other

2631
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:04,960
systems the ability to phase this so

2632
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,440
phase one's simple phase two might be um

2633
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:08,480
getting you know once you get your feet

2634
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:10,039
wet in the growing season you want to

2635
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:14,198
you know you can take more on we have

2636
01:44:10,039 --> 01:44:15,920
more bandwidth even for stuff and so um

2637
01:44:14,198 --> 01:44:18,238
I always try to like I said recommend

2638
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:20,239
starting out slow do what you can within

2639
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:22,198
your own bandwidth and then after that

2640
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:25,519
season look at what the upgrades might

2641
01:44:22,198 --> 01:44:27,759
look like yep all right so we were

2642
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:30,800
talking about upgrades and upgrades

2643
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:34,039
around Tech um let's talk about adding

2644
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:36,639
lights to extend the growing season now

2645
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:38,960
I think that adding lights to um an

2646
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:42,039
indoor space is an obvious thing and to

2647
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:44,359
to a greenhouse is generally a good idea

2648
01:44:42,039 --> 01:44:46,560
though I'm not a big fan of of uh the

2649
01:44:44,359 --> 01:44:48,519
light pollution that comes from people

2650
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:52,239
who run their lights all night but you

2651
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:53,800
know that's a personal thing um but um I

2652
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,039
have more concern conc ER when we're

2653
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,400
talking about these small hobby green

2654
01:44:56,039 --> 01:45:00,399
houses of hanging lights in them

2655
01:44:58,399 --> 01:45:03,079
primarily for two reasons number one

2656
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:05,079
lights are heavy and the the internal

2657
01:45:03,079 --> 01:45:07,800
frames of these green houses even the

2658
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:10,960
galvanized steel ones they they wiggle

2659
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:13,079
and I I'm kind of not so sure about that

2660
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:15,840
and then second the lights themselves

2661
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:18,399
can generate heat and potentially um

2662
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:20,079
melt the plastic just because again

2663
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:23,719
we're not working with a lot of space

2664
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:26,198
here so um you know I I I have seen

2665
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:29,279
people do it I've seen them do it well

2666
01:45:26,198 --> 01:45:32,238
um it takes their height from like 66 to

2667
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:34,000
more like 510 which is light I space I

2668
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:36,279
wouldn't really want to give up but what

2669
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,079
are your thoughts on adding lights to to

2670
01:45:36,279 --> 01:45:40,439
you know a greenhouse that's this

2671
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:41,880
small yeah it can be tricky all those

2672
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:44,839
things that you said are definitely

2673
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:46,560
noteworthy and each you know Hobby House

2674
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,920
is a little different and so you can't

2675
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,280
just you know I mean I we can imagine

2676
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:52,118
we're going to hang lights and something

2677
01:45:50,279 --> 01:45:54,118
and then we put it up and we run into

2678
01:45:52,118 --> 01:45:57,158
some of these you know it's one step

2679
01:45:54,118 --> 01:46:00,559
backwards type of thing yeah yeah and so

2680
01:45:57,158 --> 01:46:04,879
um you know I've seen where people have

2681
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:07,679
taken and and basically taken a 4x4 post

2682
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:11,039
and and augured or put that into the

2683
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:14,840
ground it at Four Corners or even just

2684
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:17,679
one at both ends and they actually run

2685
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:19,480
um a cable or a pole of some kind and

2686
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:21,359
they actually hang the lights from that

2687
01:46:19,479 --> 01:46:23,919
so it's not attached to the

2688
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:26,559
greenhouse um this came came up years

2689
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:29,760
ago because when they started doing

2690
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:32,639
proposition 64 in California and rolling

2691
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:35,599
out the ordinances for how people could

2692
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:37,199
grow they were kind of weird with the

2693
01:46:35,599 --> 01:46:39,840
hoop houses they you know you either

2694
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:42,399
were a permitted greenhouse and uh

2695
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:45,239
commercially growing or you know because

2696
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:47,359
an egg you can grow with a non-exempt or

2697
01:46:45,238 --> 01:46:50,039
you know a non-permitted greenhouse and

2698
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:52,519
so um cannabis Farmers wanted to have

2699
01:46:50,039 --> 01:46:54,880
that same opportunity but the ordinances

2700
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:56,520
were hey you got to have a permit or or

2701
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,840
nothing and what they did is they said

2702
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:01,440
well if you okay if you want to have a

2703
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:03,279
exempt Greenhouse that isn't permitted

2704
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:06,238
it can't have any electricity or

2705
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:08,319
lighting fastened to it fans or any of

2706
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:11,519
that so then what people started doing

2707
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:14,519
was rigging up with you know 4x4 posts

2708
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:16,239
and internal framing so that they could

2709
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,719
hang their fans and hang their lights

2710
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:21,759
but it wasn't attached to the greenhouse

2711
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:24,679
yeah yeah to totally outside the spirit

2712
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:28,960
of the rules but exactly how we cannbis

2713
01:47:24,679 --> 01:47:31,520
people interpret rules exactly we find a

2714
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:33,880
way and you know when you go to Home

2715
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:36,800
Depot these days and so when we're

2716
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:38,560
talking about lights you know a deeper

2717
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:40,679
dive would be what kind of light what

2718
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:43,239
color what intensity and all these other

2719
01:47:40,679 --> 01:47:44,920
things and so the short side of that or

2720
01:47:43,238 --> 01:47:47,000
the easier way to look at it might be

2721
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,960
that hey I'm just trying to veg my

2722
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,520
plants a little longer or hey I'm trying

2723
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,920
to you know flower them sooner or

2724
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:56,119
whatever the case is and so you know you

2725
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,800
can get away with fairly low powered

2726
01:47:56,118 --> 01:48:01,198
lights in order to keep a plant in one

2727
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:02,679
stage or another it doesn't necessarily

2728
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:04,960
mean that they're going to grow bigger

2729
01:48:02,679 --> 01:48:06,520
and faster and produce bigger buds but

2730
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:08,399
it's definitely going to help keep the

2731
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:12,199
cycle that you're

2732
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:13,439
intending um streamlined for a certain

2733
01:48:12,198 --> 01:48:15,759
amount of time and that's where the

2734
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:17,678
lights could come in handy and so you

2735
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:19,159
might say you know and people have done

2736
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:22,199
this even on the commercial side where

2737
01:48:19,158 --> 01:48:23,638
they go to Home Depot and they sell the

2738
01:48:22,198 --> 01:48:26,638
decorative

2739
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:28,599
uh uh outdoor patio lights so it's

2740
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:31,039
basically like a long extension cord

2741
01:48:28,599 --> 01:48:32,360
with some light bulbs hanging on it and

2742
01:48:31,039 --> 01:48:35,880
most people would put that in their

2743
01:48:32,359 --> 01:48:37,960
patio or their backyard for um you know

2744
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:39,760
barbecuing and and hanging out and

2745
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:42,079
making more of an Ambiance or whatever

2746
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:43,679
and so these same you know 40ft string

2747
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:47,000
of lights that they have in a box at

2748
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:49,599
Home Depot can be strung up inside these

2749
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,520
green houses maybe even without any

2750
01:48:49,599 --> 01:48:53,159
framing because they're fairly can be

2751
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,480
lightweight now I'm not saying that

2752
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:56,679
they're light enough for all these

2753
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:59,839
frames but they're lighter than hanging

2754
01:48:56,679 --> 01:49:02,719
an LED or a HPS light that you might go

2755
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:06,520
get at the grow store right

2756
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:09,158
right totally and um and also they're

2757
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:11,199
they run a lot less hot too correct they

2758
01:49:09,158 --> 01:49:13,118
do run a lot less hot and so something

2759
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:14,960
like those string lights can be a great

2760
01:49:13,118 --> 01:49:16,559
way to say okay I'm going to bring my

2761
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,239
plants out whatever time of the year and

2762
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,719
I want to encourage this veg cycle and

2763
01:49:19,238 --> 01:49:23,678
and I don't want them to trigger into

2764
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:25,399
flowering by accident or the opposite

2765
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:28,039
might be that you know you want them to

2766
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:30,238
trigger into flowering and you're just

2767
01:49:28,039 --> 01:49:33,000
you know not getting enough sunlight in

2768
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:34,879
some cases or whatever that case may be

2769
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,760
you know this supplemental light is

2770
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:39,560
exactly what it is it's supplementing

2771
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:42,360
some light in order to keep those plants

2772
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:44,199
um in the stage that you're intending um

2773
01:49:42,359 --> 01:49:46,399
without trying to rely on them for

2774
01:49:44,198 --> 01:49:49,198
ultimately all the growth and production

2775
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:52,079
that's required yeah right on um there's

2776
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:53,559
one more topic I want to uh mention here

2777
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:56,238
we don't need to discuss it but I just

2778
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:59,199
want to throw this in out there for the

2779
01:49:56,238 --> 01:50:01,238
the the one person who needs it um if

2780
01:49:59,198 --> 01:50:03,559
you happen to live in a place with a

2781
01:50:01,238 --> 01:50:07,198
very short cultivation season like where

2782
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:09,560
I am in Washington state um you can also

2783
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:13,439
consider something that I learned from

2784
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:16,239
an OG uh Black Market grower in uh Port

2785
01:50:13,439 --> 01:50:21,319
Townsen if you're listening man I would

2786
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:22,879
love to see you again um he made raised

2787
01:50:21,319 --> 01:50:27,118
beds

2788
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:28,679
and he put in heaters in the soil

2789
01:50:27,118 --> 01:50:31,880
because one of the problems that we run

2790
01:50:28,679 --> 01:50:35,679
into is that after the evenings start to

2791
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:38,039
get under 50° the the containers go to

2792
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:40,239
sleep right all of your all your micro

2793
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:42,479
life falls asleep from from the

2794
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:44,439
consistent cold and so that tells the

2795
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:47,359
roots we're done and so the plants

2796
01:50:44,439 --> 01:50:50,158
finish up and start to mold but he would

2797
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:52,399
keep um he he would trick out his tents

2798
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:55,679
with the lights and then he would also

2799
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:58,118
put them in warmed beds and like he was

2800
01:50:55,679 --> 01:51:00,399
growing outdoors and harvesting like

2801
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:03,039
first week in January and stuff and like

2802
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:06,000
in Washington that's ridiculous he said

2803
01:51:03,039 --> 01:51:09,800
that he was able to um go until the snow

2804
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,880
started to be too heavy on his on his um

2805
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:14,239
hoop and then he had to be done so so if

2806
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:17,118
you happen to be in one of those places

2807
01:51:14,238 --> 01:51:19,678
where um the the season is cold and you

2808
01:51:17,118 --> 01:51:22,639
are in containers there's an idea for

2809
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:24,399
you 100% I was going to bring that up

2810
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:26,440
earlier and I kind of just moved through

2811
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:29,039
things and forgot but that the radiant

2812
01:51:26,439 --> 01:51:31,598
heat is really important for production

2813
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:34,679
going into those colder months or parts

2814
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:36,400
of the areas of the country um anytime

2815
01:51:34,679 --> 01:51:38,679
that you have your substrate start to go

2816
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:41,039
below even 60° like you're saying

2817
01:51:38,679 --> 01:51:43,000
everything starts to hibernate and slows

2818
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:45,000
down progress and so we want our soil

2819
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,639
temps to be 69 to

2820
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,439
70° and so that also means we don't want

2821
01:51:47,639 --> 01:51:53,118
to use freezing cold water to irrigate

2822
01:51:50,439 --> 01:51:56,000
with when we do go irrigate so I'm not

2823
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:57,559
advocating hot water but I am advocating

2824
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,840
you know something that's temperate and

2825
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:02,239
not straight out of the ground at you

2826
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:05,039
know 40 or 50° so if you can get your

2827
01:52:02,238 --> 01:52:06,879
water closer to 70 it doesn't have to be

2828
01:52:05,039 --> 01:52:09,319
hot because hot water will actually

2829
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:11,599
start to grow bad things and cause

2830
01:52:09,319 --> 01:52:13,238
problems as well but we want to avoid

2831
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:15,039
the freezing cold and the other thing

2832
01:52:13,238 --> 01:52:16,959
that people have done is they've you

2833
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:19,639
know maybe wrapped their beds or even

2834
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:23,198
their grow pots in some type of

2835
01:52:19,639 --> 01:52:25,760
insulation the the the most most low

2836
01:52:23,198 --> 01:52:28,439
cost effective might be straw mulch even

2837
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:29,599
that they wrap around them there's other

2838
01:52:28,439 --> 01:52:31,759
people that you know you're familiar

2839
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:34,440
with hash makers they'll wrap their

2840
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,599
washing machine with that um myar

2841
01:52:34,439 --> 01:52:38,519
looking bubble wrap stuff that is

2842
01:52:36,599 --> 01:52:41,000
insulate of and it can get wet it

2843
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:42,760
doesn't fall apart you know and so that

2844
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,198
kind of stuff chopped up and wrapped

2845
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:47,280
around your pots or your beds in

2846
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:50,000
conjunction with the idea of adding some

2847
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:52,920
heat and so there are some radiant heat

2848
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,760
ideas and companies out there um you and

2849
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:56,158
I always throw these selfless plugs

2850
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:58,520
we're not connected to any of these

2851
01:52:56,158 --> 01:53:01,920
companies usually but we plug them

2852
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:05,320
anyway um there's a company I think in

2853
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:07,920
the midwest called radiant Tech and it's

2854
01:53:05,319 --> 01:53:10,359
you know radiant TEC at the end radiant

2855
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:13,158
Tech has a lot of do-it-yourself um

2856
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:15,679
supplies for creating a um a radiant

2857
01:53:13,158 --> 01:53:17,238
heating system and then there's another

2858
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:19,319
company that's more commercial but I

2859
01:53:17,238 --> 01:53:21,759
think they do have some hobby kits now

2860
01:53:19,319 --> 01:53:24,840
and they're good people called biotherm

2861
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:27,280
in California and biotherm also provides

2862
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:29,119
radiant heat systems for commercial

2863
01:53:27,279 --> 01:53:31,479
green houses but again I think they have

2864
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:33,880
something on the hobby side uh but if

2865
01:53:31,479 --> 01:53:35,359
you're considering extending the seasons

2866
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:37,118
if you're considering growing in the

2867
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:38,799
winter or if you're growing in a place

2868
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:39,880
like where you guys have the short

2869
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,960
really short

2870
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:43,840
Seasons some of these things could be

2871
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:45,399
beneficial if not all of them at least

2872
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:47,159
one of them and the and that would be

2873
01:53:45,399 --> 01:53:49,479
not irrigating with the freezing cold

2874
01:53:47,158 --> 01:53:51,799
water don't pull it up from your well

2875
01:53:49,479 --> 01:53:53,519
and put it right on the plants yeah

2876
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:55,719
exactly you're not going to want to

2877
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,000
bathe in that so neither are they right

2878
01:53:55,719 --> 01:54:01,198
on all right so the last topic I want us

2879
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:05,158
to touch on Eric um you have told me so

2880
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:09,598
many times to make sure that I put to

2881
01:54:05,158 --> 01:54:11,839
get put away my Greenhouse skin properly

2882
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:13,840
because they are expensive and if I

2883
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,000
don't clean it before I put it away it's

2884
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:18,920
going to get crappy over the winter and

2885
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,000
then I did not listen to you and I

2886
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:24,520
screwed up all my stuff and so I had to

2887
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,560
replace the Plastics and next year so um

2888
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:28,920
uh going forward I now listen to you and

2889
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:31,239
I make sure I I wash down the greenhouse

2890
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:33,679
let it dry and fold it up before you

2891
01:54:31,238 --> 01:54:35,678
know before the weather gets too bad but

2892
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:38,078
I I I can imagine that there is some

2893
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:40,880
like General upkeep that should probably

2894
01:54:38,078 --> 01:54:42,319
be done on these Greenhouse skins over

2895
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,039
the year like I don't know if there's a

2896
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:47,920
plastic conditioner or anything and then

2897
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:50,399
they should be put away correctly so

2898
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:53,319
will you give us your little your little

2899
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:55,118
best thoughts on taking care hair of the

2900
01:54:53,319 --> 01:54:58,439
greenhouse and how to properly put it

2901
01:54:55,118 --> 01:55:00,759
away for the season sure I mean there a

2902
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:03,279
little soap and water goes a long ways I

2903
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:05,280
mean I think if you were to look online

2904
01:55:03,279 --> 01:55:07,158
of somebody like Greenhouse mega store

2905
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:09,359
or Griffin greenhouse and maybe even a

2906
01:55:07,158 --> 01:55:12,039
company that in Santa Barbara called

2907
01:55:09,359 --> 01:55:15,279
total Energy Group total Energy Group

2908
01:55:12,039 --> 01:55:18,639
sells a lot of um whitewash materials so

2909
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:20,319
that you can you know add um you know a

2910
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,359
lot of green houses in the winter time

2911
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:23,639
that are commercial that might be glass

2912
01:55:22,359 --> 01:55:26,039
I'm sorry in the

2913
01:55:23,639 --> 01:55:28,520
summertime that don't have a automated

2914
01:55:26,039 --> 01:55:31,039
shade cloth or something like that um

2915
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:33,199
will spray a whitewash type of a paint

2916
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:35,158
on the glass and so it basically calms

2917
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:37,678
down the sun's intensity because it

2918
01:55:35,158 --> 01:55:39,439
takes away some of that transparency and

2919
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:42,039
then it washes off in the winter time or

2920
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:44,198
when it rains and so companies like that

2921
01:55:42,039 --> 01:55:46,920
might sell a conditioner of some kind

2922
01:55:44,198 --> 01:55:49,678
but I would say that you know in a lot

2923
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:53,039
of areas of cannabis growing I've gone

2924
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:56,279
out and seen that you know there is

2925
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:58,158
um quite a bit of particulate that

2926
01:55:56,279 --> 01:56:00,359
settles on these greenhouse frames

2927
01:55:58,158 --> 01:56:02,679
whether it's dust or environmental stuff

2928
01:56:00,359 --> 01:56:04,439
pine needles or whatever it's not out of

2929
01:56:02,679 --> 01:56:05,960
the question to go out there once a week

2930
01:56:04,439 --> 01:56:08,399
once a month and just hose the

2931
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:10,719
greenhouse down with a hose so that you

2932
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:12,679
get some of that particulate off and

2933
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:14,960
then when it comes to wintertime like

2934
01:56:12,679 --> 01:56:17,599
you were saying is taking it completely

2935
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:19,840
off and it not only protects the skin it

2936
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:21,599
protects the frame because as you were

2937
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,880
saying earlier if we get a tremendous

2938
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:25,560
amount of rain it can build up into the

2939
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:29,118
greenhouse in these little pockets and

2940
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:31,239
saggy spots if it snows that snow load

2941
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:33,439
will take down the greenhouse frame and

2942
01:56:31,238 --> 01:56:36,479
so will the rain if it gets enough water

2943
01:56:33,439 --> 01:56:38,678
trapped on top of it in weird places and

2944
01:56:36,479 --> 01:56:40,678
so by taking the greenhouse cover off

2945
01:56:38,679 --> 01:56:44,000
we're avoiding the frame collapsing or

2946
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:46,039
bending or creating any stress on it and

2947
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,679
then it's also going to make that cover

2948
01:56:46,039 --> 01:56:50,439
last a lot longer one of the things or

2949
01:56:48,679 --> 01:56:52,000
mistakes people do is they'll just fold

2950
01:56:50,439 --> 01:56:53,799
it up and stick it in the garage and

2951
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,520
what ends up happening is for some

2952
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:59,360
reason I don't know what it is but mice

2953
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:01,679
just seem to be attracted to plastic and

2954
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:03,279
weird things like this and they bore a

2955
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:04,960
hole in the side of it when it's folded

2956
01:57:03,279 --> 01:57:08,359
up and then when you go unfolded it's

2957
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:10,719
like a piece of Swiss cheese um and so

2958
01:57:08,359 --> 01:57:12,960
you know having that piece of plastic

2959
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:16,000
rolled up and maybe put into a cardboard

2960
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,639
box simply is enough um i' for some

2961
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,039
reason the mice don't always bore

2962
01:57:17,639 --> 01:57:22,679
through them they can uh but for some

2963
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:24,439
reason they tend to leave stuff alone um

2964
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:26,199
if you can get a black and yellow tote

2965
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:28,638
and fit it inside of that that might

2966
01:57:26,198 --> 01:57:31,759
even be a better solution for really

2967
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:34,599
keeping anything out and bugs and and

2968
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:37,159
rodents that that way um I would never

2969
01:57:34,599 --> 01:57:40,039
recommend using any kind of rodent um

2970
01:57:37,158 --> 01:57:42,238
killer or spray or anything because a

2971
01:57:40,039 --> 01:57:45,319
lot of the products or chemicals in

2972
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:48,559
those products um Can Be bioaccumulated

2973
01:57:45,319 --> 01:57:50,319
by cannabis and cause a test fail and so

2974
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:53,199
um trying to keep the like I said soap

2975
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:54,759
and water letting it dry folding it up

2976
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:56,559
putting it in a box or a black and

2977
01:57:54,760 --> 01:58:00,880
yellow tote of some kind and stick it in

2978
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:03,840
the garage maybe um somewhere up high or

2979
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:05,560
or um easy to keep away from the kids

2980
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,239
and the animals and things like that and

2981
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:09,360
your Greenhouse cover is going to last

2982
01:58:07,238 --> 01:58:12,039
way longer than probably even the

2983
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:15,118
manufacturer specifications

2984
01:58:12,039 --> 01:58:17,439
state right on now that's the kind of

2985
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:19,238
experience I was looking for you know

2986
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:21,399
the idea of throwing it in a black and

2987
01:58:19,238 --> 01:58:23,638
yellow tote is so obvious and I missed

2988
01:58:21,399 --> 01:58:25,238
it I've actually run into the the the

2989
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:27,400
rat problems that you've got with them

2990
01:58:25,238 --> 01:58:30,678
eating through it and so mine are

2991
01:58:27,399 --> 01:58:33,439
actually suspended from rope from the

2992
01:58:30,679 --> 01:58:35,599
ceiling okay and U but I actually like

2993
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:38,319
your idea of putting it in the black and

2994
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:41,560
white a lot better cuz well it doesn't

2995
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:43,840
look as weird um but also it it won't go

2996
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:46,239
through all the temperature changes as

2997
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:49,078
the the the ambient air in the

2998
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:51,078
garage yeah so that's good so all right

2999
01:58:49,078 --> 01:58:53,479
cool well Eric let's wrap up man um

something one of these these days so we

3016
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:27,639
can hang out again but it's got to be

3017
01:59:25,319 --> 01:59:30,519
the right thing so when that comes up

3018
01:59:27,639 --> 01:59:32,679
I'll be calling you yeah the the man I I

3019
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:34,800
miss because it used to be like it at

3020
01:59:32,679 --> 01:59:37,239
the very least you and I saw each other

3021
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,840
at Emerald cup and and and like you know

3022
01:59:37,238 --> 01:59:40,198
I don't I don't want to uh dis Emerald

3023
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:42,520
cup cuz I know you're still heavy there

3024
01:59:40,198 --> 01:59:43,919
as a judge but Emerald cup has changed

3025
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:45,840
you know and and it just doesn't bring

3026
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:48,880
all the people that it used to and and I

3027
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:51,119
I miss that old family it's changed a

3028
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,840
lot and it yeah I miss a lot of that too

3029
01:59:51,118 --> 01:59:54,399
it's it's definitely not the same and

3030
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:57,679
there's some other events out there that

3031
01:59:54,399 --> 01:59:59,719
are kind of like that but um yeah it's

3032
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:01,599
it's all changed and the events are all

3033
01:59:59,719 --> 02:00:04,279
different but one of these days

3034
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:06,159
something's going to you know happen and

3035
02:00:04,279 --> 02:00:09,078
we're going to be like hey we'll be at

3036
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:11,158
that see you there yeah I mean the

3037
02:00:09,078 --> 02:00:12,960
Wonderland days were great too for

3038
02:00:11,158 --> 02:00:15,158
meeting up I mean I missed the

3039
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:17,078
Wonderland days and you know some of

3040
02:00:15,158 --> 02:00:19,759
those spring kickoffs and things that

3041
02:00:17,078 --> 02:00:21,238
Kevin used to throw up there um you know

3042
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,800
people just don't want to travel like

3043
02:00:21,238 --> 02:00:25,238
they used to

3044
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,760
especially um you know a lot of The

3045
02:00:25,238 --> 02:00:29,718
Growers I think the most popular event

3046
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:31,719
or one of the more popular NorCal events

3047
02:00:29,719 --> 02:00:35,480
nowaday that just happen is the ego

3048
02:00:31,719 --> 02:00:38,520
Clash I've never been but uh it seems to

3049
02:00:35,479 --> 02:00:41,238
be you know the new community event yeah

3050
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:45,800
I agree I do think that um the these

3051
02:00:41,238 --> 02:00:48,559
these uh specialty very small ultra high

3052
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:50,360
quality events is where it is right now

3053
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:52,960
I'd love to see The Return of a big

3054
02:00:50,359 --> 02:00:55,719
event but it would have to take a very

3055
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:58,679
particular promoter to pull it off so

3056
02:00:55,719 --> 02:01:01,279
that it doesn't get usurped as much by

3057
02:00:58,679 --> 02:01:04,158
the the commodity advertising and turn

3058
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:05,960
it into what everything else is but um

3059
02:01:04,158 --> 02:01:09,118
totally I would definitely support such

3060
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:10,560
