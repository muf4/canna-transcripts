1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
thank you thank you thank

2
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,719
you so this is so for those of you who

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,719
have been to vime meetings but not one

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,879
on the very first ones this is how we

5
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:29,118
used to do it in the early days when

6
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,599
when our goal was to help people find um

7
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,399
out whether or not they want wanted to

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,159
apply for a license it was simply 15 or

9
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,558
20 of us sitting in this room and me

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,238
just kind of teaching the regulations

11
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,640
and then then after the wave of licenses

12
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:45,280
came out um we still wanted to get

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,558
together and so we started bringing in

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,160
some of the top speakers in the world uh

15
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:51,320
to talk about candidates and none of

16
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,718
them are here

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,878
tonight um so

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,920
so I've tried to do this other years

19
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,920
with different speakers because the goal

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,359
was to have have a speaker at the

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,519
beginning of the season to to present a

22
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:10,560
really easy strategy for growing that

23
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,158
anybody could do and the last two years

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,200
when we had those speakers they did

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,600
great presentations but they very

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,879
quickly got above the beginners head

27
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,478
space because they themselves were so

28
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,640
Pro and so this year instead of booking

29
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,920
someone to do the speak to do the

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,759
presentation I figured since I keep on

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,719
thinking I know how to do it right I

32
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,319
might as well just do it this year and

33
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,679
and present the the super simple

34
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,000
beginner guide to growing so so that's

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,040
what's going to happen this year and um

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,239
so there are some immediate assumptions

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,759
going in so number one we're assing that

38
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:48,599
you're growing Outdoors um this is all

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,478
about uh having some plans in your yard

40
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,280
for the summer growing it under the sun

41
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,959
and and and so we're not going to talk

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,560
anything about um indoor growing

43
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:00,559
specifically even though some of it can

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,960
be cross applied very easily two we're

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,039
also assuming that you're growing for

46
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:07,239
yourself and not for sale uh two reasons

47
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,878
number one um that's that's that's

48
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,000
legally sticky to to to suggest that I'm

49
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:13,199
going to try to teach you how to grow

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
for commercially but more importantly

51
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,199
I'm not going to be teaching how to grow

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,479
uh in volume or necessarily how to grow

53
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,399
for the best looking in a bag we are

54
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,919
looking for you to have the skill set to

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,159
grow for your own usage to get the

56
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:30,559
relief that you can that you're looking

57
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,199
for

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,400
um we're also going to be teaching

59
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:37,079
another assumption is that we're doing

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,080
this for ease of e easiness over

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,640
production volume right so we're looking

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,280
for that the easiest route at every turn

63
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,518
instead of because there's certainly

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,719
things that you can do that to get to

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,680
get bigger plants with with more on them

66
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,479
and and and and the way it goes to make

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,680
more money right but that's that's not

68
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,759
really what we're doing here what we're

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,120
doing is we're trying to make it simple

70
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,679
so that everybody can have an

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,200
opportunity to grow and then finally I

72
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,319
recognize a lot of the established

73
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:10,079
growers in the room they all know more

74
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,719
than I do and in the past that's been

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,719
part of the problem is because people

76
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,598
have started to talk over their head so

77
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,799
if you are a grower in the room um I

78
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,518
know that there are different ways to do

79
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,439
this and I know that there are better

80
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,680
ways to do a lot of this but that's not

81
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,039
our goal today it's not about me trying

82
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,159
to impress with what I know about

83
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,840
Advanced growing this is about

84
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:34,079
simplifying it so everybody in the room

85
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,080
can

86
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,879
grow all right so with those assumptions

87
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:46,959
in hand part one do you really want to

88
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:49,598
grow so the law says right now if you do

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,039
not have a medical authorization you do

90
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,078
not have any right in the state of

91
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,400
Washington to grow a

92
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,680
plant if you have a medical

93
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,640
authorization you can grow four

94
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,640
plants if you have a medical

95
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,238
authorization and you choose to sign up

96
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,238
for the state

97
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,360
registry your four plants become six

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,759
plants if you have a medical

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,720
authorization and you're on the

100
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:21,079
registry and your doctor writes in at

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,000
the bottom of your license of your

102
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,639
authorization you can grow up to 15

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,160
plans so the best possible scenario that

104
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,680
is legal for you is if you have a

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,280
medical authorization and it's on the

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,280
new form and at the bottom your doctor

107
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,478
has written that you can have up to 15

108
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,758
plants and that is the maximum that you

109
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,279
can have on your partials 15

110
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,240
plants now if you don't have a medical

111
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,599
authorization um there is a possibility

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,960
though it's remote that the Washington

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,879
legislature will uh Pass personal grows

114
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:57,918
here in Washington like they have in

115
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,399
other legalized States but I wouldn't

116
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,439
hold my breath for that and so what we

117
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,879
see is that every year more individual

118
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,560
Americans are choosing to grow

119
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,759
regardless of what their state law is

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,000
because they feel they should be able to

121
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:17,759
while I'm not here to give you um legal

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,038
advice I would say that what I'm what

123
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,160
we're teaching here tonight can be used

124
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,918
in the face of your state laws use your

125
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,160
discretion and figure out how much risk

126
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:32,599
you're willing to go for in order to

127
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,280
provide your own medicine here on Bashon

128
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,680
the only place to get medical cannabis

129
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,159
is about to close because as of July 1st

130
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,199
all the dispensaries in the state have

131
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,039
got to close and because we are such a

132
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,080
small population and most of us grow for

133
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,560
ourselves it's going to be a while

134
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,198
before we get a recreational store on

135
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,560
the island so that means that after July

136
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,120
1st you can either go over town and shop

137
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,240
at a recreational store

138
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,800
oh yeah or that's it so this is why a

139
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,519
lot of people started have been asking

140
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,120
me about simple basics in growing and

141
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,120
this is why we are getting together

142
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,478
tonight so your family and your

143
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,360
neighbors probably have an

144
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,758
opinion so think about that um you may

145
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,439
have neighbors who might give you a hard

146
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,919
time you might have family who come over

147
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,680
for your barbecue this summer and they

148
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,799
might give you a hard time think about

149
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,199
that in advance because because once

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,120
it's happening

151
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,520
um it's it's not that positive it may

152
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,519
not be a big deal for you but think

153
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:40,839
about that in advance and also consider

154
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:44,519
um that you might want to stand with the

155
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,959
plant and even though your aunt or your

156
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,399
friend or your neighbor might have a

157
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,560
little bit of a problem that you've got

158
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,279
three plants on your porch maybe

159
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,240
consider just being okay with that and

160
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,559
and causing a conversation that might

161
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,160
open up somebody's eyes whatever you

162
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,918
decide make sure you consider it before

163
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,240
you go in to put in all the work that it

164
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,878
takes part two where to grow at your

165
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,680
home so a couple things to consider are

166
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:14,400
these iight from passers by it is a

167
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,240
classic sad story and they're known as

168
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,918
rippers people who go past your garden

169
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,079
every day and they see your cannabis

170
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:23,878
plants growing and they know just enough

171
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,240
that if they they know that if they wait

172
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,599
until the end of September or the

173
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,400
beginning of October they can stop by

174
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,279
your place and pick up your plant right

175
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,198
before you

176
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:36,878
harvest that's such a drag and so um it

177
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,840
is important to place your plants

178
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,520
somewhere out of line of sight from

179
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,318
people who are passing your property

180
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,918
second um you're also going to want to

181
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,319
do it close to water and you'll

182
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,478
understand why after you grow for the

183
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,400
first time because you're going to be

184
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,318
bringing water over there all the time

185
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:58,239
for the entirety of the summer like

186
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,919
pretty much through Halloween and and

187
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,478
and bringing water to your plants

188
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,198
Mother's Day through Halloween that's a

189
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:08,478
lot of water so it makes sense to have a

190
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:11,879
plan to have the water there um have it

191
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,839
be a location that you remember exists

192
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,080
so that you don't forget that the plants

193
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,679
are there it's incredibly common for

194
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,878
people to say you know like oh I went

195
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,038
over town and then oh the next day we

196
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,639
had a family party and then oh my gosh I

197
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,158
haven't water my plants in 3 days and

198
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,800
the weather's been so great and you go

199
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:32,158
back there and the plant has burned and

200
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,639
damaged so you want to make sure that

201
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:37,038
you're putting it out of sight a passers

202
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,360
by so that it doesn't get ripped but at

203
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,479
the same time you want to put it

204
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,479
somewhere where it will be an ey shot

205
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,920
for yourself um so that you remember to

206
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:50,720
tend it since you're just building these

207
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,719
habits and finally

208
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:59,838
deer deer love cannabis in its

209
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,399
vegetation stage um they seem seem to be

210
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,959
prefer some strange more than others but

211
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,919
they really like just to bite that top

212
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:11,000
green delicious top of the V vegetating

213
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,799
plant and so recognize that if you have

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,600
a garden with a deer fence as many of us

215
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:18,719
do here on Bashon Island I encourage you

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,519
to consider putting your plants in your

217
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,399
behind your deer fence um it is

218
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,879
incredibly common for people to grow

219
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,440
outside of a deer fence and have no

220
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,399
problem especially if you don't have

221
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,920
deer and instead you have more coyotes

222
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,000
on the island

223
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,319
um but be aware of that possibility

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,480
because it would be a shame for your for

225
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,600
your plants to get to the point where

226
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,039
they're just about to flip to be start

227
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,200
blooming and you come outside and

228
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,360
they've been chomped and and you know

229
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,160
they'll still grow but it it really

230
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,639
impedes your success so those are all

231
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,639
things that you want to consider when

232
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:55,799
choosing where to grow your

233
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:59,120
own next is the decision of do you want

234
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:02,000
to go into the ground or do you want

235
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,240
want to go into a container and there

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,559
are a couple different things to

237
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,519
consider here so so first of all the

238
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:14,958
ground is great it's got the natural

239
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:18,278
microbial life that exists in the ground

240
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:21,359
um The Roots can go as far as it wants

241
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:23,958
to into the ground and it allows your

242
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,839
plant to really stretch up because it's

243
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:29,559
got this fantastic base to hold itself

244
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,279
steady and that's fantastic

245
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,479
the hard part is though is that when

246
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:36,000
you're in the ground you can't move the

247
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,000
plant and one of the challenges that we

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,600
have here in the Northwest generally but

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,759
definitely on Bashon island is most of

250
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,879
the different uh strains or cultivars of

251
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,159
plants that are available to us in the

252
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,480
Northwest they're not going to finish

253
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:54,159
blooming until probably the first to

254
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,480
third week of

255
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,480
October if you're lucky and you get a

256
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,800
strain like shisa Berry or something

257
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,039
like that that blooms in 6 weeks you

258
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,599
might be out and done the end of

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,919
September but more often than not you're

260
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,759
going to be looking at your plant the

261
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,759
first week in October trying to decide

262
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,679
to cut it because you're looking at your

263
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:18,759
phone and it says rain and fall for the

264
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,078
next 3 days and and and if you're in the

265
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,120
ground that decision becomes a lot more

266
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:24,120
difficult because you have less

267
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,879
flexibility in contrast containers are

268
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,799
really really convenient

269
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,399
um you can grow in any container that's

270
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,039
at least 5

271
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:40,078
gallons um you can move it around your

272
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,879
yard if you need to um some small

273
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,879
Growers on the island even have gotten a

274
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,759
special hand truck just for moving their

275
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:49,200
plants around their yard and some of the

276
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,838
more resourceful folks that I've met um

277
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,240
they'll have three or four plants on

278
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:57,440
their patio and they'll get one of those

279
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,639
circular trays with the wheels on the

280
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,320
bottom and now they're sliding it all

281
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,759
around their deck depending on where the

282
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,278
sun is and if it's raining you slide it

283
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:11,679
underneath the uh the roof do hicky over

284
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:14,278
your deck it's a pretty great plan um uh

285
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:18,519
if you're in the ground you better plan

286
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:20,799
on on covering your plant at some point

287
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,879
and so there's lots of ways to do that I

288
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:28,120
have seen uh creatively placed beach

289
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:31,759
umbrellas um I have seen um a thick

290
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,360
plastic VIs bought from Home Depot that

291
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,679
has been attached to the house and then

292
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,759
brought down at an angle for poles over

293
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:43,359
the plants so that the rain uh sheets

294
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,919
off um you know maybe you even have um

295
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,440
you know some kind of structure outside

296
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:52,639
that um uh that you can you know uh rig

297
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,000
up to somehow but you really want to

298
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,799
think about this ahead of time because

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,278
our weather normally changes to be

300
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,159
threatening before the plants are done

301
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,720
and this is something that Bashon

302
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,799
Growers have been having to deal with

303
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,519
since their early 70s so you're not

304
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,439
alone and this is not a new problem but

305
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,679
do think about it ahead of time

306
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,880
especially if you're going to go into

307
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,439
the ground because once you're in the

308
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,559
ground you're there for

309
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,920
kees um all right I think that's that

310
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:25,039
there so so let's move on to soil and

311
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:30,039
nutrients also known as part

312
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:33,879
three so there are so many different

313
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:37,240
strategies for building your own soil

314
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:40,480
for for creating your own nutrients for

315
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,320
buying expensive and sexy nutrients at

316
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,039
the hydroponic

317
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,399
store we are going to talk about the

318
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:51,559
simple and cheap way and so these are

319
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,720
some of the suggestions number one the

320
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:58,799
the path of lease resistance you can

321
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,879
simply go to one of the the island shops

322
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,639
and pick up bags of soil and put it in

323
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,159
the

324
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,959
pot I don't usually recommend that for

325
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,879
indoor because so often the bags of soil

326
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,039
here on the island when you open them

327
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,679
they're going to have bugs in them and

328
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,519
that can ruin an indoor garden but you

329
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:22,758
got a lot more room for error Outdoors

330
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,399
because when you grow indoors um you

331
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:29,079
have got an artificial environment so

332
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:31,919
you are God you have to do everything

333
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:36,078
that nature would normally do but

334
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:39,078
Outdoors if you use soil with bugs there

335
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,359
are predators for those bugs also in

336
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:46,239
your yard and so every time I've ever

337
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,720
used I mean I I use I use I use insect

338
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,079
soil outdoors I swear and every year the

339
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,759
natural world just cleans them up um so

340
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:58,120
so so that is number one uh is you could

341
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,519
just use Simple potting soil from the

342
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,879
shop if you do that do your plant a

343
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,759
favor and grab some compost out your

344
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,480
compost bin or or or grab ask your

345
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,039
neighbor for some compost out of their

346
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,480
bin and mix it in with the soil because

347
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:18,039
honestly potting soil is as close to

348
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,720
Inner as you can get without putting it

349
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:24,838
in the oven first and and the idea is to

350
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,399
create an environment where the soil is

351
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,759
is as alive as you can get it to be so

352
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,198
that it's a constant Buffet of nutrients

353
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,000
for your plant to pull from as it's

354
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:39,399
growing so that's your bare minimum just

355
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,440
get some potting soil throw some compost

356
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,000
in it call it good second version you

357
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,959
want to do a little bit of upgrade um

358
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,879
you can still do the plain bags of soil

359
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:57,559
but also throw in some store bought

360
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:59,439
fertilizers and and you can Google

361
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,638
cannabis fertilizer

362
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,480
and learn how to spend a lot of money

363
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,360
and and and many of those fertilizers

364
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,879
are worth the effort and the money but

365
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,079
again this is the simplest thing

366
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:18,399
possible and so another possibility is

367
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:20,559
mixing with your bag of soil um just for

368
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,078
the first half so this would be from

369
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,439
when you grow it uh to when the the

370
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,159
daylight changes which we'll talk a

371
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,839
little bit more uh in a minute just use

372
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,360
simp fertilizer for growing vegetables

373
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,160
if you've got a food Garden at your

374
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,680
house like most of us do on the island

375
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,399
you probably already have vegetable

376
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,838
fertilizers and so uh following the

377
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,720
directions on it mix that in with your

378
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,600
soil for the first um for the first part

379
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,959
the vegetative state where your plant is

380
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,720
just trying to get um as large as it can

381
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:57,239
before it starts to make

382
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:01,079
flowers um professional Growers will

383
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,959
talk so much trash about using just

384
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,720
regular vegetable

385
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:08,639
nutrients but again you can get

386
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,640
sophisticated but you don't have

387
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,759
to

388
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,160
after uh August

389
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:19,720
15th the days will become 12 days of

390
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,000
light and 12 days excuse me 12 hours of

391
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,600
light and 12 hours of Darkness this is

392
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,038
what causes the canace plant to start

393
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:34,079
creating flowers and so now um your your

394
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,640
your vegetable nutrients are you know

395
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,119
they're still going to be decent but

396
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,360
they're not really what you're going to

397
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,839
uh what you're going to be looking for

398
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:44,119
if you're looking um if you're going to

399
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:46,839
spend some money switch on over the the

400
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:49,599
um the True Value now Ace has got a

401
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:51,918
fantastic selection of nutrients that

402
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,879
are for Bloom and that's what you're

403
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,159
looking for you are looking for Bloom

404
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,720
mixtures and it says Bloom on it you're

405
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,600
probably going to be good to go

406
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,480
um and uh I always encourage folks to

407
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,558
please lean towards the organic stuff

408
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,000
and the reason why I say this to you is

409
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:17,599
TW full um first and

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,200
foremost a lot of the a lot of the um

411
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,399
nutrients that use petrochemicals or

412
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,240
some other synthetic chemicals that you

413
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,200
can use in your food

414
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,400
Garden they are used to being in the

415
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,558
food Garden having rain on them getting

416
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:38,759
washed off and and then eaten in small

417
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:41,599
doses that is a big difference from the

418
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:44,279
plant picking up the nutrients putting

419
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,839
them in the flowers and then you

420
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:49,960
potentially burning them a lot of the

421
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,639
chemicals that are okay for our food

422
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,159
crops have never been tested for

423
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,880
combustion so you might have a plan to

424
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,880
make oil or edibles out of yours if

425
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,120
that's the medicine you prefer but a lot

426
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,000
of us are just going to be rolling

427
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,639
joints and and and and a lot of these

428
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,839
chemicals have never been tested under a

429
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,400
lighter so that's number one I want you

430
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,000
to be healthy um second is is just like

431
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,798
all chemical fertilizers there's going

432
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,279
to be runoff and you know if you if if

433
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:23,158
you saw the red tide we had around the

434
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,759
island last year red tide happens when

435
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:28,919
the fertilizers and the nutrients from

436
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:31,480
the island run off into the drains

437
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,080
and they they they hang out around the

438
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,880
island and then it gets hot and then

439
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,038
suddenly we've got this thick algae

440
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,120
bloom which makes um all of our filter

441
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,919
feeders and our clams and we can't eat

442
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:44,439
any of that stuff because of the red

443
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,960
tide it's terrible for the environment

444
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,200
and and it's just generally lame so what

445
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,679
if at all possible I encourage you to go

446
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,200
towards things that are marked organic

447
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,240
or have got natural sources both for

448
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,798
your health and the health of the

449
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,798
island

450
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,798
yay

451
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:10,359
woo so cannabis really does not like to

452
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,279
have her feet wet and so it's a really

453
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:16,000
good idea to put something in your soil

454
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,079
mixture that will allow it to drain

455
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,400
really easily um that's done a couple

456
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:27,319
different ways uh some folks like to mix

457
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:30,600
pearlite or coconut clar c i r into

458
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:33,839
their soil which allows the soil to hold

459
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:40,079
the water it needs but not longer than

460
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:42,519
it needs it and um my mentor puts uh a

461
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,038
bunch of Pebbles about an inch and a

462
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:48,038
half of pebbles in the bottom so that if

463
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:51,480
there's any overwatering it will collect

464
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:54,519
down there and be pulled out of the soil

465
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,360
um so that it can the the you know the

466
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,480
little holes on the bottom of your of

467
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:00,399
your pot uh it makes it easier and they

468
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,640
don't get all clogged up and the water

469
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,679
just runs out and so um that will be

470
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,120
something you know again if you want to

471
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,640
have the expenditure or if you have

472
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:13,439
bevels on your property that's another

473
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,960
good way to go to to give you more room

474
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
for error because that's what we're

475
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,600
doing here as beginner Growers is we

476
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,480
want to create as much room for error as

477
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,678
possible because there will be error and

478
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,200
you will learn from them and then next

479
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,880
summer you will have an even more

480
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,440
successful crop because you'll have all

481
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,440
this new

482
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,039
knowledge if you want to upgrade from

483
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:40,000
bag soil I want to tell you about living

484
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,919
soil so we won't dwell on this too much

485
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,400
but I'm a big fan of it if you can

486
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:49,240
afford it one of our sponsors is Ion

487
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,559
organic soil they're out of Tacoma and

488
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,480
we also have another sponsor uh keep it

489
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:58,639
simple Organics out of redond and they

490
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:02,759
both make soils that are micro

491
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,720
microbiotic alive and and ion Organics

492
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,400
even says that with their soil that all

493
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,839
you have to do is add water it's already

494
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,159
so living that throughout the entire

495
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:15,558
life process of the plant you don't have

496
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:19,760
to add any nutrients at all because the

497
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:22,480
soil itself is alive and the biological

498
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,319
processes are are are offputting

499
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,440
everything that your plant needs it's

500
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,319
super cool and it is absolutely the way

501
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,519
of the future

502
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:35,119
and it's expensive and it is also

503
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,079
reasonably priced because then you don't

504
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,199
aren't buying any nutrients and it makes

505
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:43,000
it much more foolproof so if you want to

506
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,919
look into that and and you know it's

507
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
it's it's usually about three times the

508
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,679
price of of just regular potting soil um

509
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,759
so if you're if you're trying to do it

510
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,080
on the cheap it might not be the option

511
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:56,440
but if you've got a little bit of room

512
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:59,879
to work with I encourage you to reach

513
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,120
out to to so you know either ion organic

514
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,919
soil or somebody else after you Google

515
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:08,759
living soils and go for something like

516
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:12,159
that um I used ion soils for the first

517
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:16,599
time myself last summer I've never seen

518
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:19,720
my plants be that good ever um the soil

519
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:24,158
is lighter which makes the the the pots

520
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:26,440
easier to carry um and and it is so

521
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,600
nutrient Rich that it's it's like this

522
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,960
buffet for the plant that anytime it

523
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:33,119
wants hm I think I want some phosphorus

524
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,120
or whatever it's like bam got it right

525
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,119
and so so it's definitely a step up but

526
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,439
but but know it exists if you want to if

527
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,558
you want to go that

528
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,600
far so the F the last two things are um

529
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:50,440
uh so my day job is um doing brand

530
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:54,798
strategy for entrepreneur.com and also

531
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:57,200
hosting their podcast and um and we've

532
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,558
had two podcasts recently that that if

533
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,558
you really want want to get into your

534
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:05,519
soil I suggest that you listen to and

535
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:07,759
they're both with uh Tad hussy who is

536
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,918
the is the founder actually the son of

537
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,679
the founder of keep it simple Organics

538
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,200
and Redmond and you can find either of

539
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,320
these by going to Gan preneur domcom in

540
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,200
the podcast section um or it's uh in

541
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:23,558
iTunes as well you can subscribe in

542
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,159
iTunes and the two uh shows specifically

543
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:29,079
that you'll get a lot of use out of are

544
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:33,000
the first one which is on on

545
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:36,000
wildcrafted nutrient teas and what this

546
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,960
means is Tad explains how you can go

547
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,159
around the island and identify certain

548
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,759
plants like for example comrey which may

549
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,919
be taking over your yard anyway and you

550
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,200
you pck these plants and you put them in

551
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,399
a 5 gallon bucket and you soak them for

552
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,600
a week to 10 days preferably with a

553
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:56,599
little bubbler but even that's not

554
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,719
absolutely necessary and after those

555
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,240
days you you take a Ladle out and you

556
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,558
pour that into your plants and he goes

557
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:08,399
through a whole series of plants that

558
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:10,158
will give you um you know silica or or

559
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:12,038
um whatever comfrey gives you I don't

560
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,200
remember them all but but um what you

561
00:25:12,038 --> 00:25:16,278
say everything everything there you go

562
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,679
so so he he goes through a list of like

563
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:21,558
six or seven of the different nutrients

564
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,679
that you can find naturally in your yard

565
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:25,079
and by wildcrafting them which just

566
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,200
simply means picking them out in the

567
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:31,798
wild um you can create for yourself

568
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,919
Ultra

569
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:36,359
natural um

570
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,960
Solutions um without having to go to the

571
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,639
store and buy bottled nutrients which

572
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,399
can be expensive but are super

573
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,919
convenient so that's the first one is is

574
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:50,798
nutrient wildcrafted teas with Tad hussy

575
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,360
the second one is also with Tad uh and

576
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:53,558
this is the second of about three-part

577
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,599
series that we're doing with him on the

578
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:56,440
show and it's all about building your

579
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,199
own

580
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,679
soil and so Tad will explain most of the

581
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,399
these inputs you need to pick up

582
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,360
somewhere but um you know between you

583
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:11,519
know crushed shells and and and other uh

584
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:14,038
components of building a soil that will

585
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:17,440
may or may not necessarily be living by

586
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:20,599
the ion organic standards but is a damn

587
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,720
good soil uh and and you will have taken

588
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:27,278
this this uh essentially inert potting

589
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,000
soil and and super packed it with with

590
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:32,880
new nutrients that your plant is going

591
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,079
to want and it's really fun to build

592
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,760
soil I mean it really it really gets you

593
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:40,759
a feeling like a farmer you put down a

594
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:43,398
tarp you throw the soil out you throw

595
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:45,000
the nutrients on top and you know in a

596
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,319
in a similar recipe that's on the

597
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,960
entrepreneur show or just Google

598
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,918
marijuana uh soil recipe I mean there's

599
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,200
a bunch of them out there and then

600
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,159
actually if you just want to Google it

601
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,640
the one that we recommend on the show is

602
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:01,679
by this guy named Clackamus coup

603
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,240
and U he is a brilliant dude who

604
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,600
understands soil biology fantastically

605
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:13,278
so clus what what's his name Clackamus

606
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:15,639
like Clackamus Oregon cou c t so

607
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,759
Clackamus cot I mean just just looking

608
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,960
him up and and seeing what he has to say

609
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,720
on growing boards and things like that

610
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,960
it's a good time I mean that's a quick

611
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,679
way to lose in evening but um but but

612
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,200
the goal through the presentation

613
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,919
tonight is to give you the basics for

614
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,919
growing and to open the doors for you in

615
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,038
case you want to get obsessive because

616
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,360
you can you know you'll you'll learn

617
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:40,759
enough tonight to grow something this

618
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:42,759
summer um but if you decide that you

619
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,720
have a passion or if you already know

620
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,079
you're passionate grower this may be

621
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,360
something that you enjoy doing for the

622
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,359
rest of your life so so be prepared you

623
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:52,158
know they say that uh cannabis is the

624
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,449
gateway to horiculture

625
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,519
so you might get

626
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,519
[Music]

627
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
addicted

628
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,080
all right so let's talk about the plant

629
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,359
itself so now you you understand like

630
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,720
where your yard you're going to put it

631
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,639
you understand that you're going to have

632
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,120
to deal with rain and fog and general

633
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,080
moisture come the

634
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:19,079
fall and and and and now you got to

635
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,119
figure out a plant so what we're not

636
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:26,158
going to talk about today tonight is

637
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:27,558
particular strain or cultivar types um

638
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,880
you know they've got names like you know

639
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:34,158
Granddaddy Purple mandarina Dutch tree

640
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,559
Sweet Baby Jane all of these are are key

641
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,720
words that that tell you a little bit

642
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:42,960
something about the plant's um genetics

643
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,200
where they're from

644
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,480
um to make a gross overgeneralization

645
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,840
essentially you've got indicas which are

646
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,880
going to help you relax and and help you

647
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:56,558
with pain you've got sativas which are

648
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,240
going to be motivating mentally focusing

649
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:03,558
and helping you with depression and then

650
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:06,278
you've got high CBD which are which uh

651
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:10,119
you're either going to have lots of CBD

652
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:12,480
and no THC or little THC or or lots of

653
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:15,479
CBD and some

654
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,480
THC

655
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,839
um so um so the goal here is not to help

656
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,080
you choose the strains but to let you

657
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:28,240
know that you're going to want to figure

658
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,720
out what you're looking for and then you

659
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,240
have to make a decision about whether or

660
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,159
not you want a clone or to grow from

661
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,679
seed and there is without a doubt a

662
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:41,080
preference to grow from clone if you are

663
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,720
a beginner um there are a lot of great

664
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:47,000
reasons to grow from seeds and I will

665
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,558
recommend seeds if you are this kind of

666
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,278
a person but clones are made from a

667
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,319
mother plant that's already growing the

668
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,159
grower that you buy it or your friend

669
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,319
who you barter with it or gives it to

670
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,960
you or whatever they will take a

671
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:04,398
snipping off their plant put it in some

672
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,960
rock wool put it under lights let it

673
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,000
root and then it ends up looking like

674
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,840
one of

675
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,640
these and that is a really easy nearly

676
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:17,240
foolproof way to start

677
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:21,200
um putting the plant into the

678
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:24,679
soil the clones have got the age though

679
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,759
of the mother so if the mother has been

680
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,600
cared for by your grower friend for a

681
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:34,079
year 6 months a year and a half

682
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,959
whatever your your clone is that age as

683
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,879
well and sometimes maybe it doesn't have

684
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,640
the same gunion as a younger plant from

685
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,278
seed will

686
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,759
have if you are interested in food

687
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:48,640
gardening already if you think you're

688
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:52,200
going to become a horiculture nerd as

689
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,720
well you may want to consider seeds and

690
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:59,080
here's the story on seeds seeds are

691
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,919
always going to be more robust and have

692
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:04,359
more Moy than a clone

693
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,320
does the pro the challenge anyway it's

694
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,798
not really a problem the challenge with

695
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,398
seeds though is number one you need to

696
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:15,960
go through the germination process and

697
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:17,798
it's not hard to germinate or pop seeds

698
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,600
and you can find tons of videos on how

699
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:23,480
to do this on YouTube um it's usually

700
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:26,638
some version of put it in a wet paper

701
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,679
towel until you start to see plant come

702
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:30,240
out

703
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,159
um some people like to put it in in a

704
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,000
cup of water for a few days and soak

705
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,360
them and then put them in paper towel

706
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,119
but there's a certain amount of risk

707
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,319
because once the once the seedling

708
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,798
starts to come out it's really easy to

709
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,278
dry them out so there are some initial

710
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:47,798
challenges in that category probably

711
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:49,558
more importantly though is is when

712
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:51,759
you're growing from seeds you don't know

713
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,038
if they're going to be male or female

714
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:57,158
and when growing cannabis we really only

715
00:31:54,038 --> 00:32:00,038
want to grow the females to get the

716
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:03,480
medicine from males are useful for

717
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:06,440
pollen if you want to create your own

718
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,440
crosses or create your own seeds and the

719
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:13,240
vime organization we keep a library of

720
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,480
males every year and uh we usually have

721
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,079
between 12 and 20 males and they're kept

722
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,200
at a viia member's house that is not

723
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:25,759
growing females that year and um and

724
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,159
when when they are full P we shake them

725
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,398
into little bags and the people who have

726
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,760
donated or said that they're going to

727
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,038
make seeds this year we give them a a

728
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,558
bag or or a little jar of pollen and

729
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:38,278
then they take a paintbrush and you can

730
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:41,398
paint it onto the flowers and you'll

731
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,919
cost seeds but generally speaking males

732
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:46,599
are not what you're going for you're

733
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,440
going for the females where the THC is

734
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:51,638
uh that you want for your relief or the

735
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,278
CBD so so you're going to have to get

736
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:55,359
educated on how to delineate the males

737
00:32:54,278 --> 00:32:58,960
from the

738
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,599
females which is super super easy with

739
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,759
10 years of

740
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:05,480
experience so

741
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:09,319
um again Google is really helpful in

742
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,960
this category um you know there good

743
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:13,839
cameras are everywhere now there are a

744
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,919
lot of people who are posting pictures

745
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:21,199
and videos about how to sex your plants

746
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,720
um it's just some time and some effort

747
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,319
and so if you want to go that extra step

748
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,679
um popping your own seeds can be a lot

749
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:34,439
of fun the plant that comes from them is

750
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,919
going to be more robust generally than

751
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,840
clones even though clones are plenty

752
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,278
robust you'll get a little bit more and

753
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,720
if you're the kind of person who likes

754
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,000
to jump in with two feet you may really

755
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,919
decide that you want to go with seeds

756
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,079
Plus for those of you who live on mashon

757
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:55,159
um we have got some fantastic seed

758
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,359
makers here on the island um including

759
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,399
if you if you already know in your head

760
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,678
that you're going to want to go with

761
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,119
seeds because because the jumping with

762
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,639
both feet is how is describing you

763
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,879
already um we've got our top seed

764
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:09,960
producer in the room so Michael raise

765
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,358
your hand so if you're interested in

766
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,760
seeds I asked Michael to bring seeds

767
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,960
with him tonight and and if you want to

768
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,119
talk with him um he'll be able to tell

769
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,878
you what what he's got available right

770
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:26,480
now and um and so if if you don't uh get

771
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,598
seeds tonight and you decide you want to

772
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,119
um even though it's illegal you can do

773
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,559
mail order and also if you have a

774
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,838
medical authorization they're now

775
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,440
selling them at many medical

776
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:40,078
dispensaries so again if you live on

777
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,480
Bashon also just like ask around there's

778
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,960
seeds all over the

779
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,240
place if you're drawing proce how long

780
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,039
does the plant need be grow before you

781
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:52,199
do the sex it sure um it won't be sexed

782
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:54,358
until just about the time it starts to

783
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,918
bloom because that's what's starting to

784
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:00,159
show right so you need to start growing

785
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,838
the pl and um I know you're going to do

786
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:05,440
indoor but for most of us who are

787
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:08,440
outdoor the the clock flips over um you

788
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,760
know in and around August 15th right so

789
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,400
depending on the cultivar bar some of

790
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,599
them start a little earlier some of them

791
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,079
start a little bit later but the moral

792
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,160
of the story is you won't know until mid

793
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:22,839
end of August generally speaking and so

794
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,759
so you're putting time and resource and

795
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:27,559
and and maybe repotting them up if

796
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,599
you've got a few just to decide that

797
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:32,480
you're going to either you know snip

798
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,400
them and throw them in the compost or uh

799
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,119
call me and add them to the the pollen

800
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,160
library for Vivia if you have on island

801
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:45,640
so question you can sex the seeds though

802
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:47,639
right so you can pay to have uh seeds

803
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:50,440
sexed but you can't do it yourself like

804
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:52,639
microscopic no I am aware of no way to

805
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,639
do that um there's new technologies from

806
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,118
Steep Hill labs in California where

807
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,318
they're doing genetics testing but for

808
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,599
the kind of price point that we're

809
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:04,800
talking about here tonight I I would not

810
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:08,640
consider that a realistic option yeah

811
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,640
so oh uh another option is um uh for

812
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,480
seeds and this is also where I'm going

813
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:16,159
to suggest that you can go for clones is

814
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,480
if you have a a medical authorization

815
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:23,039
you can go to the pce the patient

816
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,838
cannabis exchange uh that's in Tacoma on

817
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,679
Sundays it is one of the most wonderful

818
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:31,159
experiences that you will have as a

819
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:35,239
cannabis patient to go there and check

820
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:38,639
out this family environment of like 50

821
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:42,239
cannabis producers all sorts of flour

822
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,879
and Edibles and seeds and clones it's

823
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:48,199
like it's like Willy Wonka for

824
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,079
canis and um but you have to have a

825
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:52,480
medical authorization to go there and

826
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,359
that is the first place that I would

827
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,240
recommend that you go if you have an

828
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:57,519
authorization and if you want to work

829
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,759
from CL

830
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:04,400
um clones Northwest who has got a booth

831
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,839
there um they have fantastic clones um

832
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,960
they're very reasonably priced they

833
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:14,358
they've got a rotating list of of

834
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:16,639
strains every Sunday and uh 99% of the

835
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:18,759
time they're in great shape and and if

836
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,719
they're not in good shape um sometimes

837
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,160
we'll just give to so so I I can not

838
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:27,519
recommend going to the patient cannabis

839
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:30,118
exchange enough if you have an

840
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,960
authorization um if you don't have an

841
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,480
authorization uh this is where you need

842
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,199
to get a little bit more creative by

843
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,639
talking to your friends you know um if

844
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:39,639
you're here if you're interested in

845
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,838
cannabis you probably already know

846
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:44,879
somebody who's growing and if you are

847
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:48,199
let them know that you'd like to have a

848
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,760
clone from them in June and that gives

849
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,960
them enough time to make you a clone get

850
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,040
it rooted so that you're ready to go

851
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,720
outside and we'll talk about when to go

852
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,838
outside soon but generally speaking it's

853
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,318
um it's Mother's Day is kind of like

854
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,440
rule of thumb uh so so if somebody were

855
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:07,559
to start a clone for you now it would be

856
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:11,679
in great shape by by that

857
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:16,440
time um another opportunity is that um

858
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:20,159
uh the last viia meeting before the laws

859
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:23,039
change um here in Washington is going to

860
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,759
be uh June 15th and actually that's a

861
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,239
really awesome meeting to be at because

862
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,160
the fellow I was just talking about Tad

863
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,239
h

864
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:32,960
who did the the podcast with me on

865
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,159
building your own soil and wildcrafting

866
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,240
your own nutrient teas he's going to be

867
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,598
here talking live so so that's going to

868
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,479
be pretty awesome I'm actually really

869
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,480
excited about that myself he's got a

870
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:48,719
fantastic National reputation for all

871
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:52,960
natural organic growing and and um we

872
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:56,679
have also invited um two clone providers

873
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,400
uh to join us as well to provide so so

874
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,838
um you know maybe come back to the June

875
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,000
15th meeting as well and you may be able

876
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,000
to uh get a clone at that time as well

877
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,719
here I'm a little confused you generally

878
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:15,279
though you want your clone in the ground

879
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:18,838
on Mother's Day what was that piece so

880
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,480
um the the the important aspect is that

881
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:26,199
we need to have uh nighttime

882
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:29,679
temperatures above 50 every night and so

883
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:31,279
if the weather stays like this um people

884
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,318
will start going into the ground or

885
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,880
going outside as we say

886
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:39,400
earlier um The Challenge though is that

887
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,760
our Northwest weather is really fickle

888
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:46,480
and so if we have got a week like we

889
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,280
have had where you know evenings are 46

890
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,079
and today was like what 82 or something

891
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,720
ridiculous um people you know Growers on

892
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,720
the island are already starting to get

893
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:56,879
that kind of that itch you know where

894
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:59,919
they they're they're really really being

895
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,760
tempted to go outside but all it takes

896
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,720
is like you know 10 days from now we

897
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,960
could have 4 days in a row of low 40s

898
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,679
rain with morning fog and you're you

899
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,079
know you'll have wasted your efforts

900
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,399
because there's a really good chance

901
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,039
that your plant won't make it through

902
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,760
that unless you do something extra like

903
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,800
build a Clos or something like that or

904
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,800
you know some kind of a hold frame to

905
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,240
keep them warm at night so you know you

906
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,560
can you can buy yourself a little more

907
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,559
wiggle room with that but the the rule

908
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:30,599
of thumb is that you want your evenings

909
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:31,880
to stay above 50° and generally speaking

910
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,359
by Mother's Day you're in pretty good

911
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,358
shape for

912
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,960
that so the last thing I want to focus

913
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:45,078
in on on on the seeds versus clones and

914
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,679
choosing your plants is um sometimes you

915
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:50,560
just have to grow what's available if

916
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,559
your friend is growing three strains and

917
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,639
they're the ones who's going to be

918
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:55,480
giving you your clones you just need to

919
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:57,719
take what they've got and and this will

920
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,039
be you know you'll just go with that but

921
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,279
if you're going to order seeds or if

922
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,838
you're going to go to the patient

923
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,160
cannabis exchange or or if if you're

924
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:07,920
going to have some choice I encourage

925
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:11,078
you to choose something that has got a

926
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:15,760
as slow or as as short of a flowering

927
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:17,880
cycle as you can find um indicas

928
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,440
generally will have a flowering cycle

929
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,240
around eight uh 8 weeks if you get into

930
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,000
sativas which are more tropical you're

931
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:31,118
talking about 12 weeks

932
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,719
and and some of them like never and so

933
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,680
and so um but but again uh I had a lot

934
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,639
of luck last summer with a strain called

935
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:41,759
Shish Berry which claims to be finished

936
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:44,598
in six weeks and it was done for me in

937
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,720
six and a half weeks it was amazing and

938
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:51,680
so um the because of where we live if we

939
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,919
lived you know farther south um you we

940
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,598
would be able to grow more sativas and

941
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,119
we be able to finish without all the

942
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,318
covering as as much but you you

943
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,440
continually have to go farther south to

944
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,759
be growing sativa outdoors and that's

945
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,318
why Bashon has got the 30-year

946
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,240
reputation of of growing you know some

947
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:14,358
of the best Indica in the country

948
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:15,799
because that's all we do is Inda and and

949
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:18,639
a lot of the seeds that are produced on

950
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,480
the island year over year people are

951
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,598
picking their best plants and just

952
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,559
seeding the flowers on the bottom and so

953
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,720
year overy year the seeds get better and

954
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,640
better and better just for where we live

955
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,838
those same seeds are not going to be as

956
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,598
good if you take them down to Sona

957
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:39,880
County because the weather is different

958
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,318
there but but if you buy seeds on Bashon

959
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,838
that were produced on Bashon you're

960
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:48,079
going to be in a much uh better

961
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:50,558
situation so uh in summary try to get

962
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,240
the shortest flowering time as you

963
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,440
can when to plant so we've already hit

964
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:57,719
most of this already um you go try to go

965
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,960
outside at Mother's Day or if you're

966
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:04,959
feeling confident when you see um the

967
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,880
the evenings staying above 50 you know I

968
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,639
absolutely have put him out when I when

969
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,318
the evenings were 47 48 and hoped for

970
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:16,118
the best and some years I got the best

971
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,719
and some years I had to go get new

972
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:21,400
clothes and start and it's kind of a

973
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:24,039
crapshoot we all have got different risk

974
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,599
tolerance um but uh but that's what

975
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:29,440
we're looking for our our 50°

976
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:33,200
evenings

977
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,639
um some people also like to start them

978
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:39,279
indoors under a grow light now this is

979
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:41,000
not something you have to do but if you

980
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,880
think about it if there's two stages for

981
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,719
the plant if there is a vegetation stage

982
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,400
which is the plant trying to get as big

983
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:52,199
as it can before it changes its

984
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,240
priorities to making

985
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:57,399
flowers if you put your plant outside

986
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:00,759
you know at Mother's Day day you got

987
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,358
between then and around August 15th for

988
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,920
the vegetation stage and then the energy

989
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:09,239
is put in the flowers but if you were to

990
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:12,000
start now like many professional Growers

991
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:14,838
are you can start that plant under

992
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,960
lights and get it growing now and then

993
00:44:14,838 --> 00:44:19,759
when you put it out when the evening

994
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,639
temperatures are 50° you know it's

995
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,800
already this big and it goes outside and

996
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:28,598
then it just you know you are rewarded

997
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,480
for your efforts but your efforts look

998
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:34,838
like um you know either either

999
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,280
repurposing or buying uh a grow lamp and

1000
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,679
you know there are we can have a whole

1001
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,200
actually we have had a whole other

1002
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,480
evenings on lights and we're not talking

1003
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,919
about uh indoor growing specifically but

1004
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,280
you can really do a lot of good with

1005
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,358
just buying a decent plant grow light in

1006
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,440
the natural light spectrum from the

1007
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:58,598
hardware store and and you know you

1008
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,920
screw it in you put a couple starts

1009
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:02,599
under it um if you start them early

1010
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,079
enough and they get too big maybe you

1011
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,318
decide you want to get a second one but

1012
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:10,960
the goal here is that um uh you just

1013
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:13,679
want the plant to have an opportunity to

1014
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,519
get it start before you put it outside

1015
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,399
if you're going to go this this route um

1016
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:22,079
there's a lot of there's a lot of

1017
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,599
discussion about um how long to have the

1018
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,000
light on while it's in the house but

1019
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:31,160
suffice to say that if you have your

1020
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,960
light um on for 18 hours and off for 6

1021
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:37,279
hours you're in good shape um there are

1022
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,838
some people who will suggest you know 24

1023
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,280
hours of light to get all the growing

1024
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:44,078
you can and I've seen some amazing

1025
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,680
plants from 24 hours of life I also

1026
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,599
think it's it's not b i I think that

1027
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:50,879
it's really smart to give the the plant

1028
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,160
an opportunity to rest a few hours every

1029
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,880
night so just putting on putting it on a

1030
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:59,358
timer for 18 hours on 6 hours off

1031
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,440
and and doing that until you're ready to

1032
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:05,480
go outside um you can have your plant

1033
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,200
get a big jump on nature and and

1034
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:11,559
honestly you may you may increase the

1035
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:15,439
size of your plant by a third and you

1036
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:19,599
may increase your U your volume of

1037
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,039
flowers by as much as a half so you know

1038
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,400
if if you've got you know if you've got

1039
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:29,199
the 20 $30 to throw at just some simple

1040
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,079
uh plant lights at the hardware store um

1041
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:35,399
your your efforts will be

1042
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:39,559
rewarded so watering the goal with

1043
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,880
watering is to water the pot evenly I

1044
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:43,400
guess in this case I should say the soil

1045
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,119
evenly

1046
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,318
um but you also want the soil to have

1047
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:52,480
the opportunity to nearly dry out

1048
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:55,279
between waterings because that's how it

1049
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,960
is in nature the plant doesn't like its

1050
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,400
feet wet

1051
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:03,119
and there is a very prevalent philosophy

1052
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,920
that it's good to let your plant work a

1053
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,599
little bit you know give it a little bit

1054
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:13,480
of stress so that it feels like it has

1055
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:15,960
to earn its key right and so um uh the

1056
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,719
great way to water is is is you know

1057
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,920
water it enough that everything gets wet

1058
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,919
but not enough that you're that it's

1059
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,200
going to stay soaked necessarily for the

1060
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,920
rest of the day um the rule of thumb

1061
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:31,358
that my mentor has taught me and has

1062
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,920
worked out well for me is just plan on

1063
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:34,799
giving it a good solid watering once a

1064
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,240
day

1065
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:41,119
outdoors and if the weather is hot like

1066
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:45,519
it is today plan on watering it

1067
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:49,039
twice and if it's gray and kind of foggy

1068
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:51,159
or raining skip a day and if it's

1069
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,719
raining for 3 days in a row maybe just

1070
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:56,358
give it a little

1071
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:59,279
bit part of growing good cannabis

1072
00:47:56,358 --> 00:48:02,799
is developing a relationship with a

1073
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,000
plant so that you can listen to her she

1074
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,000
will tell you what she needs if she's

1075
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
starting to wilt chances are you're not

1076
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,318
giving her quite enough water there's a

1077
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,599
lot more other things there's a lot of

1078
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:16,239
other things that could be too but just

1079
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,920
generally speaking um if the leaves are

1080
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:19,879
starting to turn yellow chances are

1081
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,240
you're giving her too much water just

1082
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,200
like the rest of your house plant right

1083
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,399
so again um if you really want to dive

1084
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,239
into this

1085
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,400
you can Google watering cannabis plants

1086
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:35,519
and learn far more than we have the time

1087
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,200
to offer you here but the rule of thumb

1088
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,880
that will get you to a good harvest is

1089
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:43,118
just plan on giving it a good soaking

1090
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:46,318
once a day let the excess drain out the

1091
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:49,000
bottom of the pot and uh if it's hot

1092
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:53,719
water more and if it's our typical foggy

1093
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:57,719
rainy weak uh water

1094
00:48:53,719 --> 00:49:00,798
less when in doubt don't water and come

1095
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,439
back you know in 12 hours and check it

1096
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:06,599
again because it doesn't hurt to have

1097
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,119
the soil dry out some uh in nature it'll

1098
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:12,079
dry the soil will dry out regularly so

1099
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,200
the plants genetics are used to this

1100
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:18,000
what you don't want is the kind of dry

1101
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:21,039
where the soil detaches from the pop and

1102
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,239
you can start to see lines and you get

1103
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,798
the

1104
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:27,000
the kind of tubble weed that's that's

1105
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:29,239
that's not good because at that point

1106
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,039
you're going to start drying up your

1107
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:33,279
root system and you're going to start

1108
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,519
causing damage that may be irreparable

1109
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:40,079
so there you go

1110
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:42,480
blooming so depending on your uh the

1111
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,240
cultivar that you end up with the

1112
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,199
blooming will start somewhere around

1113
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:50,719
August 15th because nature goes to 12

1114
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:53,399
hours of daylight 12 hours of

1115
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,798
Darkness um it would be at this point if

1116
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,798
you are choosing to purchase Bloom

1117
00:49:55,798 --> 00:50:00,440
nutrients you're going to want to start

1118
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:02,559
adding this properly to your water some

1119
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,880
of the blooming nutrients are called to

1120
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,480
to put them on the soil and put a little

1121
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,280
soil on top and then water that but some

1122
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,039
of them are are add to water as well so

1123
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,480
if you're going to add Bloom nutrients

1124
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:17,920
now is the time to start that and this

1125
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,240
is also when your plant is going to

1126
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,159
start to

1127
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:24,719
stank and some people don't like the

1128
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:27,318
smell of cannabis and for them my heart

1129
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:30,159
goes out

1130
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:32,759
I love the smell of a really stinky

1131
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:35,039
cannabis plant the same way that I love

1132
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,720
the smell of a really stinky cheese that

1133
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:40,880
smells like baby diaper

1134
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:44,279
right that smell though as the plant

1135
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,640
blooms is going to get more and more

1136
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,680
potent and this brings us back around to

1137
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,318
the conversation about your neighbors

1138
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:54,118
right so so since we're talking about

1139
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:55,639
your growing for your personal use we're

1140
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,880
probably only talking about a few few

1141
00:50:55,639 --> 00:51:00,159
plants here and if we're talking about a

1142
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,119
patient legally in Washington we're only

1143
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,558
talking about four unless you're under

1144
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:06,920
registry then you're up to six or

1145
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,119
15 however you know if you're if you're

1146
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,920
doing well and if your plant is is

1147
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,798
having some success um it especially if

1148
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,920
you've got a smelly strain say for

1149
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:18,880
example

1150
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,680
skull um you want to be aware that your

1151
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,280
plants are good to smell and so uh

1152
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:26,279
consider that when you when you're

1153
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,680
choosing the part of your yard and also

1154
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,680
consider that because it's going to be

1155
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:33,960
really fun it's it is my personal

1156
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:35,159
favorite part even more than harvesting

1157
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,599
because harvesting means I'm going to

1158
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:42,798
have to trim um uh when the plants start

1159
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:46,200
to smell and give off their unique

1160
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:49,119
turfing profile it is Nature's aroma

1161
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,960
therapy and and you know you will feel

1162
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,640
Joy in your heart and you will know

1163
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,960
you're having success and there is a

1164
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:58,199
certain connection with nature when you

1165
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,400
start to smell that that that you just

1166
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:02,399
don't get anywhere else than than from

1167
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,440
smelling flowers which is why we give

1168
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,960
them in Romance right so so once

1169
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,318
blooming starts um you will notice that

1170
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:14,720
the that the the size of the plant will

1171
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:17,480
slow down in its increase and you will

1172
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:21,078
start to see either sex if you're coming

1173
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:23,240
from um seeds um or if you're coming

1174
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,680
from a clone uh you know you we should

1175
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,879
be darn well guaranteed that it's a

1176
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:28,598
female

1177
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:32,519
and so um you will start to see the

1178
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:35,119
blooms um uh start at the nodules where

1179
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:37,400
the branches are meeting the uh the main

1180
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,400
stock so right nestled in here you'll

1181
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,480
start to see flowers all the way down

1182
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:44,119
the Plant and at the beginning all they

1183
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,760
are these like little tiny usually white

1184
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:51,559
hairs um but that is a that's a promise

1185
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:53,680
of future awesomeness so so um so so

1186
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:57,440
that'll happen around August and that is

1187
00:52:53,679 --> 00:53:00,159
when um if you know what your your

1188
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,280
strain or cultivar is I recommend that

1189
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:06,199
you Google it say for example um it's

1190
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:10,760
blue dream go ahead and Google blue

1191
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:13,838
dream strain flowering time and find out

1192
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:16,559
what the flowering time is for the the

1193
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:18,719
plant that you're working with um it'll

1194
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,040
tell you how many days sometimes it'll

1195
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:25,798
just tell you round it out to weeks but

1196
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:29,079
from uh August 15th put on your calendar

1197
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:31,400
forward that long and that will give you

1198
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:32,720
an approximation of when your plant is

1199
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,358
going to be done we'll talk about

1200
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,558
harvesting more in a minute but that'll

1201
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:38,039
give you a general idea and the reason

1202
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,880
why I suggest you put it on your

1203
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:44,440
calendar is number one it will help you

1204
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:48,119
be patient during that time and it will

1205
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:50,639
it will help you resist harvesting early

1206
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,519
because when the plant starts smelling

1207
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:55,318
potent and when you see it and the

1208
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:57,358
weather report starts getting worse

1209
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:59,920
you're going to be tempted to Har to

1210
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:02,719
harvest it early and you really don't

1211
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:06,079
want to do that because the THC sets in

1212
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:09,239
the plant just in the last few weeks you

1213
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:12,839
know the CBD in the plant it sets in

1214
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:15,118
about 2 to 3 weeks earlier than the THC

1215
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:17,279
does so so you know for commercial

1216
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,318
Growers who are growing indoors you can

1217
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,240
actually cut off a crop early if you're

1218
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:23,358
just going for the CBD and over the

1219
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,358
course of a year you can get work in

1220
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:30,159
actually an extra crop but we're talking

1221
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:33,920
about growing outdoors and so um uh you

1222
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:38,759
want to be able to let it go its entire

1223
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:42,599
length how do you decide when to

1224
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:47,920
harvest the best way I know is to spend

1225
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:52,680
eight bucks on eBay and pick up a 30X

1226
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:56,200
and a 30X jewelers loop l

1227
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:59,078
o you can also use a 30X magnifying

1228
00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:03,439
glass what you'll find on the flowers

1229
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:06,720
are these little stocks that are called

1230
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,358
troms inside the tricomes is the

1231
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:14,679
cannabis oil which is the goal of all of

1232
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:18,000
this and if you've got your little Loop

1233
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:19,798
you get on in there and for the whole

1234
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,039
first part of the blooming cycle you

1235
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:25,599
will see these stocks but they'll be

1236
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,480
first they'll just be small and clear

1237
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,680
and then they'll get taller and clearer

1238
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,719
and then they'll be taller with a kind

1239
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:36,239
of a bulb on the top and be

1240
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:38,118
clear and then they'll start to get a

1241
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,279
little cloudy or

1242
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:42,318
milky and that's when you want to start

1243
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,039
paying attention and then they will

1244
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:46,759
start to turn

1245
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:50,559
Amber there is a lot of different

1246
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:52,960
opinions on once it turns Amber what to

1247
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:56,798
do some will say the whole plant should

1248
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,280
be Amber some will say say as soon as it

1249
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:01,318
starts getting

1250
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:04,039
Amber I kind of like to pull a tweener

1251
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:09,440
it's always a judgment call but when

1252
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:11,280
when some of the tricomes are Amber I go

1253
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:17,159
ahead and harvest at that point they may

1254
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:19,559
not all be but on Vashon where we are

1255
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:22,159
fighting the

1256
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,240
weather if if if a good group of your

1257
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:26,399
tricomes are Amber and the rest are

1258
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:29,239
cloudy and about to become Amber you

1259
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,280
should just cut and run because you have

1260
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:33,879
got CBD that's sitting in the plant

1261
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,119
ready to go you've got your txc that's

1262
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,400
sitting in the plant and is ready to go

1263
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:42,039
and it's time to just go ahead and cut

1264
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:45,000
it without magnification it's very

1265
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:48,079
challenging to decide when to harvest

1266
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,440
the plant if you really don't want to

1267
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,798
spend the eight bucks or ask your friend

1268
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,039
to borrow their magnifying glass you can

1269
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:57,519
just Harvest based on the the

1270
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,240
recommendations blindly um you're

1271
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:01,480
probably going to leave some tricomes on

1272
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:03,479
the table though and I recommend that if

1273
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,519
you're going to go through this and put

1274
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,679
all of your time and effort and love

1275
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:11,440
into this plant then you go ahead and

1276
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:14,480
pick up a $8 with free shipping jewelers

1277
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,838
loop on eBay um plus once you have it

1278
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,880
you'll be surprised how many other cool

1279
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,639
things that you can use it for it's CU

1280
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:24,000
kind of cool to have around the house um

1281
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:27,118
it's amazing to look at bugs so yes

1282
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,280
about so looking at the tricomes um so

1283
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:33,640
you it sounds like you're talking about

1284
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,720
looking at them for their uh THC content

1285
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:38,639
like that the Amber it means that this

1286
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:40,639
the THC is going to be higher correct so

1287
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,239
if you're just looking to harvest for

1288
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:45,239
more more for

1289
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:49,318
CBD what will the tricomes be an

1290
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:53,038
indicator of will that help sure so so

1291
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:55,239
it's kind of a Sticky Wicket here so um

1292
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,799
if you have a strain that's going to and

1293
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:00,159
you're not growing for THC at all let's

1294
00:57:57,798 --> 00:58:03,159
say let's say that you are growing for

1295
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:05,000
seizures and you want some THC in there

1296
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:07,199
to take advantage of the Entourage

1297
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,960
effect the whole plant medicine aspect

1298
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:15,279
of it right um You

1299
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:18,039
can um Harvest you know a week to two

1300
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:21,559
earlier than recommended and there will

1301
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:24,520
absolutely be CBD matured in the

1302
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:26,680
plant it's a kind of a dangerous game

1303
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:28,798
and it's that is usually something that

1304
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:31,199
I would only recommend for professionals

1305
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,199
who are familiar with their strain that

1306
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,679
said if you're about to leave on

1307
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:37,838
vacation or if the weather is just about

1308
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,440
to go to hell you know and you're only

1309
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:42,519
looking really for the

1310
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:45,880
CBD um yeah there a case could be made

1311
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:48,880
to to U Harvest a week or two early and

1312
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,280
neglect a lot of the THC in most cases

1313
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,039
though we're going even if you're going

1314
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:55,200
to get a CBD plant you do want some

1315
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:58,960
amount of THC in there and you don't

1316
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:02,838
want to end up with with it um not matur

1317
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:06,838
so so I would still go to let the

1318
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:09,519
tricomes become Amber um but you got

1319
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:13,239
more room to cut early if you're just

1320
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:16,000
going for the CBD but but really um as

1321
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:19,479
far as as far as the general rule it's

1322
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,199
going to be when when when some of the

1323
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:27,159
tricomes are fully Amber cut and pull

1324
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:27,159
inside especially it's going to rain

1325
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:34,920
tomorrow so so so now it's time to

1326
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,519
harvest and uh for many this is

1327
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,240
bittersweet because you've had this

1328
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:42,679
relationship with this plant all summer

1329
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:45,759
and and now uh it's time to end it and

1330
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:48,318
so um uh people have got different ways

1331
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,880
they like to do it some folks like to go

1332
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:53,239
starting at the bottom and and cutting

1333
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,599
up the plant just cut off Branch Branch

1334
00:59:53,239 --> 01:00:01,239
Branch branch and just kind of set them

1335
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:03,920
aside um I learned from uh from Alex um

1336
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:07,038
from Solstice who spoke last fall here

1337
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,599
on harvesting and curing Al [ __ ] he

1338
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,400
said that he that his team always

1339
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:13,000
harvests from the bottom in case there's

1340
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,480
any mold on the plant which we'll talk

1341
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,119
about a little bit later he'll cut and

1342
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,400
the mold Falls and then he goes higher

1343
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,400
the cut and the molds Falls whereas if

1344
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,200
you start at the top and you cut if

1345
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,079
there's any mold up there it drops down

1346
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:28,558
on the lower plant so by time you're at

1347
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:30,480
the bottom any mold that's above has has

1348
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,920
come down on the lower so always start

1349
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,920
at your

1350
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,159
bottom um the other way to do it and and

1351
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,119
a lot of folks do this if they don't

1352
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:41,318
have a lot of room to hang their plant

1353
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,960
which we'll discuss in a minute is just

1354
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:46,159
take some big Cutters and and cut the

1355
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,960
stock if you've been really successful

1356
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:51,679
you may not be able to cut it just with

1357
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:55,280
pruners you may need um a

1358
01:00:51,679 --> 01:01:00,239
hacksaw one way or another um you need

1359
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:03,039
to uh cut it and hang it um you've got

1360
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:06,399
uh at least two options at that

1361
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:09,160
point actually this uh this wire here is

1362
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,200
perfect for hanging Canada scrub um it's

1363
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:13,399
wire so it's not going to have much Bend

1364
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,358
to it I don't recommend you hanging on

1365
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:19,000
string because

1366
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:23,279
string right so hanging on uh wire or

1367
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,039
cable or um or or a a type of of taut

1368
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,960
filament is a good way

1369
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:31,079
ago um uh one of my friends who's on the

1370
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,838
island who's a retired Professor um he

1371
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:35,480
doesn't like cutting all of his

1372
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:38,000
individual branches because it fills up

1373
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:40,119
too much space so what he does is he's

1374
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,318
got a a cable that's already run in his

1375
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:46,680
garage he just cuts the whole plant and

1376
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:49,279
he hangs the whole plant all in one and

1377
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:51,960
every summer he just does five plants so

1378
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,599
he's got 1 2 3 four five done and

1379
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,880
they're all hung at the same time and

1380
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:58,760
and uh and then he he trims off that

1381
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,720
which we'll talk about minut yes uh

1382
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,119
prior to harvesting you sto fertilizing

1383
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:05,838
the plant a few couple weeks before

1384
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,880
that's excellent so it should be on the

1385
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:11,239
instructions of your Bloom fertilizer

1386
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,960
about how many weeks to do this but

1387
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:16,479
generally since we're going to be uh

1388
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:19,838
consuming it uh folks recommend that you

1389
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,760
stop fertilizing at least 2 weeks before

1390
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:24,759
um and then at that point you do what's

1391
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:27,319
consider called a flush and so you're

1392
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:30,480
just you're just watering it to flush

1393
01:02:27,318 --> 01:02:34,038
out the nutrients in the soil and uh so

1394
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:36,480
that um it gives you an even taste and

1395
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:37,720
um and you don't waste nutrients a great

1396
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,480
question I wasn't going to mention that

1397
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:43,358
so good call thank you

1398
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,119
um so the room that you're hanging in

1399
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:48,199
this is probably going to be a punt for

1400
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,880
most everybody um uh there's some

1401
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:55,919
differentiation about humidity in a in a

1402
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:59,400
in a in a drying room uh 62 % humidity

1403
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,200
is is often what's gone for uh if it's

1404
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,760
if it's less humid your plant will dry

1405
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:06,519
faster and The Taste will develop a

1406
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:09,760
little less if it's more humid it may

1407
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:12,318
never dry but really most since the the

1408
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,640
most important aspects are cool and dark

1409
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:17,358
you may not have a choice so you might

1410
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:20,838
just put it in your cool dark place you

1411
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:23,119
have um because even if it dries

1412
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:25,038
quickly um you know it's not like the

1413
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,200
it's not like it's going to be ruined

1414
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:32,200
um it would be you know Troublesome if

1415
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:35,639
your goal was to sell it um and people

1416
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:38,038
have got really high standards for flour

1417
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:41,679
now but but since we're talking about

1418
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:43,960
growing for yourself if you just hang it

1419
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:46,159
in a room that is dark and cool you're

1420
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,519
probably going to be in good shape if

1421
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:51,798
you really want to get dirdy about it go

1422
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:54,798
ahead and Google drawing cannabis and

1423
01:03:51,798 --> 01:03:57,679
you'll get a exhaustive conversation

1424
01:03:54,798 --> 01:04:00,119
on on different techniques um but for

1425
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:03,318
for this what we want you to do is just

1426
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:07,480
hang it to the point that the

1427
01:04:03,318 --> 01:04:11,000
branches when you bend them they

1428
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:14,440
snap if you bend them and they Bend it's

1429
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,798
not ready yet if you bend it and it

1430
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:20,880
snaps you're good to go to the next

1431
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:24,278
stage I have a question about I know

1432
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:28,400
it's but uh I have a b po occasionally

1433
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:31,358
and uh I put it in a dehydrator M and

1434
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:34,798
you know I you to sell it it really

1435
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:37,318
saves you know I mean it seemed like it

1436
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:39,798
was okay is that a rough thing on the

1437
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:42,358
THC or is there any other other than

1438
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:46,159
maybe problem

1439
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:49,480
thatat yeah so so I have absolutely

1440
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:53,118
heard of folks dehydrating but with the

1441
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,798
heat off so they're dehydrating with

1442
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,200
just the air blowing

1443
01:04:54,798 --> 01:05:01,119
around um normally that's not going to

1444
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:03,679
be um efficient enough though because

1445
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:06,000
most dehydrators are pretty small but if

1446
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:09,118
you're if you if you only have a couple

1447
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,159
plants and you've got a big dehydrator

1448
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,000
um I don't see any reason why you

1449
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:16,798
couldn't go in that way well by last

1450
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,679
year buil insulating right with that 2

1451
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:23,599
in R insulation and built a 4x4 box and

1452
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:25,318
put a dehydrator inside it and it

1453
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,559
actually work really well see that kind

1454
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:29,679
of mad science works all the time right

1455
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:32,760
like you know and see and so that is a

1456
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:35,399
perfect example right you can you can

1457
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:38,119
chop it hang it in your garage come back

1458
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,200
in two weeks after checking on it every

1459
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:43,039
day right and you're done boom right it

1460
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:47,239
can be that simple or you can do this

1461
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:51,640
kind of mad science and and have it dry

1462
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:54,719
at a slower rate and and as it slows at

1463
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:56,759
a as it as it dries at a slower rate

1464
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,278
um The Taste I actually don't know the

1465
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,160
theot of it but but the the tastes are

1466
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:04,920
able to develop and mature in a way that

1467
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,118
doesn't happen when it gets dry really

1468
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:09,240
quickly you want to know why that is

1469
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,960
yeah so it's about the plant material

1470
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:12,759
it's not about the troms or any of the

1471
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,639
Turpin or anything like that it's

1472
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,278
actually the Vegeta PL material much the

1473
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:20,480
way that they cure tobacco in a in a

1474
01:06:17,278 --> 01:06:23,159
slow way is that if if you dry that

1475
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,159
plant material very quickly it'll burn

1476
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:26,920
quickly and it'll be like harsh but if

1477
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:28,759
you cure it in that slow way and you

1478
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,798
remove the most moisture slowly the

1479
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,880
vegetative part of the pan will burn

1480
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:35,880
more slowly and it'll smoo the burn and

1481
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:40,599
it preserves like the moisture in

1482
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:42,798
the so so more taste less off right sh

1483
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:44,838
it's also a conversion of of starches

1484
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,318
into sugars and that's part of that part

1485
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:48,038
of that process of the plant still

1486
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:50,558
thinking it's alive during the first few

1487
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:53,240
days after's been cut so it actually

1488
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,359
still thinks is alive so it eats itself

1489
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:57,159
of its star and those starches get

1490
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,920
combined sugars and those sugars are

1491
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:00,960
actually what gives a marijuana better

1492
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,278
flavor use a dehydrator something like

1493
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,278
that sometimes you can pull some of

1494
01:07:02,278 --> 01:07:07,318
those sugars out too quickly yeah right

1495
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:09,559
thank you Joshua and like I said when I

1496
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:11,838
started the room is filled with Growers

1497
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:15,720
who know more than I do right Josh being

1498
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:18,558
one of them and and and um as much as

1499
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:21,558
you want to get into this growing

1500
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:24,359
unfolds itself and and you can learn

1501
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:26,119
more which which I continue to do yes

1502
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:28,558
are they talking about

1503
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:34,400
dehumidifiers uh no like a dehydrator

1504
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:34,400
like to make like beef jerky or or or

1505
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:40,480
just a food dehydrator it's a it's a

1506
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,960
small box and it's got shelves that pull

1507
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,639
out right okay a heat Source yeah yeah

1508
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,838
exactly and so if you're going to use

1509
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:48,519
for cannabis though most everybody

1510
01:07:46,838 --> 01:07:51,078
detaches the heat Source cuz you don't

1511
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:53,519
want you put a de humidifier in in your

1512
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:56,359
garage or shop um that would probably

1513
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:58,759
take a humidity too low yeah cuz idea

1514
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:00,480
like you saiding moist out of the yeah I

1515
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,000
think I think well if if you've got

1516
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,519
really high humidity in you might need a

1517
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
dehumidifier to bring it down some but

1518
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:10,759
just be careful because um in my

1519
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,358
experience dehumidifiers you know cuz

1520
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,119
because we'll use them in the grow room

1521
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:16,759
so that the grow room doesn't get like

1522
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:19,480
indoors so it doesn't get too moist but

1523
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:21,838
but um you're kind of playing with fire

1524
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:24,559
doing that in your in your curing closet

1525
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,679
because um if you're humid is on too

1526
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,920
long it'll pull all the moisture out of

1527
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:31,920
the air and then they'll get really

1528
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:35,560
rigid really faster what about how books

1529
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,480
in your curing closet does that help the

1530
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,159
community I don't have any experience

1531
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:40,919
about the books I would avoid books in

1532
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:44,479
my curing closet just because of

1533
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:47,158
potential mold risk yeah yeah Adam um is

1534
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,798
there a level approximately around like

1535
01:08:47,158 --> 01:08:50,198
humidity level in a drying room where

1536
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:53,079
you do need to start worrying about

1537
01:08:50,198 --> 01:08:54,838
facilitating mold growth and whatnot

1538
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:57,679
like a percentage like you know if it's

1539
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:59,880
like like how much over 62% humidity in

1540
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,158
that drying curing room could start you

1541
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:04,880
know contributing to too much moisture

1542
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,479
and like you know mold or whatnot you

1543
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,640
know the short answer is I don't have a

1544
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:12,238
good answer for you the longer answer

1545
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:15,798
though is that um even at 62° or excuse

1546
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,198
me 62% you are still going to be dealing

1547
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:19,560
you know if there's mold on the plant

1548
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:22,960
that you're bringing in um it's going to

1549
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:25,319
continue being mold once once the plant

1550
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:28,520
is molded it should be thrown away so if

1551
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:32,400
you see mold on your plant don't bring

1552
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:34,159
that mold into your dry room cut it off

1553
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,559
and and leave it outside somewhere

1554
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:38,679
because you don't want to bring those

1555
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,080
spores into the the drawing room where

1556
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:44,640
it can contaminate the other

1557
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:44,640
plants so

1558
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:52,880
um so let's talk a little bit about

1559
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:54,760
mold this is a mold is a bane of growing

1560
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,039
in the northwest

1561
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:59,800
and there are two primary kinds of mold

1562
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:03,238
that are we have to deal with um the

1563
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:06,719
first and most common is powdery mildew

1564
01:10:03,238 --> 01:10:09,119
powdery mildew is um it is looks like

1565
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:13,198
white splotches on the

1566
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:16,760
leaves and it makes grown men

1567
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,960
cry um there are really uh you know you

1568
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,480
you can you can Google online for

1569
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:24,679
powdery Milo sprays and people will give

1570
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:26,799
you all sorts of amazing concoctions

1571
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:29,279
that they think works for them to make a

1572
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:32,119
long story short though um the choice

1573
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:35,519
for many is either you rub it off with

1574
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:39,079
your hands and then you rub your hands

1575
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,840
on um a disinfectant and then you

1576
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:43,960
continue to rub it down the Plant where

1577
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:46,520
you see it or a lot of people just once

1578
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:48,760
there's powdery mildew on the leaf they

1579
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,719
don't want it it becomes you know as if

1580
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:53,000
it was a contagion and they just remove

1581
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,920
the the the leaf from the plant if

1582
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,880
you've got a serious powdery mildew

1583
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,158
problem though you could be taking a lot

1584
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,560
of leaves from the plant and there are

1585
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:03,359
definitely two different schools of

1586
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,320
thought one is that it's not a big deal

1587
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:08,039
to take plants off or take leaves off

1588
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:10,759
the plant especially in bloom because

1589
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:12,640
why bother to grow to keep that leaf

1590
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,679
alive and then some people think that

1591
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,280
every time you take a leaf you are

1592
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:19,000
causing stress to the

1593
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:20,920
plant if you don't have a huge powdery

1594
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,920
mildew problem and you've got a lot of

1595
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,960
leaves I think there's a strong case to

1596
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:28,039
be made to just remove the

1597
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:31,119
leaf if your plant is being taken over

1598
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:32,519
by Pottery mildew at that point um

1599
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:34,519
you're probably going to want to look

1600
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,760
into just spraying it and just trying to

1601
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,480
do whatever you can to save the

1602
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,000
plant the second kind of build do or the

1603
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:43,439
second time of mold that we have that's

1604
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,880
a real drag is called

1605
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:49,919
buritis and buritis um manifests in two

1606
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:52,800
different ways the first is um it will

1607
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,960
be at the crown uh of the flower right

1608
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,679
at the very top at the tip and you can

1609
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,960
start to see it get gray and fuzzy

1610
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,679
that's a drag but at least you see it

1611
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,480
the other way is it will be in the very

1612
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:08,000
core of the flower so you'll grow this

1613
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:09,799
beautiful flower and you're like yeah

1614
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,319
and then you break it open and it's all

1615
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,840
fuzzy and you can't smoke it anymore

1616
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:16,439
it's it's no good for you it's terrible

1617
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,239
for a patient and and it's really sad

1618
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:20,839
and and why it's even worse where we

1619
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:25,599
live is because while we try to keep a

1620
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:29,639
trius out of our crops they spray btis

1621
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:33,000
in Oregon for their late bottled vintage

1622
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:35,960
reings and Ice wines because it causes

1623
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,880
them to uh mature in taste and

1624
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:43,560
mold so um so that blows up here so we

1625
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:47,079
have got a a really serious betrus issue

1626
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:50,360
and you should expect to lose um you

1627
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:54,850
know a percentage of your crop to mold

1628
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:57,880
just because of where we live so plantet

1629
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:59,880
[Music]

1630
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:02,960
all right

1631
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,600
so in summary let's let's let's rewind

1632
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,880
it back to the

1633
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:09,159
beginning so you're going

1634
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,440
to figure out what your kind of soil

1635
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:13,599
you're you're going to have you're going

1636
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:15,559
to pick the area in your garden and you

1637
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,880
are going to get your hands on either a

1638
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:20,560
seeds or a clone you're going to plant

1639
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:23,079
it all up together you're going to go

1640
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:26,120
through your vegetation period which is

1641
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:28,679
going to allow your plant to grow up

1642
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:30,158
large August 15th is going to come

1643
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:32,600
you're going to start seeing flowers

1644
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:34,719
come on it's going to start to

1645
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,480
smell you're going to reach the point

1646
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:39,079
that some of the tricomes are starting

1647
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:41,479
to turn Amber or are Amber you're going

1648
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:42,880
to harvest you're going to hang it and

1649
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:47,238
you're going to let it

1650
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:49,560
dry once it's dry you want to there's a

1651
01:13:47,238 --> 01:13:53,678
there's a preference you can either trim

1652
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:56,600
the flowers of uh down uh of the their

1653
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,800
small leaves Sugar Leaf we'll call it uh

1654
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,520
to make them pretty when they're wet

1655
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,159
some people like to do it and you drop

1656
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:05,800
it in a jar and some people like to wait

1657
01:14:03,158 --> 01:14:08,479
until it's dry um we don't have enough

1658
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:11,400
time to go into that right now um

1659
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:14,678
suffice to say though that

1660
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:17,719
um once it is dry enough in the curing

1661
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:21,800
process that it the the the branch

1662
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:24,000
snaps it should go into uh glass jars

1663
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,679
like a mason jar

1664
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,520
for about two

1665
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,719
weeks and open it once a day and let the

1666
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,880
air

1667
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:36,920
exchange because what you're doing is

1668
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:38,480
the the drying that you are done in your

1669
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:42,039
room to the

1670
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:43,718
snap that's that's that's the the main

1671
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:48,399
part of the drawing once you bring it

1672
01:14:43,719 --> 01:14:51,679
into glass jars you are now slowing down

1673
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:53,920
that uh process to to its end so that

1674
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,440
the last of the starches convert to

1675
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,279
sugars and you get a finished product

1676
01:14:56,439 --> 01:15:01,559
that is very pleasant to smoke there are

1677
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:04,158
a lot of different strategies for how to

1678
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:06,159
do this there really isn't a way to do

1679
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:09,559
it wrong by the time you're putting your

1680
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:12,119
flowers in the jar you've already won

1681
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:15,679
and we're talking about differentiation

1682
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:18,000
of taste at that point and over time

1683
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:20,239
over talking with other Growers if you

1684
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,359
want to do some more research online you

1685
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:25,079
will get more sophisticated in how you

1686
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:26,920
do that but but in a beginner's course

1687
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:29,479
if if if you get through this whole

1688
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,639
process and you've hung it and you get

1689
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:35,238
them into jars and you're opening the

1690
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:38,600
jars once a day for two weeks what you

1691
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:41,359
have there is a huge success you can

1692
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,239
take that and you can smoke it for pain

1693
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:45,799
you can make tinctures if you prefer not

1694
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:48,359
to smoke and use that on a wide range of

1695
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,600
issues you can turn it into oil and use

1696
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:52,920
it in Edibles you have won you've

1697
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:55,480
already won at that point so from that

1698
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,639
point on the next year you're just going

1699
01:15:55,479 --> 01:16:00,439
to be fine

1700
01:15:56,639 --> 01:16:03,960
tuning so so with that that is what I

1701
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:06,960
have we've got about uh about 10 minutes

1702
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:09,039
for for questions if you have them and

1703
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,039
because like I already said I am not the

1704
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:15,079
best grower in the room I'm just the one

1705
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:16,960
doing the beginners part uh forew um we

1706
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:18,679
might we might share some answers too

1707
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,880
from the more uh professional folks in

1708
01:16:18,679 --> 01:16:24,600
the room so so who has a question yeah

1709
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:27,880
are you friends by all while

1710
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:29,440
you're or you just letting them go uh so

1711
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,359
so there is some difference opinion

1712
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:32,119
about whether or not you're going to

1713
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:34,880
prune them uh you're definitely not

1714
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:37,920
going to uh prune branches because

1715
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,800
they've got flowers on them uh uh well

1716
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,119
into the bloom cycle some people will

1717
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:44,440
like the idea of taking off some of the

1718
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:46,399
extra branches with that either don't

1719
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:48,839
have flowers or have got like emaciated

1720
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:51,519
flowers so that the plant can continue

1721
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:53,520
to put its energy into the robust

1722
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,560
flowers um some people people think that

1723
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,880
that stresses out the plant so it's

1724
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:01,920
certainly a debatable issue I do like

1725
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:04,400
like prune to get off um the fluff right

1726
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,520
and I and I move on but but really uh I

1727
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:09,238
don't really think there's the right

1728
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:11,400
answer it's a technique yes yeah um what

1729
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:12,879
about hours of sunshine when you're

1730
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:14,238
trying to decide where you're going to

1731
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:18,760
place your

1732
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:20,839
pots all you can get so so yeah because

1733
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:23,719
really the the more Sunshine that your

1734
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:25,639
plant gets during the day the more or

1735
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:28,719
you know it can do photosynthesis and

1736
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:30,199
take care of itself um if you have got a

1737
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,079
place in your property that's going to

1738
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:34,599
be shaded most of the day that's

1739
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:38,840
definitely not where you want to go and

1740
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:42,480
if you're going to um uh you know if you

1741
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:44,719
got a a a a Southwest facing side of

1742
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:46,439
your house that would be a really great

1743
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:49,119
place because not only do you get all

1744
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:51,960
the the the day sunshine but you get all

1745
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:53,920
the reflected Sunshine off of wall and

1746
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,119
and also at at the end of day when

1747
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,679
you're getting that awesome end of day

1748
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:00,039
bash on light the the the house will

1749
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:02,560
still be warm which will keep the

1750
01:18:00,039 --> 01:18:05,198
ambient temperature up high but but

1751
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,360
really your goal is to be in as much sun

1752
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:10,879
every

1753
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:13,039
day yes say got the some other plants

1754
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,039
that I like the strains and they're

1755
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:16,960
they're they're doing really well and

1756
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,920
they they live like maybe a year like

1757
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:22,158
you were saying year and a

1758
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:24,760
half how is it like converting them to

1759
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,759
seed producers at the end of that cycle

1760
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:30,639
do they are they still strong enough to

1761
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:32,360
do that or in my experience yes um

1762
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:34,000
you'll just want to uh you know you can

1763
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:36,719
either put him in a room or put him next

1764
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:40,399
to a guy or you can get pollen out of

1765
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:43,960
the viia pollen library and um and then

1766
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:46,238
paint them on but um while this is not

1767
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:48,079
my specialty I don't think that I mean

1768
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:51,678
people put their mothers seed all the

1769
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:54,119
time okay yeah are you with that Jake

1770
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:58,960
yeah all right cool

1771
01:18:54,119 --> 01:19:02,119
yeah when PL done to seed is the flower

1772
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,520
useless for smoking no definitely not as

1773
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:05,920
a matter of fact some of the coolest

1774
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,760
gifts I've been given U by professional

1775
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:11,600
Growers is a is a little paper envelope

1776
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:13,800
with a seated flower in it because it

1777
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,600
kind of gives you a sample of what it is

1778
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,279
right so you just simply you know use

1779
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,280
your thumbs and get the seeds out and

1780
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:22,119
then you smoke what's left and so um uh

1781
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:23,880
you know traditionally people will

1782
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:26,519
complain about because you don't want to

1783
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,079
get in the bowl they'll pop they they

1784
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,800
they do you know the energy from the

1785
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,198
plant will be taken from flower

1786
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:34,320
production into seed production so

1787
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:36,799
you're it's not going to be quite the

1788
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:39,719
you know the Burly THC as you would get

1789
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,960
if if the plant wasn't seated but if

1790
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:44,800
your goal is to produce seeds for the

1791
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,719
next year go ahead see the plant pull

1792
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,119
out the seeds and then just you know me

1793
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:52,600
it's not be pretty anymore but um it's

1794
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:54,719
it makes a great joint yeah so you said

1795
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:57,760
um that with the doctor's form you can

1796
01:19:54,719 --> 01:20:01,639
do 15 plants is that per parcel or per

1797
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,639
patient per parcel

1798
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:11,719
okay analyze parel thank you uh well on

1799
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:14,480
the keing county um partial viewer one

1800
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:17,039
number you know so it could be 100 acres

1801
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:19,279
or it can be a quarter Acres correct

1802
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:22,359
don't run your Parcels together into one

1803
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:25,479
parcel well and see the other great area

1804
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:26,920
is um there is there they're still

1805
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:30,198
hashing this out but there's going to be

1806
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:33,520
room for patient collectives for for a

1807
01:20:30,198 --> 01:20:35,879
couple people to get together but but um

1808
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,760
there seems to be issues with the rules

1809
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,639
between letting a couple people get

1810
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,079
together to grow together versus how

1811
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:43,079
many plants on a parcel and and we're

1812
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:44,719
not going to we're not going to

1813
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:46,238
deconstruct the law here tonight but

1814
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:49,359
we're still hoping that the legislature

1815
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:52,319
cleans up some of the rules um during

1816
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:54,519
this session uh so that it becomes less

1817
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:56,840
of a mess it's so muddy right now nobody

1818
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:59,320
knows anything right yes it is

1819
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:01,600
incredibly muddy right now which is

1820
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:05,519
which is why you know we're I'm teaching

1821
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:07,920
this information right and and it may be

1822
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,000
legal to grow not being a patient and it

1823
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,719
may not be legal to grow to a patient

1824
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,158
this summer but if you're a grower you

1825
01:21:11,719 --> 01:21:17,239
have to make these decisions here in the

1826
01:21:13,158 --> 01:21:19,719
next few weeks so um but you know the

1827
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:21,559
the legislature is not really concerned

1828
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:23,920
with our preferences and we've seen that

1829
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,480
they really don't care our patients so

1830
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:29,119
we got to take care of ourselves

1831
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:31,559
wow like in in the past I've had

1832
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:33,359
helicopters flying over taking pictures

1833
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:37,880
and all this kind of thing do you get a

1834
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:41,119
sense of what their uh aim is coming up

1835
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:43,239
or well secretive about that yeah the

1836
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:45,639
short answer is that we don't know what

1837
01:21:43,238 --> 01:21:48,559
their plans are the longer answer though

1838
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:50,760
is that at the um the the Cannabis

1839
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,039
ethics meeting I was at 2 months ago I

1840
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:57,039
was spok speaking to uh senator Cole

1841
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:59,198
Wells and um and I asked her about

1842
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:01,319
bachel I said you know we have a Trade

1843
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:05,359
Organization we had

1844
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:06,759
152 medical Growers which are now all

1845
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:10,119
having to make the choice for their

1846
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:12,639
families to either give up this extra

1847
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:15,238
income or become criminals in the eyes

1848
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:18,960
of the state what are these people that

1849
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:21,000
the state encouraged to get involved and

1850
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,239
all the rural Economic Development we

1851
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,800
did what are they supposed to do are you

1852
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:28,479
going to send the King County Sheriff

1853
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:30,800
out here to start busting families and I

1854
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,799
didn't get an answer and what I mostly

1855
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,840
got was shock looks because people

1856
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,520
hadn't really considered all the people

1857
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:40,600
who on who had intentionally built

1858
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:42,760
businesses across Washington that now

1859
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:46,079
have got to make this terrible choice

1860
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:49,119
you know we've got 502 members in in the

1861
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:51,238
organization and I support them and and

1862
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:53,519
their right to try to make uh you know

1863
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:57,559
some profit from Canada is just like the

1864
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:59,719
medical folks were as well right but the

1865
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,320
the the medical Growers families have

1866
01:22:59,719 --> 01:23:03,840
got a decision to make right now that's

1867
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:08,158
really challenging um we are all

1868
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:10,480
watching to see what happens uh you know

1869
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:12,599
the the DEA is not spending any more

1870
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:15,919
money on cidis interdiction so they're

1871
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:19,840
out of the game um our local King County

1872
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:22,119
Sheriff seems to be um you know there's

1873
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,400
no problem if there's no problem right

1874
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:24,880
if you're growing a couple plants at

1875
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:26,399
your house and there's no problem

1876
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,679
nobody's going to give you a hard time

1877
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:31,000
but if you're growing a couple plants at

1878
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:33,800
your house and you're beating your wife

1879
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,840
and you have weapons and they come to

1880
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:40,279
your house and you're a jerk they may

1881
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:42,520
use the Cannabis to take you in because

1882
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:45,519
they need they need to put together a

1883
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:47,440
case against you right so so the best

1884
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:52,040
advice I'm getting

1885
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:54,678
is be be polite be private don't grow

1886
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:57,079
too many plants don't be to too

1887
01:23:54,679 --> 01:23:59,880
flamboyant don't sell it and keep it

1888
01:23:57,079 --> 01:24:02,198
away from kids right if you do those

1889
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:05,119
things regardless of what the letter of

1890
01:24:02,198 --> 01:24:07,079
the law is probably no one is going to

1891
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:09,639
have enforcement I certainly don't

1892
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:11,039
expect the huge helicopters to be back

1893
01:24:09,639 --> 01:24:12,639
like they were in the '90s scaring the

1894
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:15,600
hell out of everybody on the

1895
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:17,679
island but we'll see what happens right

1896
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,360
uh things could change in a really bad

1897
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:23,600
direction if uh depending on who's in

1898
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:25,679
the Oval Office too right so

1899
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:29,679
all right so with that we want to get on

1900
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,679
to the door prizes so thank you very

1901
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,880
much
