1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,979
so John thank you so much for taking

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,150
some time out of your busy schedule this

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,000
morning that chat with me

4
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:29,148
I had a great tour yesterday here at 7

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,969
acres and meeting your staff who were

6
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:34,280
like all surprisingly joyful and super

7
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:37,338
knowledgeable so it was it was both fun

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,890
to see what real seriously scaled

9
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:43,219
cannabis was is look you know turning

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,620
out to be but also to see you know a

11
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,768
staff that's really joyful in producing

12
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:52,038
the cannabis plant in a very structured

13
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:53,358
and analytical environment right so what

14
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,899
I wanted to talk to you about though

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,250
today you know as as you know part of

16
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,850
the you know the company's visionary

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,530
team right you helped influence the

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,179
direction of the company and one of the

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,649
reasons why I wanted to come here and

20
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:08,600
meet you in person

21
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,579
it's because I've watched some of your

22
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:14,269
videos of your public speaking gigs and

23
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:17,750
you are a hardcore whole plant guy like

24
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:19,459
I am right and and and to hear the words

25
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,890
coming out of your mouth about the

26
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:24,978
importance of sticking with whole plant

27
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,829
not only warms my heart but I gotta say

28
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:31,728
it's becoming increasingly rare in

29
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:35,149
scaled cannabis companies because as as

30
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:38,030
people scale up manufacturing and whole

31
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:40,640
plant are kind of two ends of a scale

32
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,180
and so you get people starting to cut

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,590
corners and use isolates or take apart

34
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:51,950
the plant and then put it back together

35
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:54,170
in the extraction and that you know it's

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,390
not what the plants about for me so I

37
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,140
wanted to ask you to kind of share with

38
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:03,890
all of us what your vision is for how do

39
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:08,538
you scale a company large enough that

40
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,939
you are able to provide flower for you

41
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:14,268
know soon an entire country and yet

42
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,680
still hold to your whole plant ideals so

43
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:18,530
it's been a challenge absolutely

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
for me it started by giving the team

45
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,909
here so there's six hundred and fifty

46
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,789
people behind us a very

47
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:27,250
vision to really grow great it's gonna

48
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:30,250
grow great catalyst to really give the

49
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,810
plant the same attention and love we

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,210
would give it if we're growing four

51
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,490
plants at home or a couple of lights you

52
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,409
know in the old world and when we gave

53
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,719
that vision and then started hiring

54
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,729
really smart people they never wavered

55
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,300
from that North Star of to put it very

56
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:48,879
plainly great cannabis and how that

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,860
aligns with what we're doing is we think

58
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,259
whole plant or I think whole plant is

59
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,820
you know historically a better medicine

60
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:57,009
you know I'm not a doctor but you know

61
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:58,299
I've seen enough anecdotally over 15

62
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,829
years to see the effect than the on

63
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,840
throwing effect in order to walk from

64
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,150
your podcast as well

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,159
you know I think that's also there's

66
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,789
more safety involved so I like to say we

67
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,639
have a 10,000 year informal safety study

68
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:15,099
on on flower and called simple extract

69
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,319
use where we've shown it's relatively

70
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:19,269
safe for people and you know some of

71
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,469
your guesses at exceptionally safe for

72
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,620
people but from a business perspective

73
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:26,259
when I put that out on when you do hard

74
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,030
things well that's where you build a

75
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:29,769
defense around your business so it might

76
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,689
take you longer to get going it might

77
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,980
cost you a bit more investment but what

78
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:35,199
you have at the end is more valuable

79
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:37,810
business so our view is if we can make

80
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,789
great flower we can have a great

81
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,770
business selling flower to Canadians

82
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:42,280
which we think you know flower and

83
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,750
pre-rolls

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,419
you know it's going to be a half or so

85
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,909
of the market but more importantly that

86
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:50,500
becomes the key ingredient when we get

87
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,359
into derivative products and we start to

88
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,270
look at making whole plant oils or

89
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,010
tinctures whole plant dates and

90
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,260
eventually using whole plant products

91
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,519
for you know other topicals and things

92
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:02,439
like that that's what's going to

93
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,120
differentiate us and because you put the

94
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,400
work in here to create the ingredients

95
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,849
that's what gives us an advantage of the

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,129
business right on so I I've seen some of

97
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,019
your videos from idea City where you wax

98
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,370
poetic about the importance of whole

99
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,750
plant right it's beautiful right it's

100
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,720
like it's like good song and I'm like oh

101
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,759
speaking made-up and I want to get a

102
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,500
little bit of that now cuz I bet you you

103
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,300
know you involved you were involved with

104
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,379
a whole bunch of like seriously deep

105
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,020
pocket investment class

106
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:32,620
people and those are generally the folks

107
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:36,979
who are pushing people in your position

108
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,810
to cheapen up right and move away from

109
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,670
whole plant because it's cheaper or

110
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,939
easier or more efficient or whatever

111
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,189
right and and you have to constantly

112
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,709
push back to that and a lot of these

113
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:50,329
folks these investment folks they do not

114
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:52,759
they don't have a cannabis background

115
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:55,370
right so whole plan or not it's widgets

116
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,129
to a lot some of these folks right so so

117
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,670
how do you explain to these folks

118
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:04,279
why whole plant is important to be

119
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,350
preserved at scale and it makes smart

120
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,599
money absolutely so you know this

121
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,800
company we've raised almost a quarter

122
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,580
billion dollars of capital for the

123
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,220
business so I have to always make sure I

124
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,259
remind myself you know investors are not

125
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,390
here to fund my hopes and dreams now

126
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,920
they're here to make a good business but

127
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,959
if I can align those two that's where I

128
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,850
get the most satisfaction and when I've

129
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,430
been really proud of our team being able

130
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,439
to do that for the past five years what

131
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,959
it came down to with education about why

132
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,670
this might be harder it might take us

133
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,949
longer but it's going to give us a

134
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:39,160
better more defensible business over

135
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:42,050
time and let me give you an example

136
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,750
let's say two companies want to put the

137
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,509
market you know a cannabinoid edible

138
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,579
let's say for a CBD dominant wellness

139
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:52,339
edible whether it's a gummy or the

140
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:55,550
format doesn't matter for now if we go

141
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:57,699
and we breed a very specific plant for

142
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,170
it grow it in a very specific way

143
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:02,089
process extract and manufacture in a

144
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,639
specific way so we have a whole plant

145
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:05,679
product and I love

146
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,569
ethan were so set on your podcast about

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,629
go back to the genetics and breed what

148
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,129
you want don't remix it in the lab now

149
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,900
we have a product that maybe not every

150
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,310
consumer is going to care about but the

151
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,168
consumers are really care about that we

152
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,060
think will be more brand loyal and

153
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,519
potentially pay more over time you know

154
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,050
better for our business compare that

155
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,938
against if we just wanted to put ten

156
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,650
milligrams of generic CD nice ligament

157
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,210
we might have a good business this year

158
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:31,658
we might have a good business next year

159
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:33,339
but what happens when Jameson's vitamins

160
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:35,050
so the biggest vitamin company in Canada

161
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,060
I believe wants to make that same

162
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,460
product they can call it the same vendor

163
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,769
let's get the same CBD isolate and they

164
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:43,930
are way better than we are about putting

165
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,818
vitamin powders into products they've

166
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,889
been doing for a long time so all of a

167
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,270
sudden we lose that competitive

168
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:52,689
advantage we've built in the plants

169
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:54,639
we've lose lost that differentiation to

170
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:55,870
speak to consumers and actually we're

171
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,090
behind because they have better

172
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,129
relationships with national drugstores

173
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:01,718
and national retailers and at the end of

174
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:03,550
the day we will lose as a business and

175
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:06,339
that's what we've educated our

176
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,560
shareholders and investors about that's

177
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:10,838
what we educate our management team on

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,120
how are we gonna win over the long run

179
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:15,158
and I think that's what plant and for me

180
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,348
personally what could be better than

181
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:19,689
that aligns exactly with you know my

182
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:21,968
personal vision on why cannabis works

183
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,348
and how it works and and let's you know

184
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:25,060
be serious it's not a coincidence that

185
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:26,889
those two came together but there's a

186
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,360
lot of work to get everybody on the bus

187
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,978
driving in the same direction yeah right

188
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,889
on and it's interesting too because to

189
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:34,688
hear you talk about you know you you

190
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,629
know your product and the customers and

191
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:40,210
the whole plant you know in my head you

192
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:42,009
know I'm always thinking about whole

193
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,750
plant for patients right is a bit I'm a

194
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,278
very you know the shows very patient

195
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,038
centric my backgrounds very patient

196
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:50,288
centric and and yet you know while

197
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:52,688
there's a lot of isolate type products

198
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:56,769
in the market that that more rep type

199
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:59,468
users are using if you give them a whole

200
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:01,359
plant product you get all these like

201
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:03,370
positive responses because it's a better

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,088
experience for everybody right anybody

203
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,199
who has access to whole plant products

204
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:11,829
ends up loving them right

205
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,509
so but I know your background because

206
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:15,848
you and I have had some time in the car

207
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:17,979
together and you know I know you're back

208
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:20,009
on this patient oriented right you know

209
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:22,449
you were you were working in Canada

210
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,180
reaching out for patients helping to

211
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:29,560
provide helping to get the the early

212
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,658
compassionate care retailers you know in

213
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,240
business and staying in business so

214
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:37,269
you're not like one of these these these

215
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,418
other entrepreneurs who you know solder

216
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:42,009
dry-cleaning you know company and and

217
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:43,360
are coming over from the Green Rush

218
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,939
right and then you've been around for a

219
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,320
long time so to what degree do you think

220
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,329
that it informs your decisions here at

221
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,990
well you know technically you're at

222
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:58,539
supreme but today we're at seven acres

223
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,909
you're Rowland's at supreme helping

224
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,769
guide these businesses to what degree do

225
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:04,990
you think that's informed because of the

226
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,789
time you put in dealing with real sick

227
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,740
people every day I think one of my

228
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:11,049
biggest advances as an entrepreneur in

229
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,579
cannabis I don't think this plant was

230
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:15,309
invented a couple of years ago and I

231
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:19,809
think a lot of people think it's new you

232
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:21,278
know the for your American viewers this

233
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,009
is gonna be very hot in Canada it was a

234
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,500
unique concept as a business to say

235
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:28,028
people who smoke cannabis whether it's

236
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,589
medical or recreational or wellness

237
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:31,509
whatever your purpose is if you smoke

238
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,970
cannabis you want good cannabis you want

239
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:35,500
to look good smell good tastes good 90%

240
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,570
of people watching I assume you're gonna

241
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,990
think duh you know everybody knows that

242
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,760
in the Canadian space that was a

243
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,919
revolutionary idea which is less of a

244
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,419
couple of dots and more of a concerning

245
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,448
question for for the rest of the

246
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,879
industry but that's we approached it and

247
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:53,109
what we we started with flour that was

248
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,879
all you could do in the Canadian

249
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,039
industry and we said look and we're

250
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,019
gonna sell flour whether we might pick

251
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,509
different genetics to cultivate

252
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:03,730
depending if it's a medical product at

253
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:05,470
the end of the day or our recreational

254
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,839
consumer at the end of the day but what

255
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,579
we found was there drivers for people

256
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,340
that are smoking their cannabis for

257
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:12,049
whatever reason

258
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,970
are the same right they wanted to smell

259
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:15,709
nice they want it to taste nice they

260
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,910
don't want a black ash and then they

261
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,639
want whatever that effect they're

262
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:22,219
seeking is so to build a platform that

263
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,830
can grow good cannabis that smells good

264
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,350
tastes good burns nice that think of

265
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,540
that as an agnostic platform we can put

266
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,310
you know high CBD strains on like some

267
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:33,740
of them we grow now that's maybe more

268
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:35,539
wellness suited or medical student well

269
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,089
we're starting to just scratch the

270
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:40,129
surface on minor cannabinoids or we can

271
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:42,410
grow high THC for whatever that purpose

272
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:44,360
is but the platform is the same grow

273
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:46,338
good cannabis and when we get into our

274
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,560
derivative products it's that good

275
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,960
cannabis you know whole plant cannabis

276
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,479
that we treat very gently in our

277
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,528
extractions and formulations that we

278
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,710
believe is going to help make us

279
00:10:54,528 --> 00:11:00,379
different over time right on so um it's

280
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:04,040
funny because when I talk to cannabis

281
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:06,200
entrepreneurs many of them like the

282
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,610
monopoly mindset like they don't want

283
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,589
anybody else in the market I mean like

284
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,139
look at Florida right like and we're

285
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:14,029
we're you know they would just be happy

286
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:17,149
to be the only one providing cannabis to

287
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:20,059
everybody but you know you're very

288
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:22,009
encouraging of other entrepreneurs and

289
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:24,889
and and helping people come up and

290
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:27,409
giving people good advice and so so

291
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:31,129
let's finish up with this there are

292
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:32,838
people not only in Canada in the United

293
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:34,909
States but really all around the world

294
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,160
who are putting together cannabis

295
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:39,919
companies and they have got to decide

296
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:43,819
what their vision is for their company

297
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,899
and and what kind of quality products

298
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,390
they're gonna put out and where they're

299
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:49,069
gonna draw their lines right you know

300
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:52,789
clearly you and I both talked about

301
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:55,820
whole plant a lot but it's very hard for

302
00:11:52,789 --> 00:12:00,588
some new people to the business of

303
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:03,740
cannabis to step into the power that

304
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:06,380
comes with producing whole plant

305
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,959
cannabis products what advice would you

306
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:11,990
offer to entrepreneurs who are at the

307
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:14,629
formulating stages of their business to

308
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,919
encourage them to go whole plant for

309
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,110
ever

310
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,469
is benefit so today first if you're

311
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,820
starting a cannabis business generally

312
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,490
forget the cannabis word and just focus

313
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,170
on the business part meaning you start

314
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,879
with your customer you know who do you

315
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:29,860
want to sell to what are you gonna sell

316
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,059
them what are you gonna do to delight

317
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,310
them or make them feel better or

318
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:35,289
whatever your business purpose is and

319
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:37,208
then start working back you know what

320
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:38,980
can I sell that product for what's it

321
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,778
gonna cost me to produce what kind of

322
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,360
infrastructure facilities do I need or

323
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:45,879
licenses and staff and really understand

324
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,050
is that a viable business first you know

325
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,509
something is very important to

326
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:51,759
understand cannabis is not a magical

327
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:53,439
product in a business sense you know

328
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,000
it's got margins like anything else it's

329
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,949
got cost it's got competition

330
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,110
so start first does your business make

331
00:12:56,948 --> 00:13:02,679
sense what I would encourage people to

332
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,449
think about is his whole plant a way

333
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,338
that you can differentiate your business

334
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:08,528
and make it more successful over time

335
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,199
make yourself less subject to the

336
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:13,419
competition of large non cannabis

337
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,859
companies who at some point soon are

338
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,229
going to start buying isolates and

339
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,970
dropping them into products to make

340
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,850
yourself if you're not a big fan of

341
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,870
large corporate cannabis and maybe you

342
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,360
think they're not doing a great job

343
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:28,028
producing high quality products or are

344
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,100
flour or whole plant products find that

345
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:31,750
niche or that white space that you want

346
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,759
to drive a Mack truck through to make

347
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,490
your business successful and my belief

348
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,278
is when we survey the market in Canada

349
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,019
or we look at a lot of the US what we

350
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,759
find is if you look at smaller companies

351
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:45,310
there's a lot of people doing really

352
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,439
great things with the plant mostly

353
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:49,509
staying whole plant and they have a

354
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,880
really core committed consumer group

355
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:53,078
that's very happy to work with them when

356
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,240
you go to some of the more scaled

357
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,859
companies it's more just most supply

358
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,589
chain and distribution and being there

359
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,209
and sometimes the products aren't as

360
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,430
good as maybe they should be

361
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:07,419
and I think we should look at that as a

362
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:08,558
big opportunity to take market share to

363
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,419
take consumers over time to be

364
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:11,860
successful and I mean that whether

365
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:13,778
you're a lifestyle business where your

366
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,009
goal is to have you know your family and

367
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:17,169
friends employed and everyone makes a

368
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:19,749
decent paycheck or your company you know

369
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:21,399
like ours I mean don't get me wrong we'd

370
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:22,808
love to earn the monopoly overtime and

371
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,639
compete people out of the market and be

372
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:26,110
the last guy standing we don't want to

373
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,329
do that because the law made it that way

374
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,339
that's not fun for me we don't want to

375
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:31,719
do that because you know the police went

376
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:33,639
knocked on the door the people that came

377
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,470
before us I also don't agree that we

378
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,870
want to produce better products that

379
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,120
make consumers love us more and we went

380
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,528
over the long run but I think whether

381
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,749
you're big or small you got to go back

382
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:46,299
to that fundamental concept what's gonna

383
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:48,639
make you different consumers only have a

384
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:50,019
limited amount of funds to spend even if

385
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,058
they have insurance of limited amount of

386
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,709
insurance coverage to spend why are they

387
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,350
gonna choose to spend that with you and

388
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:58,149
I think that that mindset is no

389
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,709
different than if I'm going to start

390
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:01,720
selling widgets or cell phones or

391
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:03,308
anything else it's figure out that

392
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,959
product that makes you special and

393
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:06,938
unique and tell that story to your

394
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,828
customers and for us and I think for a

395
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:10,659
lot of people if you look on the whole

396
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:11,888
plant sign you're gonna find very

397
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,438
fertile territory

398
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,539
to build a brand differentiated products

399
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:18,370
and make a successful business you are

400
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:21,338
gonna work hard yeah you are gonna work

401
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:23,399
harder yeah so man thank you so much for

402
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,899
sticking to your guns about old plan

403
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,970
there's a lot of whole plant people that

404
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:30,669
kind of like the lower echelon where

405
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,910
where I am but but guys like you who are

406
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:35,649
dealing with 9 figure businesses you

407
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:37,419
know whole plant is beaten out of most

408
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,578
everybody and the fact that that you're

409
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:42,399
sticking to it and creating a model and

410
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:45,008
and and making money so that people see

411
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,558
that it's possible you know I think that

412
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,639
it just it encourages everybody that we

413
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:52,769
might be able to have a whole prime

414
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,769
future so thanks Allah to Shane

415
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,049
you
