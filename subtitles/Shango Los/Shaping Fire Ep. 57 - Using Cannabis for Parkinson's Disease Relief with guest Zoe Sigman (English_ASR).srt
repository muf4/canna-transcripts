2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,138
without a doubt the most important group

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,210
of folks in the cannabis scene are the

4
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:13,709
cannabis patients of course I am happy

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,260
for everyone to have better access to

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,359
cannabis but for me helping defend

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,010
patient access to clean and legal

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,260
cannabis and making sure they are

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,300
educated in how to use it is my driving

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,640
force even though I'm not a doctor

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,560
because I interview so many doctors and

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,810
I bother to read the scientific papers

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,030
that come out about cannabis medicine

14
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,460
lots of folks approached me at cannabis

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,109
conventions at the grocery or even on

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,420
the ferry back home to Vashon on Island

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,878
to ask for suggestions and relieving

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,520
their symptoms of this or that in most

19
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,649
cases I have read something or done an

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,020
interview on a particular topic and have

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,609
something helpful to say some topics I'm

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,070
particularly deep on and I'll teach

23
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,350
those to small groups one of the most

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,390
asked about topics is Parkinson's

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,160
disease Parkinson's has become

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,808
incredibly common and there are a lot of

27
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,209
good people getting bad information

28
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,429

Parkinson's is the second set explains

practices for using cannabis in

real-life applications our goal is to

97
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:30,489
provide actionable information for

98
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:34,629
Parkinson's patients and those who love

99
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,340

how are you doing great thank you so

101
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,000
much for giving us some of your valuable

102
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:42,370
time I know you're on the road and I

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,209
appreciate you being with us thank you

104
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,329
so much for having me on

105
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:49,449
so Parkinson's disease and a handful of

106
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,909
similar afflictions are often put in a

107
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:55,060
basket together because they share many

108
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:57,009
of the same causes and symptoms so so

109
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,959
let's start there to make sure that

110
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,000
we're all on the same page about what

111
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,459
we're gonna be talking about today one

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,489
of the most prevalent visible symptoms

113
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:09,219
of advanced Parkinson's disease is the

114
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,439
vit is the tremors usually starting in

115
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:14,169
one hand and then and then unfortunately

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,009
spreading from there what are some of

117
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:21,370
the signs of Parkinson's that people

118
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:23,620
commonly become aware of first yeah I

119
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,870
mean the tremor really is the first sort

120
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,100
of noticeable physical sign of

121
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,079
Parkinson's

122
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,310
unfortunately at that point the disease

123
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:36,000
is pretty far progressed really early

124
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,829
signs that I have come across our

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,800
constipation and a loss of spell so

126
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:43,629
they're very subtle symptoms early on so

127
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,610
it really is sort of when the tremors

128
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:48,550
start that people start to think oh

129
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,500
maybe this is Parkinson's disease that's

130
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,819
interesting I had not heard about the

131
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,259
the loss of sense of smell and and you

132
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,819
know for a lot of people I think that

133
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:59,500
they go you know maybe that's a stuff

134
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:03,159
nose or maybe it's allergies or

135
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,079
something or age you know yeah yeah yeah

136
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,320
and and as we know what by the time the

137
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:12,959
tremors have arrived you're all you've

138
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:16,360
already lost so many dopamine creating

139
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:19,509
brain cells that we're already far down

140
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,730
the path so yes that point you've lost

141
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:25,480
60 percent of the dope name

142
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,640
dopamine-producing neurons so it's it's

143
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,160
a lot yeah it is a lot and and usually

144
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,110
by the time people get to cannabis they

145
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,450
are they have already you know

146
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,040
Parkinson's is already part of their

147
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,209
life they've already been going to

148
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,750
doctors for it

149
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:43,689
they've been they've got a diagnosis and

150
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:47,170
they are they are weighing treatment at

151
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:49,209
this point and but I know I don't want

152
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,350
to give symptoms short shrift because

153
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:52,839
we're gonna be talking about the

154
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,700
symptoms a lot more later on when we're

155
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,709
going to be talking about how cannabis

156
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:59,170
can help relieve some of those symptoms

157
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:01,209
so so why don't we do a little more of a

158
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,740
review of what those symptoms are likely

159
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,079
and let's let's talk about them in two

160
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:09,850
categories would you first talk about

161
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:14,199
the the early maybe less recognizable

162
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:16,830
symptoms like a sense of smell and then

163
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,990
and then and then talk a bit more about

164
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:22,060
the the ones that were more familiar

165
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,389
with like the shuffling of the feet and

166
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:29,290
and and and bending over a little bit

167
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:31,089
and as for people who maybe are not the

168
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,439
Parkinson's patient themselves who are

169
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,978
listening but maybe have a loved one

170
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,959
let's let's let's dig into that a bit so

171
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:40,180
some of the early symptoms and these are

172
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,229
also secondary symptoms later in the

173
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,959
disease program

174
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,750
our digestive issues so not just

175
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:50,769
constipation but oftentimes like nausea

176
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,980
or loss of appetite mood disorders are

177
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:58,870
also common anxiety and depression this

178
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:01,720
is both it could be an early symptom

179
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:04,030
it's also we're adults

180
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,890
and people who are getting older often

181
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,539
have a little bit more anxiety about

182
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,399
getting older and so again it's not like

183
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,430
a concrete way to determine whether or

184
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:14,789
not you have Parkinson's pain sleeping

185
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,530
issues these are all things that can be

186
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,660
indicative of Parkinson's disease early

187
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:23,739
on but they're also just common ailments

188
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,570
as we age with other conditions so it's

189
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,889
difficult to say if they're directly

190
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:28,449
connected to Parkinson's but they are

191
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,779
common in people with Parkinson's

192
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:34,029
disease as the disease progresses into

193
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:36,189
the motor symptoms you of course get the

194
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,829
tremors there is something called

195
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:43,350
Braddock hadisha which is a slowed

196
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:45,449
movement so it's this inability to

197
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:49,470
consciously move quickly

198
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:52,509
there's rigid muscles impaired posture

199
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,430
loss of the ability to control your

200
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,379
movements completely and so it's like

201
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,259
you have muscle spasticity you have

202
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,519
tremors all of these like different

203
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,680
involuntary movements are in slightly

204
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,569
different categories but they are they

205
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,689
can look pretty similar to people who

206
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,519
are not experiencing them and that's one

207
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:11,379
of the challenges right because I want

208
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,389
one of the things that everyone

209
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:16,899
recommends for Parkinson's is to start

210
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:19,000
treating early but so many of the early

211
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:21,219
symptoms could be so many different

212
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,110
things you know swallowing problems and

213
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:28,420
chewing and eating problems and sleeping

214
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:30,250
problems and you know constipation so

215
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,930
many different things can be causing

216
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,159
these including like other medications

217
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,379
that you may be on because all this

218
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,529
stuff is side effects from other

219
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:42,309
pharmaceuticals and more often than not

220
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:46,539
the patients that I have worked with it

221
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:49,539
is when the tremors start to arrive and

222
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:52,349
and you really have the difficulty with

223
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:55,000
motor function tremors the slight

224
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,250
hunching over the shuffling of the feet

225
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,070
you can't get in a good step it's it's

226
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:03,370
somewhere in there that either they or

227
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:06,430
their spouse or a good friend points out

228
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:09,429
hey do you know that you're like you're

229
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:11,259
doing this and that's when people start

230
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:14,199
going oh man maybe this maybe this isn't

231
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:16,840
just something from the pharmaceuticals

232
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,240
maybe this as a package is is something

233
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,740
more serious right right and that's a

234
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,509
really hard realization for a lot of

235
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,789
people and you know it's sort of at that

236
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:27,909
point you could go in and the doctor can

237
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:30,039
test for some like biomarkers of the

238
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:30,579
disease but if you're already if you're

239
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,089
already there

240
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,600
it's sort of like okay here we go yeah

241
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:41,080
so all right so so let's talk about more

242
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,450
the the underlying what Parkinson's is B

243
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,570
and I know that it gets gray real fast

244
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:52,090
because yeah real fast because you know

245
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:55,780
we don't we don't really know however it

246
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:58,629
is common to be around you know with

247
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,639
Parkinson's groups and have people say

248
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:04,299
that it's it's difficult for them to

249
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:08,230
figure out sometimes which of their

250
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:11,529
symptoms are causing the Parkinson's and

251
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:16,539
which of their symptoms are coming from

252
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:19,689
the Parkinson's and and I often offer a

253
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:22,870
delineation to patients that it is not

254
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,630
really as effective to try to determine

255
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:28,509
which is causing which it's it's almost

256
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:30,549
like these things are a package that

257
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:35,379
start to show up at the same time and

258
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:39,370
and and the same attributes that that we

259
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:42,838
use to diagnose Parkinson's also cause

260
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,129
these other symptoms and it's very often

261
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,750
difficult to figure out you know which

262
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:48,460
came first the chicken or the egg right

263
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,159
which came first the symptoms or the

264
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,389
Parkinson's so right so will you kind of

265
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,909
get to the heart of the matter and let

266
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:57,309
us have a better understanding of what

267
00:10:54,909 --> 00:11:00,730
the state of the science is about what

268
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:02,769
Parkinson's is and its cause to the best

269
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,700
that we know and so that we can start

270
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:08,710
teasing out symptoms from cause totally

271
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,360
so I mean you are

272
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:14,769
to say that it gets gray really quickly

273
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,629
so there's a couple of underlying causes

274
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:19,750
for Parkinson's disease Parkinson's

275
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:22,149
disease neurologically so it's

276
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,309
characterized by the loss of neurons

277
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,590
that produce dopamine in a particular

278
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:29,109
part of the brain and therefore a loss

279
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:32,500
of dopamine in other parts of the brain

280
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,779
later on it's also marked by an

281
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,720
accumulation of these protein clusters

282
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:40,509
called Lewy bodies now that really is

283
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,340
sort of like a dead end there's not a

284
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:44,350
lot about Lewy bodies out there it's

285
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,420
just sort of like here's a biomarker of

286
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,100
Parkinson's disease if you see an

287
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:51,519
accumulation of this kind of protein

288
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,560
this is associated with this disease for

289
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,799
the most part people and researchers are

290
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,419
focused on the dopamine aspect of the

291
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,909
disease the loss of dopamine how to

292
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:02,469
prevent the loss of the neurons that

293
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:05,049
produce dopamine how to preserve

294
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:09,509
dopamine that's hanging out in your

295
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:15,159
brain and other than that the

296
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:17,860
pathophysiology is very grey we don't

297
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,750
really know what factors play into the

298
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,310
development of Parkinson's disease it

299
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,330
could be genetic it could be

300
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:29,739
environmental we know that there are a

301
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:32,170
couple of symptoms neurologically that

302
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,940
are associated with Parkinson's but only

303
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:36,240
Parkinson's what you were talking about

304
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,110
earlier where Parkinson's disease is

305
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,860
included in a lot of other

306
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:45,159
neurodegenerative diseases those

307
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,210
diseases are often associated with neuro

308
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:51,519
inflammation oxidative stress

309
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,889
excitotoxin a calcium channel

310
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,100
dysregulation a bunch of things in the

311
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,529
brain that show that something is not

312
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,330
functioning properly and so Parkinson's

313
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,429
exhibits all of those things as well

314
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,610
and so that actually brings us back to

315
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:09,609
this idea that that Parkinson's and it's

316
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,769
kind of related ailments you know you

317
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,409
know parkinsonian syndrome and you know

318
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:16,809
the things that are all kind of often

319
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:19,990
put in this basket they're very often

320
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:21,039
diagnosed by symptoms instead of what's

321
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,720
going on in

322
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,370
the body which which is always strange

323
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,350
right when you like other diseases like

324
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,448
like lupus is another one of those right

325
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,040
there like yeah we don't know what it is

326
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,479
but if you've got this basket of

327
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,759
symptoms we're gonna we're gonna call it

328
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,278
lupus so that we can talk about it right

329
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,470
and but but to distill what you just

330
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:42,068
said down to what I think is the

331
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:46,329
essential kernel the essential kernel

332
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:48,458
seems to be that that for the for the

333
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:53,289
for our conversation today Parkinson's

334
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:56,528
is the the loss of neurons that caught

335
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:59,528
that that create dopamine and it is the

336
00:13:56,528 --> 00:14:03,009
lack of the dopamine in the dopamine

337
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:06,068
serotonin cycle that starts to cause the

338
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:08,889
the more serious aspects that we are

339
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:11,588
more familiar with with with you know

340
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,430
motor and mobile what skills all right

341
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:16,269
exactly

342
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:18,750
so oddly enough when we in during next

343
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:23,370
set and when we start talking more about

344
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,370
how cannabis acts on Parkinson's

345
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:30,729
explaining to patients that that in

346
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:32,949
essence the this bigger picture that is

347
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:38,019
threatening their life it comes down to

348
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:40,958
these these dopamine creating neurons in

349
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:45,399
my experience patients feel a certain

350
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:47,979
amount of I don't know they're glad for

351
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,019
the clarity of purpose right because

352
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,940
Parkinson's is kind of is this big

353
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,980
amorphous thing that that there are many

354
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,800
opinions on but when you bring it down

355
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,909
to this one thing that that you're

356
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:03,879
losing these neurons and that's what is

357
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:05,500
inhibiting your life patients tend to

358
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,230
give me the you know they get this look

359
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,379
of ah this like an aha moment and

360
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,659
they're like oh now I can now I can kind

361
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:16,360
of focus on understanding this because

362
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,769
I've named my monster and I know what it

363
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,688
is

364
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,399
right yeah and in those terms that can

365
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:23,230
be much easier for someone to approach

366
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,318
it to because you know most of us have

367
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,120
heard of dopamine and so if you say hey

368
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:31,349
this is what's going on people have

369
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,389
something to grab onto and then you know

370
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,920
sometimes I have found peep

371
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,889
who have chronic illnesses like

372
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:42,039
Parkinson's disease become huge nerds

373
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,139
about their own condition and so it's

374
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,289
just it's an incredibly useful tool to

375
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:49,629
say like hey here's one of the causes

376
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:54,909
this is what we think is one of the

377
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:57,639
causes of Parkinson's disease so if

378
00:15:54,909 --> 00:16:02,829
we're using Parkinson's disease as the

379
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:04,569
primary let's say the flagship ailment

380
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,150
in this basket

381
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,460
can you elucidate a little bit what the

382
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,230
other ailments in this basket might be

383
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,360
like I've already mentioned parkinsonian

384
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,899
syndrome but honestly that's the only

385
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,879
one I other one I know there often

386
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:22,419
I mean Parkinson's disease research is

387
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,549
often done in conjunction or sort of

388
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:26,979
lumped together with things like

389
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:30,250
Huntington's disease or multiple

390
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,529
sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease so

391
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,629
there they all have different

392
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:36,970
pathophysiology is there all you can

393
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:39,759
definitely tell in the body in the brain

394
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,310
that these are different conditions but

395
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,120
as far as treatment and the underlying

396
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:49,449
causes they're often discussed in the

397
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,549
same sort of way there's specific

398
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,770
research in each of those areas of

399
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:55,479
course but especially when you get into

400
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,419
how cannabis interacts with these

401
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,120
diseases it's they're frequently

402
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:04,680
presented together so I know that you

403
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:09,009
are very hardcore about keeping up on

404
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,980
the up to the date research on a wide

405
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:15,459
range of diseases that you're very

406
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:18,338
focused on is there a lot of research

407
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,930
going on with Parkinson's and cannabis

408
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:22,119
right now I mean clearly there's more

409
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:25,360
science going on now with cannabis and

410
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:28,929
there there has been ever in in human

411
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,789
experience before but still technically

412
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,340
since cannabis is a Schedule one drug

413
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:36,730
and illegal at the federal level it's

414
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:39,159
difficult to get cannabis studies

415
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,740
approved at all and so clearly there's

416
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,769
Parkinson's research going on but how

417
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,230
about Parkinson's in cannabis research

418
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:48,190
yeah actually I'm pretty impressed with

419
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,559
the amount of cane

420
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:57,640
research that focuses on Parkinson's

421
00:17:50,559 --> 00:18:01,750
disease and it largely focuses on CBD

422
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,960
and I think that as CBD has become more

423
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,819
and more legal researchers are really

424
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,470
latching onto it as a compound that

425
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:12,149
could be beneficial for a number of

426
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,710
diseases including Parkinson's that said

427
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,830
the evidence that cannabis could be

428
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,440
useful for Parkinson's has been around

429
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:22,359
for a really long time out like since

430
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,160
the late 19th century before Parkins

431
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,109
dizzy Parkinson's disease was called

432
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,450
Parkinson's disease there was evidence

433
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:32,349
that cannabis at that point canvassed

434
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:35,049
indica could help relieve some of the

435
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:36,699
spasticity and shaking of the condition

436
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:41,079
that is now known as Parkinson's disease

437
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,360
and so there are older pieces of

438
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,829
research that focus on cannabis without

439
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,589
being specific about the cannabinoid

440
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:53,019
content or THC there's also evidence

441
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:57,309
coming out about endocannabinoids minor

442
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:59,410
cannabinoids like THC bcbg all of these

443
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,970
things are areas that researchers are

444
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,740
starting to look at and from the

445
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,839
perspective of Parkinson's I think it is

446
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,569
because Parkinson's is one of the most

447
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,679
common neurodegenerative diseases in our

448
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:12,220
older population

449
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:16,299
and so there's a in addition to that

450
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:18,789
there isn't really a good treatment for

451
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:20,799
it there's there aren't medications at

452
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:23,589
this point that slow the progression of

453
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:27,690
Parkinson's disease there are there's

454
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:30,159
really one or a very small handful of

455
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,559
medications that can treat the symptoms

456
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,150
but the disease will continue to

457
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:40,509
progress and so researchers are really

458
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,430
dead set on trying to find compounds

459
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:43,990
that can slow the progression and I

460
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,370
think that that's why there's been so

461
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,829
much interest in cannabis and

462
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:49,479
cannabinoids yeah absolutely and you

463
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:54,009
know it's interesting that you mentioned

464
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:58,269
that that cannabis has been used for

465
00:19:54,009 --> 00:20:00,250
Parkinson's before it was recognized as

466
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:01,629
Parkinson's you know going back a

467
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,450
hundred years

468
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,880
because you know when you see these old

469
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,180
antique bottles of cannabis you're

470
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,030
reminded that you know historically

471
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:15,519
cannabis has been you know some 70% of

472
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:18,789
the pharmacopoeia of what we humans used

473
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,069
for everything right and and the idea

474
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:24,009
you know that the fact that cannabis

475
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:26,799
being taboo is only really something of

476
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:30,279
the last you know 70 years or so and

477
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,470
though I must admit there is it is crazy

478
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:34,240
to see some of the concoctions that are

479
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,220
in these bottles you know though oh my

480
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,859
god you'll they'll throw you know

481
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,150
cannabis and morphine and cocaine in the

482
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:42,579
same bottle and they'll say this is

483
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,140
medicine and alcohol right you're like

484
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:47,379
oh you know that that will definitely

485
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,150
cure what ails you so but this brings us

486
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,970
up to where we where we are right and

487
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,450
I'm sure most folks are most curious

488
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,759
about how can they actually use cannabis

489
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,250
to treat their Parkinson's and maybe

490
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,379
roll back its progression and we're

491
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,569
gonna start that in a moment for the

492
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,370
second set so let's go ahead and take

493
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:08,289
our first short break and rebuy be right

494
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,329
back you are listening to shaping fire

495
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:11,200
and my guest today is canvas researcher

496
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:15,009
and educator

497
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Zoi Sigmund one of the reasons why

498
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:19,420
no-till cannabis growing is so valued by

499
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,610
farmers is because the mycelium networks

500
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,800
in the soil remain established from year

501
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:25,779
to year and we know these fungal

502
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,879
networks are essential because they are

503
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:29,710
the nutrient super highways that extend

504
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,490
far and wide in the substrate to feed

505
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,220
your plants

506
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,319
the trouble with growing in new soils or

507
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,390
blended cocoa substrates is that it

508
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,299
takes most of the plant's life just to

509
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,759
create these mycelium highways Dino

510
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,369
Michael endo mycorrhizal fungi inoculant

511
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,950
reduces that time and gets your plant

512
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:50,589
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

513
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,330
and it's three times the concentration

514
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:55,779
of the current leading brand in the u.s.

515

at 900 propagules per gram of to fungal

516
00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:00,399

cannabis cultivation this new product

518
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,450
called Dino my co is the result of 30

519
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,039
years of research and trials at the

520

522
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,820
vigorously trialed by cannabis and food

523
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,010
growers across the US since the product

524
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:16,119
first arrived here last year

525
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:18,099

pleased the patients had beautiful

619
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:53,229
female plants and didn't have to call

620
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,419
half of their garden as males the folks

621
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,519
growing for the fun of getting high grew

colorful flowers with exceptional bag

623
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,378
appeal and great highs and breeders had

your host

634
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:26,888
Shango Louis and our guest this week is

635
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:29,769
cannabis researcher and educator is Zoe

636
00:26:26,888 --> 00:26:31,928
Sigmund so cannabis is a long history of

637
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:34,419
being used not only to relieve the

638
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:37,179
symptoms of Parkinson's but also rolling

639
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:39,700
it back because of the cannabis plants

640
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:42,100
ability to cause neurogenesis the

641
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,798
creation of new brain cells at

642
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:48,369
dopamine so before we talk about how

643
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:50,558
cannabis can help in the short term with

644
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:52,298
symptoms abatement how about we start

645
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,379
with your explanation of how cannabis

646
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:58,418
can help combat Parkinson's long-term by

647
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,090
revitalizing the endocannabinoid system

648
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:03,460
and making more of these neurons that

649
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:05,769
are so important totally and there's a

650
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,500
couple of parts of that question so as

651
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:11,288
far as cannabis and neurogenesis this is

652
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:18,308
an area that is of great interest to

653
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:20,890
researchers we start seeing how neuro

654
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:24,099
degeneration is can be caused by things

655
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,900
like neuro inflammation oxidative stress

656
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:28,298
so these are like basically little

657
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,788
compounds that float around wreaking

658
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:34,658
havoc and cannabinoids have been shown

659
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:37,679
to combat those underlying causes of

660
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:39,490
neuro degeneration and so by being

661
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,000
anti-inflammatory by being an

662
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:45,298
antioxidant cannabinoids are able to

663
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,369
help preserve your brain's ability to

664
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:50,500
create new neurons which is incredibly

665
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:53,619
important as we grow and change it's not

666
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,960
like our brains suddenly completely stop

667
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:59,079
creating new neurons it's part of being

668
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,929
alive but in people with Parkinson's

669
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:04,418
disease you see that neurogenesis take a

670
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:08,019
nosedive and so if you can do anything

671
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:09,970
to prevent the underlying causes of a

672
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,500
neuro degeneration you're doing

673
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,870
something good and so there's been all

674
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,798
these individual studies in rodents and

675
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:23,529
in cell cultures that show that THC and

676
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:26,679
CBD and CBD can help retain neuronal

677
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:29,769
health in a number of ways so this is

678
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:32,350
both preserving or protecting from

679
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:34,329
oxidative oxidative factors and also

680
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:37,839
preserving things like synaptic

681
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:39,819
plasticity cells have life cycles it's

682
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,369
really important that they complete the

683
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:44,019
entire life cycle and Parkinson's

684
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:46,689
disease and other neurodegenerative

685
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:47,710
diseases interrupt that life cycle in

686
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,769
one way or another

687
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:53,289
and cannabinoids and the

688
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:55,869
endocannabinoids system are responsible

689
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:58,658
for regulating

690
00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:00,158
life cycles and so manipulating the

691
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:03,039
endocannabinoid system can help

692
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,440
reestablish or preserve some of the

693
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:11,638
ability for cells to have a more normal

694
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:15,340
life cycle the endocannabinoid system is

695
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:17,250
a promising therapeutic target at a

696
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:21,069
number of ways for Parkinson's disease

697
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:24,190
that has to do with its relationship to

698
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:26,769
the dopaminergic system so the system

699
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:29,919
that produces dopamine and this is sort

700
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:33,880
of like a cutting edge of research it's

701
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,130
super interesting it seems like unmanned

702
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,480
amide which is one of the cannabinoids

703
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,980
that our bodies produce an

704
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:45,788
endocannabinoid is vital in the cycle of

705
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:49,110
creating dopamine and it's integral in

706
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:51,759
healthy adults and then in Parkinson's

707
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:53,288
people who have Parkinson's disease we

708
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,179
see a number of impacts on the

709
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:57,339
endocannabinoid system depending on the

710
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:59,919
stage of the disease

711
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:02,678
so in people who are sort of

712
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,720
pre-symptomatic before they have the

713
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,330
motor issues associated with Parkinson's

714
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,100
disease we see a depression of the

715
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:11,379
endocannabinoid system so these are

716
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:16,028
lower levels of endocannabinoids and

717
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,370
endocannabinoid receptors which makes

718
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:20,798
researchers think like huh something is

719
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:23,379
going on potentially like this system

720
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,808
could be a target for therapy and then

721
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,730
as the disease progresses to the

722
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:30,158
intermediate and advanced stages let's

723
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,179
start to see those motor symptoms you

724
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,000
get an overexpression of

725
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:37,419
endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid

726
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,509
receptors and the thought is it could be

727
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:42,788
a compensatory reaction something has

728
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:46,450
happened in the early stages of the

729
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:48,548
disease that causes the endocannabinoid

730
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,830
system to under express which allows

731
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:53,379
things like oxidative factors and

732
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:57,908
inflammatory factors to proliferate in

733
00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:00,940
the brain and that makes the disease

734
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:03,039
progress more quickly and then as it

735
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,740
progresses the endocannabinoid system

736
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:07,388
sort of like snaps back up and starts

737
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,099
over expressing all of these things

738
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:13,389
which is actually kind of good

739
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:17,548
because an and amide has been it's been

740
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:20,080
shown that when you do things chemically

741
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:23,410
that make an and amides stay around

742
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,960
longer you're also making dopamine and

743
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,509
stay around longer and so you kind of

744
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,160
want more an and amide hanging out so

745
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:31,690
you're preserving whatever dopamine your

746
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,150
brain is still producing if you're a

747
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:39,519
Parkinson's patient so it gets a little

748
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:42,190
technical but yeah it's there's there

749
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,558
are many reasons why the endocannabinoid

750
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:50,019
system is a target for therapeutic

751
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:51,879
promis in parkinson's cannabis and the

752
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:55,119
endocannabinoids system are obviously

753
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:59,020
deeply interrelated and what's

754
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:01,349
interesting is in a lot of therapeutic

755
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:04,179
settings and in Parkinson's disease

756
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:05,740
there's evidence basically suggesting

757
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:08,530
like the endocannabinoid system is much

758
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,329
larger than we currently accept it as

759
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,609
being so most people will characterize

760
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:16,569
the endocannabinoid system as consisting

761
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:18,579
of these two receptors cb1 and cb2 the

762
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:21,009
endocannabinoids our bodies produce and

763
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:24,189
the enzymes that synthesize and break

764
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:26,259
down those endocannabinoids but we see

765
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,480
that plant cannabinoids and

766
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:29,950
endocannabinoids interact with a bunch

767
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,839
of different receptors in our body and

768
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,630
these receptors could be very important

769
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:37,089
in helping to mitigate some of the

770
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:41,440
effects of Parkinson's disease and some

771
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:46,329
of them are orphan receptors recently

772
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:49,798
actually very recently CBD was sort of

773
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:52,569
in the parkinsonian research news as

774
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:54,668
being beneficial because it interacted

775
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:58,359
with an orphan receptor receptor called

776
00:32:54,669 --> 00:33:00,788
G pr6 and it was an inverse agonist

777
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,038
which means it makes the receptor do the

778
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:05,408
opposite of what it usually does which

779
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,720
is good because activating the receptor

780
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:13,120
causes an increase in parkinsonian

781
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:15,038
symptoms and CBD by making it do the

782
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,019
opposite caused a decrease in those

783
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:20,109
symptoms and so you start to see like

784
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:21,400
very specifically like all of the

785
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:22,539
effects that different cannabinoids

786
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,200
could have on all these different

787
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,789
receptor

788
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,090
that could be beneficial or not

789
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:29,649
beneficial for Parkinson's disease all

790
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:35,049
right so let's unpack a little bit of

791
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:37,420
this because it is it is complicated but

792
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:41,289
your your your explanation is is on

793
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:44,289
point but I also know that that when I

794
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:48,299
when I publish episodes that are about

795
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:51,549
specific diseases or ailments we attract

796
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:54,069
new listeners who have come just for

797
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:55,720
this one episode right and so first

798
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:57,819
thing I want to do is I want to address

799
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,610
the endocannabinoid system and the way

800
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:02,889
that I usually explain it to non

801
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:06,069
cannabis crowds it's is that the

802
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:08,320
endocannabinoid system is what keeps the

803
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:10,299
human body in homeostasis it keeps

804
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,120
everything in balance it's it's kind of

805
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,190
like the second grade teacher in a

806
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,440
classroom and when the second grade

807
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,570
teacher is in the classroom the kids are

808
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,579
generally well-behaved and doing what

809
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,380
they're supposed to do but as the

810
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:26,739
teacher goes outside of the room into

811
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,360
the hallway eventually one kids gonna

812
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,219
crack up and then another kids gonna

813
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,019
crack up and then and then different

814
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:33,939
kids crack up first and then eventually

815
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:35,889
though you know the the it's it's

816
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,329
chaotic and and that's kind of what

817
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:41,019
happens with the endocannabinoid system

818
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:46,989
as well where the endocannabinoid system

819
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:51,280
once it becomes weakened perhaps this

820
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:53,559
particular body system starts working

821
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,269
less well and then another one Purdue is

822
00:34:53,559 --> 00:35:00,699
is less well and so then we start

823
00:34:55,269 --> 00:35:04,539
getting oxidation or or or inflammation

824
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:07,539
because our body is not doing its its

825
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:10,900
general housecleaning that keeps the

826
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:12,610
body in homeostasis and so since these

827
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,210
cannabinoids that we're talking about

828
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:18,370
which which naturally occur inside the

829
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:22,329
human body as endogenous cannabinoids

830
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:24,549
meaning produced inside the body we turn

831
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:26,440
to cannabis for Fito cannabinoids

832
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,740
because we can get them from a plant and

833
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,630
they do the same thing which is signal

834
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:33,759
right these these cannabinoids are being

835
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,910
used to signal to turn switches on and

836
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,080
off in different parts of the body which

837
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:39,599
is

838
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,489
essentially doing this homeostasis were

839
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,259
so so if we have a dearth of these

840
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:45,750
cannabinoids and our body is not

841
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,180
producing them the switches cannot get

842
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,190
turned on and off and it's as if the

843
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:55,169
second grade teacher is leaving the room

844
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:58,260
and the kids start to act up and it is

845
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:00,200
when these this particular set of kids

846
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,030
if you will that you have just described

847
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:05,689
when when it's these kids that stopped

848
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:09,330
working in the brain the ones that cause

849
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:11,730
Parkinson's symptoms this is why we want

850
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:16,429
to treat Parkinson's with cannabis

851
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:19,380
because we want to give the body the the

852
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:22,980
communication tools to turn these

853
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,869
switches on and off and essentially act

854
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,090
like the second grade teacher in the

855
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:28,949
room how do you buy you like that you'll

856
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,480
buy that yeah all right all right I

857
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:32,669
think I mean like it makes a lot of

858
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,769
sense is it this is how a lot of

859
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,760
researchers look at finding compounds to

860
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:39,030
treat conditions

861
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,190
what's wrong with the cells what can we

862
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,500
do to make the cells do what they

863
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,720
normally do and like this is true of

864
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,210
Parkinson's you know the primary

865
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:52,139
treatment for Parkinson's disease is

866
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:54,389
leave a levodopa which is a precursor to

867
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:57,029
dopamine and so basically researchers

868
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:58,829
were like okay people aren't producing

869
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,250
it up dopamine they get these symptoms

870
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:05,069
that are related to Parkinson's disease

871
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:07,710
this medicine can help brains produce

872
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,780
more dopamine and it's very similar with

873
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,610
cannabinoids you know if the

874
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,620
endocannabinoid system is not

875
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:16,110
functioning property properly not

876
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:19,469
producing endocannabinoids or receptors

877
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:21,120
how do you make it do that will you

878
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,799
introduce a compound that interacts

879
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,069
directly with it and what's interesting

880
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,850
about THC which is the primary plant

881
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,980
compound that interacts v1 and cb2 the

882
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:35,009
sort of best-known receptors in the

883
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:37,710
endocannabinoid system is it it could

884
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:41,100
actually jumpstart the endocannabinoid

885
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:44,130
system if it is underperforming this was

886
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:48,509
a theory put forward by dr. McPartland

887
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:51,059
and guy I don't know five years ago

888
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,100
which is sort of like there might be

889
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:56,039
a clinical endocannabinoid deficiency

890
00:37:53,099 --> 00:38:00,000
that's responsible for a number of

891
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:02,730
conditions and taking THC could sort of

892
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,809
snap everything into place on the other

893
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,740
side of it

894
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:12,059
chronic use of THC down regulates the

895
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:14,309
cb1 receptor and which doesn't really

896
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:17,429
seem to be much of an issue for chronic

897
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:19,230
cannabis users and and this is

898
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:21,419
completely theoretical at this point so

899
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,969
please this is just from me reading

900
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,369
research everyone listening if if

901
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:30,359
Parkinson's disease in its later stages

902
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:34,380
is character an overproduction of cb1

903
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:36,450
receptors perhaps finding a way to down

904
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,320
regulate those receptors could help to

905
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:41,969
restore some balance I don't know that's

906
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,350
an interesting and novel approach I have

907
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:45,899
not heard but they have - that's an

908
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:48,299
interesting idea yeah you know one of

909
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,250
the things that I think it would be

910
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,650
worth teasing out here a little bit is

911
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:55,050
so far you and I've been talking kind of

912
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,139
generally about this basket of

913
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:01,800
cannabinoids that we're going to take

914
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:05,369
from the cannabis plant and and and

915
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,110
somehow these cannabinoids support this

916
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:09,119
endocannabinoid system but I think it's

917
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,039
important to to make sure people

918
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,980
understand that these these various

919
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,509
cannabinoids each have their own job

920
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,539
which is one of the reasons why it's so

921
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:20,130
important to take whole plant

922
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,110
preparations you don't you know you

923
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,930
don't want to just take a cannabinoid

924
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:27,210
isolate like pure CBD crystal or

925
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:30,569
something like that because that that is

926
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:33,300
not treating the whole endocannabinoid

927
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:35,580
system which is what our goal is and and

928
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,260
you'll you'll know these the specifics

929
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,409
on these better than me but to get us

930
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,650
going on at for example THC is an

931
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:48,389
anti-inflammatory CBD increases the

932
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:52,829
number of signaling molecules to to turn

933
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:55,559
on and off these these switches a CBG

934
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:58,019
you know while it decreases the

935
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,349
experience of neuromuscular pain it also

936
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:03,480
offers patients the confidence to feel

937
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:05,670
that they can overcome

938
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,829
the stresses that their body's under so

939
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:12,510
you know each one of these cannabinoids

940
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:15,239
you know taking one on its own doesn't

941
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:17,190
get us where we want to go it's the fact

942
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,679
that all of these different cannabinoids

943
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:22,470
including the ones that we have not even

944
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,389
figured out exist yet these different

945
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:29,250
cannabinoids when they work together in

946
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:32,579
concert they are rehabbing our body's

947
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:36,079
basic synth systems bringing them into

948
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:41,519
homeostasis which by definition will be

949
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:44,730
decreasing the underlying lack of

950
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:47,880
dopamine that would that we call

951
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:49,199
Parkinson's mmhmm yeah totally I mean

952
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,470
it's really important it's really

953
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:56,669
interesting to look at it bringing this

954
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:59,099
back to Parkinson's too because we're

955
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,710
still really figuring out what causes

956
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:05,849
Parkinson's disease we're also still

957
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:08,639
figuring out what we can do to make it

958
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:11,190
better and so sometimes it's like you

959
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,769
have to do three things at once to make

960
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:17,369
the symptoms of Parkinson's disease

961
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:21,090
decrease a good example of that is in a

962
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:23,130
rodent model they had a cb-one

963
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:28,200
antagonist so something that blocked the

964
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:30,809
effects of cb1 and they also had a Fon

965
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:34,108
hitter so they had a compound that

966
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:36,230
basically made an and amide the

967
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:39,539
endocannabinoid that our body produces

968
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:41,250
stay around for longer so they black cb1

969
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:44,429
Maydan and amides to stick around

970
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:46,139
bloggers and saw a decrease in symptoms

971
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:48,029
associated with Parkinson's disease in

972
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:49,679
rodents and it's like you know you're

973
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:53,960
looking at at least three different

974
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:57,679
targets in that model P par gamma C b1

975
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:00,210
and then the fine habitue

976
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,669
it was only when all those things were

977
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:07,050
together that you saw the results you

978
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:09,599
know so it's just combining these things

979
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:11,880
can be very very powerful and it's not

980
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,730
what Western medicine is used to doing

981
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,720
and on top of it each one of those

982
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,409
compounds have many able

983
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:22,118
ocular targets in the body it's not just

984
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:24,429
THC will do this one thing because it

985
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,010
interacts here it's like THC does lots

986
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:31,598
of things because it interacts

987
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:33,910
everywhere so does CBD yeah it's

988
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,830
exciting but it also really pisses off a

989
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:37,889
lot of patients and their families when

990
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:40,480
you're trying to explain right because

991
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:43,089
Western medicine is so reductionist

992
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,820
people want to hear that you know the

993
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:48,369
disease is caused by a and we take B

994
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,580
which undoes a and of story put it in a

995
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:54,039
pill you know yeah and really not only

996
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:56,108
is that not really how nature or our

997
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:58,929
bodies work it is definitely not how

998
00:42:56,108 --> 00:43:02,710
cannabis medicine works and cannabis

999
00:42:58,929 --> 00:43:08,440
medicine is is is more about here is a

1000
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:10,630
broad range of you know naturally

1001
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,789
occurring chemical compounds that our

1002
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,349
body normally makes but it's not making

1003
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:17,500
and so we're gonna get it from a plant

1004
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:21,820
and once we put them in our body you

1005
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:24,219
know dozens of little chemical reactions

1006
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:27,940
happen which when you put them together

1007
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:30,639
becomes a melody that decreases the

1008
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:33,849
experience of disease and potentially

1009
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:36,368
the disease itself and and most people

1010
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:39,220
do not want to hear that kind of an

1011
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:40,660
explanation totally well and I mean

1012
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:42,429
we've all been trained to not accept

1013
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,199
that sort of explanation we're looking

1014
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:45,608
for like you know how often have you

1015
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:47,079
worked with someone who's like oh I'm

1016
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:48,338
having trouble sleeping but I don't want

1017
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:50,710
to feel high and I don't want to feel

1018
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:52,000
altered and like you know what's good

1019
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,760
for sleeping what's good for pain and

1020
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,329
it's kind of like well let's walk you

1021
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:03,030
through like you can't really tease

1022
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:05,348
apart symptom management but based on

1023
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,119
cannabinoids alone like you're not

1024
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:10,390
necessarily going to get the same pain

1025
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:13,420
relieving qualities from CBD as you do

1026
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:15,759
from THC and if you take THC it could be

1027
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:23,700
really good for pain but you might feel

1028
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:23,700
high like it's it's not this completely

1029
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:30,520
custom formed pharmaceutical oh so it's

1030
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,200
a plant it's a plant

1031
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:35,559
a lot of really interesting compounds

1032
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:37,149
and it does a lot of things all at once

1033
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:42,340
and sometimes that's good and sometimes

1034
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:44,230
it's bad like parking in Parkinson's so

1035
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:48,570
much of the research about THC has been

1036
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:52,230
incredibly contradictory because cb1

1037
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:56,440
while it's apparent that it plays a role

1038
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:59,590
activating it has had like very

1039
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,690
contradictory results so activating cb1

1040
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,670
can cause an increase in symptoms or a

1041
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:07,030
decrease in symptoms sort of depending

1042
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:09,430
on the model blocking cb1 same thing

1043
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:13,060
it's obvious that manipulating cb1 has

1044
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:16,149
an impact on this disease but we're not

1045
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:20,170
entirely sure what and it has an impact

1046
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:23,530
on both the disease and the side effects

1047
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:25,750
of the most common medication so tremors

1048
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:30,400
are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease

1049
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:33,460
and they're also a hallmark of the side

1050
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,950
effect of levodopa which is you know

1051
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:39,579
this shaking involuntary muscle movement

1052
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:41,919
that develops in like 30 to 50 percent

1053
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:46,150
of people who take this medication and

1054
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,460
so cb1 activation seems to help the

1055
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:51,789
shaking associated with taking levodopa

1056
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:54,190
but it might not help the shaking

1057
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:56,590
associated with the disease itself so it

1058
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:59,079
gets really complicated it's really hard

1059
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,579
to win it's usually not the patient it's

1060
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:06,340
usually somebody in the patient's family

1061
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:08,440
who will send me an article usually not

1062
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,670
a scientific paper but just some article

1063
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:16,420
that they saw in the internet talking

1064
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:23,139
about how THC in you know lab rat

1065
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:25,659
studies sometimes can increase some of

1066
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:27,339
the markers for Parkinson's and they're

1067
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:28,869
all like my family members should

1068
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,820
absolutely not be taking something that

1069
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:32,799
increases the markers and at the same

1070
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:35,980
time you say you know you got to tell me

1071
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,550
like okay you are my optically looking

1072
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,389
at this one study which we don't really

1073
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:44,510
understand its meaning

1074
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:46,759
yet and it wasn't done in humans but

1075
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,700
perhaps that study is going to be

1076
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,820
outweighed by the fact that that you

1077
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:56,739
know cannabinoids cause neurogenesis and

1078
00:46:52,820 --> 00:47:00,950
the creation of more dopamine creating

1079
00:46:56,739 --> 00:47:03,169
neurons and the the anti-inflammatory

1080
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:05,869
aspects of THC makes the body feel

1081
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:08,960
better and the muscle relaxation aspects

1082
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:10,849
of it decrease the tremors and the CBG

1083
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,590
increases the patient's confidence and

1084
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:14,539
decreases the neuromuscular pain so

1085
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:18,350
you're alive you're like ok you know

1086
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:21,469
plant medicines are complex and you

1087
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:24,710
really need to look at at how you are

1088
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:29,959
gonna treat the human in a much more

1089
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:34,250
broad holistic way and I always feel bad

1090
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,650
for for these families because this is

1091
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:38,869
not the best time of their life to be

1092
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:42,320
learning detailed medicine that they're

1093
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:43,789
totally unfamiliar with and so you got

1094
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,720
out you got to walk them through this

1095
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:50,449
stuff very slowly and lovingly so that

1096
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:52,789
they can feel empowered to make

1097
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:57,079
decisions for themselves or their family

1098
00:47:52,789 --> 00:48:00,860
members at the same time that they are

1099
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:02,779
being incredibly frustrated yep exactly

1100
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,340
exactly and you know it's totally

1101
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,470
understandable that they're frustrated

1102
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,660
they want an easy solution and it this

1103
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:10,399
isn't an easy solution it's a really

1104
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:12,859
interesting one it could be a very

1105
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,750
powerful one but it's definitely not

1106
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:17,870
easy and it's not straightforward and

1107
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:20,000
it's it is asking a lot to to sort of

1108
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:22,489
introduce people to this concept that it

1109
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,590
it's gonna take time to figure out

1110
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:27,889
whether or not something works or not

1111
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:29,930
and in general I mean in the human

1112
00:48:27,889 --> 00:48:32,259
studies that have been conducted on THC

1113
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:35,149
and CBD and people with Parkinson's

1114
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:37,760
they're it's by and large there have

1115
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:40,190
been no worsening of symptoms you know

1116
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,520
at worst usually it's like nothing

1117
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:45,740
happens so if that's the worst-case

1118
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,190
scenario why not try it because the best

1119
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:51,829
case scenario can be incredible

1120
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:53,539
it could help cease some of the

1121
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:55,159
involuntary muscle movements it can make

1122
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:57,130
people happier I mean

1123
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:00,799
you know quality of life is huge and

1124
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:03,349
that's a stunning effect of cannabinoid

1125
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,420
therapy sort of across the board even if

1126
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:07,759
people don't observe any sort of

1127
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:10,789
metaphysical manifestations of cannabis

1128
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,560
therapy they feel better and that's

1129
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:14,480
really important yeah that's a very good

1130
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,179
point and I also like your point that

1131
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,119
you know nothing may happen at all but

1132
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:23,230
you're really only risking good you know

1133
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:26,239
most of the time not most the time every

1134
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:28,159
Parkinson's patient that I've ever you

1135
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:31,219
know become familiar with and taught a

1136
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,819
dosing protocol to if they fall into one

1137
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:36,139
of three categories either category one

1138
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,570
for whatever reason it doesn't seem to

1139
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:41,960
have any effect and they're frustrated

1140
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:43,430
by that and and that sucks but you know

1141
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,980
that's the that's the nature of the be

1142
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:50,449
so sometimes that's Basket one basket

1143
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:53,860
two are people who are able to relieve

1144
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:56,869
their daily symptoms to some degree and

1145
00:49:53,860 --> 00:50:00,590
maybe all the way which can be like a

1146
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:04,789
huge win but the the Parkinson's

1147
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:07,070
continues to progress over time and and

1148
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:08,989
you know they're not able to turn the

1149
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:12,289
tide on the Parkinson's and then there's

1150
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:14,569
the third category which is always

1151
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:17,179
delightful to run into where they

1152
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:20,059
they're very responsive to cannabinol

1153
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:24,469
Pathak medicine their their daily

1154
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:26,299
symptoms decrease right away and that

1155
00:50:24,469 --> 00:50:28,009
their treatment of the endocannabinoid

1156
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,460
system causes their body to start

1157
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:35,030
creating more neurons that create

1158
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:37,610
dopamine on on the body's own and then

1159
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:41,450
the the body's endocannabinoids system

1160
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:44,059
fires up and the Parkinson's rolls back

1161
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:47,539
and they're their tests numbers become

1162
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:49,340
better and and and everybody is

1163
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:51,529
astonished for the miracle cure and

1164
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,000
right you know and of course we hope

1165
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,910
that everybody's in that category but

1166
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,869
really I haven't come across a patient

1167
00:50:55,909 --> 00:51:04,399
yet who experimented with cannabis and

1168
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:07,369
it made them worse except for it's it's

1169
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,240
worth mentioning people who start taking

1170
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:11,838
th

1171
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:14,779
without following a specific dosing

1172
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:16,699
protocol can accidentally over medicate

1173
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,619
themselves and get more high than

1174
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:22,659
they're comfortable with and yeah and

1175
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:26,780
that can be you know an hour - of

1176
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:29,179
displeasure or you know more often than

1177
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,490
not people who are the age that people

1178
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:35,480
generally get Parkinson's I find that

1179
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:38,179
those people more go to sleep than then

1180
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:42,889
have a paranoid experience but you know

1181
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:45,199
it is it is like because you know once

1182
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:46,909
you once you're high one of the classic

1183
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:49,460
hallmarks of you know cannabis

1184
00:51:46,909 --> 00:51:51,559
intoxication is a loss of the ability to

1185
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:54,199
balance in the same way and since people

1186
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:56,329
with Parkinson's already have are sort

1187
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:58,480
of compromised in their ability to

1188
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:00,619
balance that could be definitely I've

1189
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,119
experienced patients who got really

1190
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:04,670
scared because they lost their balance

1191
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:07,130
when they were high and so that's like

1192
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:08,809
yeah totally understandable but again it

1193
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,269
has to do with you know that's too much

1194
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:13,369
you know you could take less definitely

1195
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:14,559
and I've run into actually actually many

1196
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:17,960
Parkinson's patients who are very

1197
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:20,588
sensitive to THC and it could have to do

1198
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,269
with the expression of cb1 in their

1199
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:25,730
cerebrospinal fluid they just have more

1200
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:28,099
targets for that THC to hit and so maybe

1201
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:30,260
they're getting high faster it's funny I

1202
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:31,760
had a I had one patient that I was

1203
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,869
working with and that was her primary

1204
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:39,230
complaint was that when she would take

1205
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:42,858
some purple flower THC in the evening

1206
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:45,858
before bed as a tincture so that she

1207
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:48,019
could get a good night's sleep and then

1208
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:49,880
and then you know maybe two two and a

1209
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:52,519
half hours she would normally get up to

1210
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,950
use the restroom and the THC was in her

1211
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:57,739
body and and she felt a little unstable

1212
00:52:54,949 --> 00:53:00,230
going to the restroom and and I told her

1213
00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:03,919
I said I said you know that that is a

1214
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:06,289
thing for some people and so you know

1215
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,349
let's decrease your dosage and she was

1216
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:14,630
like uh-uh and I said oh and she said I

1217
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:16,490
just put a like a bar on the wall and I

1218
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:19,940
and I like a railing and she said I

1219
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:21,618
added a railing between my bed and the

1220
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,869
bathroom and I hold on to that she says

1221
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:27,079
because it's so important for her to

1222
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:29,119
take THC at night at that dosage so that

1223
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,950
she wakes up in the morning hungry and

1224
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,829
I'm all like my gosh

1225
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:37,399
see this is this is the next this is

1226
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:39,980
next level patient self care where they

1227
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:43,789
have learned how the cannabis medicine

1228
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:45,579
works for them uniquely and and she was

1229
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:48,710
causing you know she was getting

1230
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:51,289
individualized medicine after she

1231
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:54,199
learned how to properly use the tincture

1232
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:56,119
for her and and people just need to be

1233
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:58,338
patient through those first couple weeks

1234
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:01,309
of learning how the how to use the

1235
00:53:58,338 --> 00:54:03,318
medicine best for you and then you can

1236
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:05,359
take the advice from you know your

1237
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:07,909
doctor or somebody like you or I and

1238
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:10,848
adapt it for you and now you've got like

1239
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:13,578
best practices for you and rec that is

1240
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:16,130
the you know gold standard for using

1241
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:19,130
cannabis totally and it is I mean it's

1242
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:21,140
it's a lot of experimentation and it can

1243
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:25,450
take a little bit of time and you know

1244
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:28,159
having patience can really turn out well

1245
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:30,528
yes alright so before we go to

1246
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:34,818
commercial I want to talk about the the

1247
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:36,498
use of cannabis to relieve short-term

1248
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:38,420
symptoms and we've already touched on a

1249
00:54:36,498 --> 00:54:41,088
bunch of this but you know generally up

1250
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:44,470
to the now we've been talking about you

1251
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:47,480
know fighting Parkinson's as the disease

1252
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:51,018
to try to get rid of it you know to get

1253
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:55,400
rid of the underlying lack of dopamine

1254
00:54:51,018 --> 00:54:58,189
issues but you know for many folks the

1255
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,470
initial cessation or lessening of

1256
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:03,200
physical symptoms that gives them their

1257
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:05,538
first confirmation of hope in cannabis

1258
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,518
is just taking a little bit that a

1259
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:09,920
friend gives them and you know many of

1260
00:55:07,518 --> 00:55:12,318
us have seen the the internet video of a

1261
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,048
Parkinson's patient with significant

1262
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:17,690
tremors being given just a tiny bit of

1263
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:19,130
cannabis oil on their tongue and then

1264
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,869
like within four or five minutes those

1265
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:22,970
tremors are gone and they're chatting

1266
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:25,400
and you know their friends they're

1267
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:26,988
crying and it's like powerful you know

1268
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,289
videos yeah and and you know there's

1269
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:32,900
there's plenty of these on YouTube that

1270
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:34,830
people can check out seeing that happen

1271
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,559
in person with the patient it really

1272
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:40,349
is breathtaking and so let's talk about

1273
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:43,320
like the short-term what symptoms have

1274
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:44,489
you seen abated with cannabis in the

1275
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,410
short-term

1276
00:55:44,489 --> 00:55:49,079
and when I say short-term I mean like

1277
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:50,699
you take some tincture you know

1278
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:53,730
consistently let's say every three or

1279
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:55,649
four hours and the symptoms go away you

1280
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:58,380
know to some degree within a day and

1281
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:59,210
then more so day two so very very Swift

1282
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,630
response

1283
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:05,940
totally tremors pain sleeplessness

1284
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:09,420
appetite all of those things I've seen

1285
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:12,210
return in Parkinson's patients and it

1286
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,610
really improves their quality of life

1287
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:16,050
not only that when when patients are

1288
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,340
eating properly because they've got

1289
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:20,400
their hunger back and they're getting a

1290
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:23,250
proper night's sleep it's helping the

1291
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,690
underlying systemic issues that are

1292
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,219
going on for them because none of us are

1293
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:29,880
gonna thrive with crappy food and crappy

1294
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:34,349
sleep and also the quality of life

1295
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,480
shoots up okay mark yeah the anxiety and

1296
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:38,789
depression is such a big issue for

1297
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:42,360
everyone who lives with chronic disease

1298
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:45,300
and so if you can manage that with

1299
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,590
cannabis it's huge yeah so okay so when

1300
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,840
we get back from the commercial we're

1301
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:51,890
gonna get right down to specific

1302
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:54,030
cannabis dosing protocols and methods

1303
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:56,309
but right now we're gonna take our

1304
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:57,690
second short break and be right back you

1305
00:56:56,309 --> 00:56:59,489
are listening to shaping fire and my

1306
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:03,659
guest today is cannabis researcher and

1307
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:05,549
educator Zoe Sigmund growing cannabis in

1308
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:07,379
greenhouses is taking over the cannabis

1309
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:10,200
industry an efficient and effective

1310
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,329
blend of sunshine grown terpene profiles

1311
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,429
and the controlled environment of indoor

1312
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:16,860
greenhouses can be the best of both

1313
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:18,960
worlds for many greenhouse operators

though building their greenhouse before

1316
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:26,340
greenhouses differ from ornamental crops

1317
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:28,349
can be the start of a world of hurt erik

impeccable

computation for both depth of knowledge

1330
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,780
and kindness and communication you can

1331
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,549
hear Eric explains some of the

1332
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,800
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses

matter where I go in the country good

1336
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,119
people with smart backgrounds still are

1337
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:11,280
making the mistake of building without

1338
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,679
knowing cannabis and it causes them to

1339
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,840
burn through capital and time fast

1340
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,149
everyone has their film failure point

1341
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,890
for some it is improper ventilation

1342
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,329
planning for others it is surface

1343
00:58:19,889 --> 00:58:24,059
temperatures of the building or the

1344
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:25,529
plants leaves or both some folks that

1345
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:27,539
build their greenhouse from scratch make

1346
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:29,190
really basic errors like placement of

1347
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:30,659
the greenhouse on the property or not

1348
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:32,280
understanding the natural environment

1349
00:58:30,659 --> 00:58:34,589
where the greenhouse sits

1350
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,750
some have even built a decent greenhouse

1351
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:38,250
but are inefficient in their deployment

1352
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,550
of light deprivation techniques and

1353
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:42,900
never really hit their target yields

1354
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:44,670
it's great when you learn from your

1355
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,920
mistakes but it's even better when you

1356
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:49,110
learn from the mistakes of others when

1357
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,760
you bring on greenhouse advisory group

1358
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:52,620
you will learn from the mistakes of

1359
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,270
their many clients and you'll take

1360

advantage of the best practices

every single day and often you just

1376
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,559
don't have the time to really dig into

to reach out to new customers and

1380
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,160
encourage loyalty and the customers you

1381
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:39,599
already have but you certainly don't

1382
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:41,369
have the time for it and you're not

1383
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,589
ready to hire somebody full-time for

1384
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:46,980

logo packaging and website very pretty

1390
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,429
but they leave responsibility for

1391
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,900
improving your bottom line up to you

1392

1393
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,318
responsibility but that's

1394
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,809

moon time medicinals dot-com Kirsten and

1412
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:44,219
her team put together a whole brand

1415
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:49,528
this is a paid commercial spot but that

1416
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:51,719
does not mean they bought my opinion

1417
01:00:49,528 --> 01:00:53,309
I've worked with blunt branding on five

1418
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:55,169
projects now for various of their

1419
01:00:53,309 --> 01:00:56,819
clients and every single time they have

1420
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:59,010
done more than they have promised and

1421
01:00:56,818 --> 01:01:01,139
over delivered on results I love how

1422
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:03,028
they generate new revenue and focus on

1423
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:05,940
that as the goal instead of just making

1424
01:01:03,028 --> 01:01:07,500
a pretty logo similarly every single

1425
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,460
friend I have referred them to has come

1426

gifts too i'm ashley Villafranca owner

1450
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:02,548
of the toke shop I came to cannabis as a

1451
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:04,679
patient seeking an alternative to the

1452
01:02:02,548 --> 01:02:07,528
pharmaceuticals being pushed at me for

1453
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:09,419
chronic pain and fibromyalgia I realized

1454
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:11,519
that not only was cannabis a huge help

1455
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,500
in controlling my symptoms but I found

1456
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,809
cannabis to be wonderfully social -

1457
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,119
cannabis makes friends

1458
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:20,250
so I took my love of jewelry design and

1459
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,440
blended it with my newfound passion for

1460
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,750
cannabis and began hand crafting

1461
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,000
bracelets earrings and friendship

1462
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,889
necklaces and then expanded to many

1463
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,280
clips rollin chase and other home

1464
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:32,670
furnishings all made in sterling silver

1465
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,260
14-karat gold

1466
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:36,720
and aluminum so there's something for

1467
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,850
everyone's budget I consider it all to

01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,230
with terpenes cannabinoids and other

1479
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,960
cannabis themes that's the toke shop see

1480
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:11,849
oh thanks welcome back you are listening

1481
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,960
to shaping fire I'm your host Shango

1482
01:03:11,849 --> 01:03:14,969
Louis and our guest this week is

1483
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,610
cannabis researcher and educator Zoe

1484
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:18,869
Sigmund so here we are at the part of

1485
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,090
the show that a lot of people have been

1486
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:24,869
waiting for I am sure we are going to go

1487
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:27,510
through specific dosing protocols to get

1488
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:30,239
you started with using cannabis to help

1489
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:31,980
treat your Parkinson's disease you know

1490
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,649
historically Parkinson's patients have

1491
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:37,920
been recommended to start with a air

1492
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:41,250
quotes 2 to 1 of 10 milligrams of CBD

1493
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,289
and 5 milligrams of THC every 3 to 4

1494
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:46,110
hours which is about the amount of time

1495
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:49,170
that the cannabinoids stay active in the

1496
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:49,710
bloodstream while a reasonable place to

1497
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,990
start

1498
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:53,780
even this basic dosage protocol though

1499
01:03:51,989 --> 01:03:56,399
has definitely has room for

1500
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:58,019
customization especially if the patient

1501
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,579
has never tried cannabis before I

1502
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:01,800
wouldn't want to start them out at 5

1503
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:04,500
milligrams so Zoe when you are

1504
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,150
consulting a new patient where do you

1505
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,909
like to suggest that they start with

1506
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:10,619
their cannabis dosing yeah I don't

1507
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:12,299
really suggest that they start lower

1508
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:14,489
than 5 grams so two and a half

1509
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:18,570
milligrams is a is a pretty good place

1510
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:21,149
to start even then I have had people

1511
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:23,580
with Parkinson's disease say that that

1512
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:25,650
was pretty significantly altering and so

1513
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:28,469
if people are nervous about the feeling

1514
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:30,568
of being high start with one

1515
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:32,969
of THC I'd still say at least 10

1516
01:04:30,568 --> 01:04:35,009
milligrams of CBD you can basically take

1517
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:38,309
as much CBD as you're comfortable with

1518
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:41,220
taking CP there's a lot of information

1519
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:44,009
about CBD for Parkinson's patients

1520
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:48,539
clinical studies and observations that

1521
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:50,369
show dosage dosages really up to the 600

1522
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:54,210
milligrams of CBD have been shown to

1523
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:56,910
have benefit in various aspects of the

1524
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:58,230
disease as far as the THC is concerned

1525
01:04:56,909 --> 01:05:00,480
we really want to avoid people feeling

1526
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:02,670
uncomfortable and so two-and-a-half

1527
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,039
milligrams one milligram if you're

1528
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:07,470
really nervous the first time you take

1529
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,358
cannabis medicine we really hope that

1530
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:12,809
you don't feel anything because that

1531
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:15,750
means you can increase your dose and it

1532
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:20,719
also means that they you know there are

1533
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:23,130
very very rare people I have had

1534
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:27,389
canvassed researchers suggest me that

1535
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:31,680
maybe it's 1 in 10,000 people who have a

1536
01:05:27,389 --> 01:05:34,588
severe reaction to THC where they'll

1537
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:37,529
take a very small amount of it you know

1538
01:05:34,588 --> 01:05:39,900
of two and a half milligrams and they

1539
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:43,170
will have an outside response to it and

1540
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:45,809
get really high for a few hours and it

1541
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:48,559
is is incredibly rare and I've only come

1542
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:51,059
across one person in all of my years

1543
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:54,809
talking with cannabis patients who is

1544
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:56,549
that sensitive but if it's you or if

1545
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:59,940
it's a family member or if you're a

1546
01:05:56,550 --> 01:06:03,810
caregiver you don't want to be the one

1547
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:06,179
that finds that rare patient and so if

1548
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:09,710
if the if the patient does not have an

1549
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:13,529
experience with THC starting at

1550
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:14,789
incredibly small what what regular

1551
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:17,130
cannabis patients would consider

1552
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:19,259
laughable starting with those laughable

1553
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:21,210
amounts really is the best way to go and

1554
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,500
and we'll talk more about method later

1555
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:26,039
but this is one of the reasons why I

1556
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:29,039
really like tinctures for patients

1557
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:30,929
because if if you're if you're smoking

1558
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,599
you can't control your dosage at all and

1559
01:06:30,929 --> 01:06:36,358
if you're taking a concentrated oil it's

1560
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,039
really hard to get low doses and if

1561
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:40,348
you're taking capsules you're stuck with

1562
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:41,699
whatever's in that capsule but if you

1563
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:44,190
are taking a tincture

1564
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:45,809
you can take a full dropper you can take

1565
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:48,720
a half a dropper or you can just take

1566
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:51,239
three little drops whatever is

1567
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:54,359
convenient for you and that is how we

1568
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:58,529
would get to as you suggested a 2.5

1569
01:06:54,360 --> 01:07:00,990
milligram THC dosage or if the person

1570
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:03,750
hasn't had any at all maybe maybe just

1571
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:05,789
give them you know ten drops which is

1572
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:07,440
gonna make her you know you'd have to do

1573
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:09,269
the math based on what's on the bottom

1574
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,039
what it says on the bottle right but

1575
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:13,259
let's just say that ten drops is going

1576
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,420
to be one milligram perhaps well let's

1577
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,490
let's start there because you can always

1578
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:19,470
increase your dosage and once it's in

1579
01:07:17,489 --> 01:07:23,179
your body it's much harder coming back

1580
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:26,909
and saying exactly doing a healthy self

1581
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:30,239
titration of moving up until you find

1582
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:33,509
your sweet spot is is really a way to go

1583
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:36,059
so so Zoey how do you recommend people

1584
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:37,500
find their sweet spot and how do they

1585
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:40,650
know when they've hit their sweet spot

1586
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:43,650
of the right amount of THC to take yeah

1587
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:45,809
I mean it's it it varies from person to

1588
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:47,970
person and I think that a really good

1589
01:07:45,809 --> 01:07:50,670
metric that I've used for a long time is

1590
01:07:47,969 --> 01:07:54,089
basically you want to feel relief of

1591
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:56,369
your symptoms without any unwanted side

1592
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:57,630
effects so that could mean different

1593
01:07:56,369 --> 01:07:59,639
things for different people for some

1594
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:02,400
people you know maybe you're looking for

1595
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:05,309
a lessening of pain but you don't want

1596
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,059
to feel high and so you would continue

1597
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:11,400
to slowly titrate up to the place where

1598
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:13,769
maybe you've been feeling pain relief or

1599
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,630
in some way for a little bit of time and

1600
01:08:13,769 --> 01:08:18,149
then finally you hit a dose where you're

1601
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:20,550
like ooh I feel high so move back down

1602
01:08:18,149 --> 01:08:23,759
so it's always a really good idea to

1603
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:26,130
keep track of exactly how much of any

1604
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:28,500
cannabis medicine you're taking and then

1605
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:31,230
sort of recording what your experiences

1606
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,329
are on that medication or at that dosage

1607
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:35,129
level so that if you hit a point at

1608
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:38,159
which you're uncomfortable you can back

1609
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:40,500
it down to the last step and it's good

1610
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,539
to point out that it isn't like if you

1611
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,670
add one more drop you go from not

1612
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:46,319
feeling it to being like super stoned

1613
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:48,510
right you know there's there's a

1614
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,429
progression of not feeling anything not

1615
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:52,469
feeling anything maybe you had a couple

1616
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:54,179
sips of wine um

1617
01:08:52,469 --> 01:08:55,469
and then maybe you had a glass amount

1618
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:58,679
and then oh maybe it would maybe you

1619
01:08:55,469 --> 01:09:00,239
actually had a martini intoxication and

1620
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:03,449
then oh maybe now you're kind of

1621
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:05,309
slapping at light switches or grasping

1622
01:09:03,448 --> 01:09:07,379
at the doorknob and then you're really

1623
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:10,080
high right you know like so yeah so

1624
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:13,650
there's this range that so long as you

1625
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:16,408
start on the low end you can tiptoe your

1626
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:18,298
way up and and what I have found is that

1627
01:09:16,408 --> 01:09:20,189
there are there are many many

1628
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:22,048
Parkinson's patients who tell me that

1629
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:24,568
they don't want to feel high and they're

1630
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:28,079
afraid of feeling high and so they'll

1631
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:31,048
titrate in one milligram two milligram

1632
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,939
three milligram and then someone around

1633
01:09:31,048 --> 01:09:35,579
four milligram when they start to

1634
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:38,039
actually feel anything at all they're

1635
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:40,559
all like oh I really like the warm

1636
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:43,859
sensation that I get from it

1637
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,259
and then at five you know or six they're

1638
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:48,869
all like they're like oh you know I have

1639
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:51,149
I really enjoy this it really makes my

1640
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:53,250
TV much more interesting we had laughs

1641
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:57,079
last night right and like you know and

1642
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:59,729
generally speaking unless somebody is

1643
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:02,250
you know very familiar with cannabis

1644
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:04,709
medicine there really isn't any reason

1645
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:07,380
for a novice to really go much beyond

1646
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:10,618
five or six milligrams unless they are

1647
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:12,150
experienced and unless there is either

1648
01:10:10,618 --> 01:10:14,250
they've got some kind of resistance that

1649
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:17,069
they've built up over time or if they're

1650
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:19,500
dealing with a contain component and

1651
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:22,109
they want to take a lot more THC to deal

1652
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,760
with that but but you know if you're if

1653
01:10:22,109 --> 01:10:26,368
you're just getting your legs under you

1654
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,289
and learning about using cannabis for

1655
01:10:26,368 --> 01:10:29,339
your Parkinson's you know generally

1656
01:10:28,289 --> 01:10:31,408
speaking you don't really have much

1657
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:33,270
business going above five until you know

1658
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:35,129
what you're doing because anyway

1659
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:38,520
anywhere above five you could have a

1660
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:41,489
surprised overmedication experience once

1661
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:43,110
you're a an established cannabis patient

1662
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:45,959
though you know pretty much anything

1663
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:48,658
under 10 is going to be pretty safe and

1664
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:50,460
then and then it's okay to play with

1665
01:10:48,658 --> 01:10:52,649
even more than that - it's it's

1666
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:54,750
absolutely sort of what you feel and if

1667
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:57,658
it's effective and you know people do

1668
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:59,609
balloons THC and so if you're using it

1669
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:01,408
every day you might need to increase

1670
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:03,658
your dose in it if you go above ten

1671
01:11:01,408 --> 01:11:05,399
that's that's fine it's not scary it

1672
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:05,879
just depends on your body and what you

1673
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:07,379
need

1674
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,619
yeah I think that's the kicker right

1675
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:12,900
it's it's not scary so long as you have

1676
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:14,849
built up the experience to get to that

1677
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:16,739
point I mean there's there's plenty of

1678
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:19,200
cannabis patients that are taking a

1679
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:21,630
hundred milligrams of THC in an edible

1680
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:23,760
at once but you know it's it's not their

1681
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:26,690
first time taking cannabis right these

1682
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,980
are these are patients that have been

1683
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:30,419
that they have learned how cannabis

1684
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:32,250
works with their body and they learned

1685
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,829
how to do it and when to do it and

1686
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:37,260
they're very experienced but but for the

1687
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:40,680
vast majority of people who are coming

1688
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:43,020
to cannabis everything all of our work

1689
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:45,930
on THC is going to be done under five

1690
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:49,980
milligrams and you know generally

1691
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:52,500
speaking as much CV whole plant CBD as

1692
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:54,329
you can afford and it's it's a it's a

1693
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,430
shame that it has to be that way because

1694
01:11:54,329 --> 01:11:59,479
you know the cheap stuff that the

1695
01:11:56,430 --> 01:12:02,220
affordable CVD is is very often

1696
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:05,099
questionably made isolate from other

1697
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:07,800
countries and such which are not going

1698
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,930
to give you the benefits of entourage

1699
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:13,320
effect and and really working with the

1700
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:16,350
whole system of the body the the whole

1701
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:18,269
plant preparations they're more arduous

1702
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:22,350
to make and you know their prices

1703
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:24,030
generally reflect that but thankfully

1704
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:27,289
they seek to be more effective or as

1705
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:30,689
effective at lower doses as CBD isolates

1706
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:34,319
higher doses and so you can play around

1707
01:12:30,689 --> 01:12:36,960
I mean I think that it is beneficial for

1708
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:39,090
almost everyone to take a pretty large

1709
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,260
amount of CBD at some point in their

1710
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:44,119
life as long as you're not on

1711
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:47,449
medications that stress your liver and

1712
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:49,890
see what it's like and then sort of

1713
01:12:47,449 --> 01:12:52,679
start to understand what different

1714
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:54,750
amounts of CBD can give you as far as

1715
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:57,390
benefits and it's you know in

1716
01:12:54,750 --> 01:13:00,810
Parkinson's patients there's been a ton

1717
01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:03,990
of human observations about like CBD

1718
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:06,510
improving quality of life spasms sleep

1719
01:13:03,989 --> 01:13:09,510
quality like all these issues and it's

1720
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:12,449
like you it's anywhere from 40

1721
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:14,730
milligrams per day up to 600 milligrams

1722
01:13:12,449 --> 01:13:16,679
per day and usually like a lot of the

1723
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:18,750
studies are at around 150 milligrams

1724
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:22,710
which is kind of a lot when you're

1725
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:25,380
about how CBD is usually sold how much

1726
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:27,630
CBD is usually in a tincture bottle but

1727
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:30,000
it's just to say like if you can afford

1728
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:33,449
it if you can find like a high quality

1729
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,430
preparation go for it and and also it's

1730
01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:37,679
unfortunate too because so many of the

1731
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:43,920
products on the shelves in license

1732
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:47,280
stores they will they will make a an

1733
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:50,730
extraction of a THC plant and then they

1734
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:54,929
will spike it with CBD isolate so that

1735
01:13:50,729 --> 01:13:58,049
they can get like huge CBD numbers but

1736
01:13:54,930 --> 01:14:00,450
it's not really a whole CBD plant and so

1737
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:03,630
so often people you know I will often

1738
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:05,309
recommend that a you know it taking

1739
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:07,680
taking the cost off the table for a

1740
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:09,630
minute if they can afford it go ahead

1741
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:12,690
and start with their two point five

1742
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:15,329
milligrams of THC but plan on five

1743
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:18,299
milligrams a dosage to be your target

1744
01:14:15,329 --> 01:14:22,579
and then if you can take 10 to 20

1745
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:26,489
milligrams of whole plant CBD with that

1746
01:14:22,579 --> 01:14:29,880
3 to 4 times a day so that you end up

1747
01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:33,329
with you know between 60 and 100

1748
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:37,260
milligrams of whole plant CBD and you

1749
01:14:33,329 --> 01:14:41,340
know 15 to 20 milligrams of THC spread

1750
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:44,070
out over the whole day you're gonna very

1751
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:46,529
likely see a significant benefit right

1752
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:48,809
because you're giving you're giving a

1753
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:50,789
healthy dose consistently throughout the

1754
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:53,970
day and you are rebuilding your

1755
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:56,010
endocannabinoid system and so just

1756
01:14:53,970 --> 01:15:01,199
because some of the studies that we've

1757
01:14:56,010 --> 01:15:06,030
seen are you know 200 milligrams and up

1758
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:09,359
and day many of these studies are still

1759
01:15:06,029 --> 01:15:12,329
being done on rats and the the dosing

1760
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,920
does not always actually the CBD studies

1761
01:15:12,329 --> 01:15:15,000
in Parkinson's it's in humans that's

1762
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,800
what's really impressive about

1763
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,840
Parkinson's disease like there's a bunch

1764
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,579
of preclinical stuff in rats like really

1765
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,989
interesting stuff with CBD but the the

1766
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:23,880
dosages I was talking about those are

1767
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:25,260
all based on humans all right so then my

1768
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,400
follow up to that would have been since

1769
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,619
since you're more familiar with these

1770
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:30,839
studies are they always using whole

1771
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:32,489
plant are they using isolate yeah

1772
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,140
excellent question

1773
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:38,819
that information is almost never

1774
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:40,920
provided yeah yeah and so so it's

1775
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:47,489
interesting you know people people will

1776
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:51,029
often get you know poor or no results on

1777
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:54,329
a few hundred milligrams of CBD isolate

1778
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:56,519
but you give that same patient twenty

1779
01:15:54,329 --> 01:15:58,529
five milligrams of whole plant and oh my

1780
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,870
gosh suddenly it works because the body

1781
01:15:58,529 --> 01:16:05,429
knows how to deal with that instead of

1782
01:16:00,869 --> 01:16:08,579
just quality questions I think I feel

1783
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:12,860
like in CBD isolate in the world of CBD

1784
01:16:08,579 --> 01:16:17,189
isolate you're a little bit more

1785
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:19,889
susceptible to fraud honestly you know

1786
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:21,929
people just miss labeling what's in the

1787
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:24,329
bottle and misrepresenting was in the

1788
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:26,850
bottle and you do need to be careful

1789
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:29,250
about who you buy your products from for

1790
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:32,039
that reason no one's regulating this and

1791
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:33,779
so you need to trust the person who

1792
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:35,250
makes the oil the person who grows the

1793
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:37,649
flower in the flower that goes into the

1794
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:40,319
oil it's a it's a bit more of an

1795
01:16:37,649 --> 01:16:42,899
involved process than other medications

1796
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:45,090
definitely and another place that

1797
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:48,269
patients get super frustrated right

1798
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:51,960
because you know there's so many places

1799
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:54,000
for for things to go wrong on the path

1800
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,760
from the plant being in the ground to

1801
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,380
being in your hands at home you know

1802
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,690
there's there's potential pesticides

1803
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:02,699
that are being used at the grower step

1804
01:17:00,689 --> 01:17:04,500
and then you've got you know some

1805
01:17:02,699 --> 01:17:06,960
extraction methods are better than other

1806
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,159
like I'm a big fan of ethanol extraction

1807
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,739
because it really pulls out the whole

1808
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:13,229
plant but if you can't get ethanol you

1809
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:15,119
know I would probably go and try some

1810
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:16,859
you know co2 extraction though that is

1811
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:18,869
not my personal preference I'd always go

1812
01:17:16,859 --> 01:17:20,609
to the ethanol first but then you can

1813
01:17:18,869 --> 01:17:23,130
come all the way down to people using

1814
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:27,960
distillates and isolates and and spiking

1815
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:29,670
a THC cultivar and and so most patients

1816
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:32,250
are not going to be sophisticated enough

1817
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:33,569
to be able to unravel that and so then

1818
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:34,260
they go to a store and they ask a

1819
01:17:33,569 --> 01:17:38,849
budtender

1820
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:41,699
and there are some epic bud tenders who

1821
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:43,320
you know it's more than a job for them

1822
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,769
they are doing their research at home

1823
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:46,989
and they're going to convention

1824
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:49,990
and they're learning stuff but that is

1825
01:17:46,989 --> 01:17:53,260
the minority and very often than not the

1826
01:17:49,989 --> 01:17:55,539
budtender will give you what they have a

1827
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:59,110
lot of in stock or what other people

1828
01:17:55,539 --> 01:18:02,229
tend to buy neither of those are based

1829
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:05,259
on medical efficacy really right right

1830
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:07,599
which is it's just it's a problem it's

1831
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:10,150
one of the main problems of cannabis

1832
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:13,060
medicine you know getting a consistent

1833
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:14,859
product that you can trust contains what

1834
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:17,560
you think it contains and making sure

1835
01:18:14,859 --> 01:18:18,819
that that product works for you so I hit

1836
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:21,190
on it a little bit earlier about the

1837
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:24,729
different methods and it's so common for

1838
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:26,500
me to come across patients who are first

1839
01:18:24,729 --> 01:18:28,689
trying to get familiar with cannabis

1840
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:31,689
medicine and so somebody gives them some

1841
01:18:28,689 --> 01:18:36,099
joints to smoke and and certainly there

1842
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:39,460
are you know some ailments that smoking

1843
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:43,900
is very appropriate you know depression

1844
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:46,859
glaucoma pain loss of appetite you know

1845
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:50,019
these types of things you know certainly

1846
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:53,229
you know smoking a joint it will work

1847
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:56,380
but but for Parkinson's we really want

1848
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:58,929
to be in more control of the dosing and

1849
01:18:56,380 --> 01:19:01,150
being able to fine-tune it and know

1850
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:04,180
exactly how much we took and write it in

1851
01:19:01,149 --> 01:19:06,759
our patient journal so that we can

1852
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:10,150
control our doses better over time so

1853
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:12,460
when when folks are asking you what your

1854
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:14,289
preferred methods are for actually

1855
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:19,350
ingesting it what do you like to tell

1856
01:19:14,289 --> 01:19:21,399
them usually sublingually so sublingual

1857
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:25,480
administration involves holding a

1858
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:27,909
tincture or spray under your tongue for

1859
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:29,769
a minute to allow some of the active

1860
01:19:27,909 --> 01:19:31,569
compounds in this case cannabinoids to

1861
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:34,960
pass through into your bloodstream more

1862
01:19:31,569 --> 01:19:37,090
readily this is in contrast to just

1863
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,260
swallowing a tincture which then needs

1864
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:40,810
to pass through your entire digestive

1865
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:43,690
system first and you actually lose a lot

1866
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:45,250
of the potency of the cannabinoids well

1867
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:47,799
it's passing through your digestive

1868
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:49,989
system and so the sublingual

1869
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:52,000
administration allows for a faster onset

1870
01:19:49,989 --> 01:19:55,800
and maybe a little bit more better

1871
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,800
absorption of the cannabinoids

1872
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:01,470
I have also and this is a bit

1873
01:19:59,069 --> 01:20:05,519
controversial but especially with people

1874
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:08,970
who are very concerned about cannabis

1875
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,750
use I have suggested maybe starting or

1876
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:14,640
trying a transdermal patch first

1877
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:16,859
transdermal patches have a lot of issues

1878
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,390
in terms of consistency people's skin

1879
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:18,979
are different thicknesses it's difficult

1880
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:21,360
to tell

1881
01:20:18,979 --> 01:20:24,929
really how bioavailable the compounds

1882
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:27,119
are but the benefit is you could put it

1883
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:28,950
on and feel the effects really quickly

1884
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:30,779
within 15 minutes and then if you don't

1885
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:33,569
like the effects you can take it off and

1886
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:35,399
then the effects will go away just as

1887
01:20:33,569 --> 01:20:37,920
quickly and so it's sort of a good way

1888
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:39,929
to see if if this is something that

1889
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,090
works for you they are very expensive so

1890
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:43,650
not like the best may be a long-term

1891
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:45,900
solution which is where you can start to

1892
01:20:43,649 --> 01:20:48,299
move into the land of sublingual

1893
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:51,329
administration and I'm still looking for

1894
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:54,090
a transdermal patch that I really like

1895
01:20:51,329 --> 01:20:56,460
what's in it - because yeah transdermal

1896
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:59,880
preparation that is a lot of heavy

1897
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:03,930
processing of the cannabinoids and and

1898
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:06,239
and to get to that point we're often you

1899
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:08,340
know we're often way beyond whole plant

1900
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:11,369
where we're in this kind of over

1901
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:13,020
processed version which at that point if

1902
01:21:11,369 --> 01:21:17,039
somebody's gonna go transdermal I

1903
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:18,510
actually like taking cannabis oil and

1904
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:20,609
mix it with a little bit of hand lotion

1905
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:23,699
and actually using it as a topical and

1906
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:27,210
letting it sum through the skin rather

1907
01:21:23,699 --> 01:21:29,869
than going transdermal but but I think

1908
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:31,789
that I don't think that the transdermal

1909
01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:35,010
[Music]

1910
01:21:31,789 --> 01:21:37,710
technology has come into its own yet I

1911
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:40,350
still think that as as more investment

1912
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:42,420
money comes into the cannabis world and

1913
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:45,000
we get more cross over for the

1914
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:47,039
scientists that that you know are really

1915
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,380
good at making them we're going to see

1916
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,119
more of them come to the market and who

1917
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:53,909
knows that transdermal may actually

1918
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:55,349
already exist in you know one of the

1919
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:58,829
medical states and I just haven't come

1920
01:21:55,350 --> 01:22:00,960
across that product yet yeah yeah I mean

1921
01:21:58,829 --> 01:22:02,159
the transdermal technology has advanced

1922
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,859
a law in the past several years and

1923
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:07,130
really outside of cannabis it's a very

1924
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:10,199
interesting administration method for

1925
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:12,630
very small molecules like nicotine and

1926
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:14,579
or estrogen for nicotine patches or

1927
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:16,770
birth control patches which is where

1928
01:22:14,579 --> 01:22:20,489
this sort of technology really evolved

1929
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:22,700
and so I have seen you know promising

1930
01:22:20,489 --> 01:22:25,590
suggestions for the transdermal

1931
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:27,090
technologies but yeah you're right like

1932
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:28,829
we still have a lot to learn as far as

1933
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:31,140
that administration method and tinctures

1934
01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:33,630
just really are very easy as far as

1935
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:36,990
dosage control which is awesome that

1936
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:40,020
said Parkinson's is one of the diseases

1937
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:41,819
where maybe because of the length of

1938
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:45,450
time that cannabis has been used to

1939
01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:47,670
treat Parkinson's there have been some

1940
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:50,189
studies that have shown benefits for

1941
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:54,569
from smoked cannabis especially as far

1942
01:22:50,189 --> 01:22:57,149
as mood and fatigue and pain and so if

1943
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:58,529
you're King if those are the symptoms

1944
01:22:57,149 --> 01:23:02,219
that you're really looking to help

1945
01:22:58,529 --> 01:23:03,599
mitigate in Parkinson's disease like

1946
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:05,430
smoking could be a really good option

1947
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,750
for you if you're open to it actually

1948
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:10,050
that's a really good point to make too

1949
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:13,199
because when I was kind of dissing from

1950
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:16,199
the smoking aspect I was thinking to get

1951
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:19,489
the cannabinoids unchanged into the body

1952
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:23,519
where it can cause neurogenesis of these

1953
01:23:19,489 --> 01:23:27,479
dopamine creating neurons right and so

1954
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:29,820
for specifically that sure a sublingual

1955
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:32,489
tincture or oil is going to be optimum

1956
01:23:29,819 --> 01:23:34,889
but you're right the symptoms that come

1957
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:40,679
with Parkinson's can very well be

1958
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:42,900
treated with a joint and especially the

1959
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:44,730
quality of life aspect I yeah I know a

1960
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:46,710
lot of Parkinson's patients that they

1961
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:48,449
have found that their favorite part of

1962
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:51,060
their day is sitting on their porch and

1963
01:23:48,449 --> 01:23:53,460
smoking a joint and just feeling not

1964
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:57,360
crappy for a while right totally it's

1965
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:59,180
really important I think another thing

1966
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:03,149
to note about anything that you ingest

1967
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:05,610
through your mouth is if you take your

1968
01:24:03,149 --> 01:24:07,920
cannabinoid medication with fad

1969
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:10,259
something fatty a fatty meal a fatty

1970
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,750
snack your body will absorb those

1971
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:15,300
cannabinoids like significantly better

1972
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:17,069
like two to three times better and so

1973
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:20,430
it's always worth noting that if you are

1974
01:24:17,069 --> 01:24:21,899
taking a tincture or an edible eat a

1975
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:23,940
spoonful of peanut butter or ice cream

1976
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:25,109
or an avocado or whatever to help

1977
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:27,179
really help your body absorb those

1978
01:24:25,109 --> 01:24:29,519
cannabinoids and this is not an excuse

1979
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:30,659
to eat cracky calories either right I

1980
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,520
mean like we're talking about a very

1981
01:24:30,659 --> 01:24:34,680
small amount of fat to the point that

1982
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:36,420
you know a lot of good capsules are made

1983
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:38,579
with a little bit of oil and a little

1984
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:39,390
bit of coconut as the fat and a capsule

1985
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:42,539
and that's it

1986
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:44,460
so this is this is not your ex you know

1987
01:24:42,539 --> 01:24:47,369
this is not the reason to take a little

1988
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:54,480
bit of cannabinoids and then a pint of

1989
01:24:47,369 --> 01:24:57,269
Ben &amp; Jerry's right your fat maybe a

1990
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,649
couple spoonfuls yeah there you go so um

1991
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:00,540
you know another thing I think we should

1992
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:03,329
hit on before we wrap up our

1993
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:06,899
conversation is that you know while you

1994
01:25:03,329 --> 01:25:09,710
and I have both seen huge successes for

1995
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:14,250
Parkinson's patients using cannabis and

1996
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:16,140
the vast majority of patients that I've

1997
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:17,729
come across who have you who have used

1998
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:19,860
cannabis have gotten some good results

1999
01:25:17,729 --> 01:25:21,779
to the point that that Parkinson's is

2000
01:25:19,859 --> 01:25:23,789
kind of low-hanging fruit for cannabis

2001
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:26,939
it's not it's it's it's one of the more

2002
01:25:23,789 --> 01:25:29,550
easily accessible and treatable diseases

2003
01:25:26,939 --> 01:25:31,859
with cannabis it doesn't work for

2004
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:35,329
everybody and and and and and it's

2005
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:38,880
important to be clear about that that

2006
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:40,948
sometimes folks will take cannabis and

2007
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,989
they just won't see the changes that

2008
01:25:40,948 --> 01:25:44,819
they want and they'll be like I don't

2009
01:25:42,988 --> 01:25:47,459
know why but it doesn't work for me and

2010
01:25:44,819 --> 01:25:50,909
and I don't have an explanation why it

2011
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:53,609
doesn't work for everybody but to know

2012
01:25:50,909 --> 01:25:55,050
that that is a possibility and sometimes

2013
01:25:53,609 --> 01:25:57,210
you also have to play around with the

2014
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:57,960
dosage and sometimes it's weird

2015
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:01,109
sometimes

2016
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:02,369
I jest that people like after they've

2017
01:26:01,109 --> 01:26:03,569
tried for a few weeks and they're like

2018
01:26:02,369 --> 01:26:05,460
it's just not working for me I'm like

2019
01:26:03,569 --> 01:26:07,738
well put put the rest of the cannabis

2020
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,329
medicine you have aside and like just

2021
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:11,009
take a break for a few weeks and then

2022
01:26:09,329 --> 01:26:12,539
come back to it and approach it again

2023
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:15,300
and sometimes it works if the second

2024
01:26:12,539 --> 01:26:17,189
time and sometimes it doesn't but I

2025
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:19,890
think that it's just I think it's

2026
01:26:17,189 --> 01:26:22,198
important for people to know that if

2027
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:24,900
they are going to give this a try

2028
01:26:22,198 --> 01:26:26,639
there are people that that they don't

2029
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:29,670
get the benefit that they are looking

2030
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:32,460
for while there are people who get

2031
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:36,149
incredible benefits so be gentle with

2032
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:37,659
yourself and and and take notes in your

2033
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:39,489
journal so you are sure

2034
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:41,590
you're taking enough because honestly

2035
01:26:39,489 --> 01:26:43,199
when people say they're not that the

2036
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:46,390
cannabis did not help their Parkinson's

2037
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:48,130
it's it's almost always the fact that

2038
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:51,010
they misunderstood the dosage and

2039
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:53,710
they're taking such a small amount that

2040
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:56,710
that it wouldn't help anybody right

2041
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:58,720
right yeah and I think a big an

2042
01:26:56,710 --> 01:27:00,310
important part of the jobs that both you

2043
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:03,130
and I do at helping patients is

2044
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:05,070
modulating expectations and trying to

2045
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:07,810
help people approach cannabis medicine

2046
01:27:05,069 --> 01:27:09,759
as realistically as possible and it is

2047
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:11,200
really important I mean many of the

2048
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,680
Parkinson's patients that I've worked

2049
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:16,510
with have not had benefit from cannabis

2050
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,950
therapy and that's okay and they were

2051
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:19,810
okay with it and part of the reason they

2052
01:27:17,949 --> 01:27:22,420
were okay with it was you know walking

2053
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:24,520
into it knowing that it doesn't work for

2054
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:26,590
everyone and there's a bunch of things

2055
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:30,220
that you can try and it's okay if it

2056
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:32,920
doesn't you know it might and that's

2057
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:36,190
where it's like modulate expectations

2058
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:39,039
and keep hope high you know and and and

2059
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:40,239
usually the by the time the people get

2060
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:42,550
to cannabis they've already tried

2061
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:44,590
everything else anyway you know and you

2062
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:48,699
know certainly there are some you know

2063
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:50,800
more nature medicine type folks who will

2064
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:53,470
start with cannabis and you know those

2065
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,880
are those are our kind of people but but

2066
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:56,530
that's that's not usually the case

2067
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,720
normally they've gone through all the

2068
01:27:56,529 --> 01:28:00,759
Pharma first and it either has got

2069
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,949
really bad side effects or it doesn't

2070
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:04,210
work for them and they're like okay what

2071
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:08,439
do you got what do you hippies got you

2072
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:10,449
know and and so we we educate them and

2073
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:13,869
and hopefully they find some advantage

2074
01:28:10,449 --> 01:28:17,069
there but even people who don't find

2075
01:28:13,869 --> 01:28:21,220
that the cannabis medicine is actually

2076
01:28:17,069 --> 01:28:25,239
helping reverse or rollback their

2077
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:27,550
Parkinson's at the root core their

2078
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:30,279
quality of lives is are almost always

2079
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:31,630
increased just because taking a little

2080
01:28:30,279 --> 01:28:33,460
bit of cannabis and the muscle

2081
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:36,489
relaxation aspects of it and getting

2082
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:38,350
your your you know getting the munchies

2083
01:28:36,489 --> 01:28:40,929
getting your appetite back and being a

2084
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:43,870
little stoned and for the vast majority

2085
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:46,270
of patients that in and of itself makes

2086
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:47,979
life better totally and it has been in

2087
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:50,350
some of the human studies on Parkinson's

2088
01:28:47,979 --> 01:28:51,559
disease both THC and CBD have helped

2089
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:53,600
people get off of pharmacy

2090
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:56,450
chuckle painkillers which is another

2091
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,850
huge benefit lucky if it's not helping

2092
01:28:56,449 --> 01:29:01,069
with Parkinson's directly you know

2093
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:02,660
helping you get off of opiates which

2094
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:05,750
might not make you feel very good I mean

2095
01:29:02,659 --> 01:29:08,930
like I have only taken opiates once and

2096
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:11,090
it made me puke for days you know and

2097
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:13,670
it's like but if that's your only option

2098
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:15,529
for pain relief having it another option

2099
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:16,640
is really nice and so it's like there's

2100
01:29:15,529 --> 01:29:18,469
all these things to take into

2101
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,880
consideration when you're considering

2102
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:22,699
whether or not cannabis medicine is

2103
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:25,819
effective yeah absolutely all right so

2104
01:29:22,699 --> 01:29:28,760
let's wrap this up because you know

2105
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:31,609
patients and families and educators who

2106
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:34,430
are still with us in the show they are

2107
01:29:31,609 --> 01:29:36,139
probably just lit with interest at this

2108
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:39,890
point and and they're probably gonna

2109
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:44,000
want to take this and learn more so so

2110
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:46,579
before I ask you for where you would

2111
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,029
recommend people to go I want to start

2112
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:52,670
by recommending your video that is on

2113
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:56,090
the shaping fire YouTube channel at

2114
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:58,670
youtube.com forward slash Angello's you

2115
01:29:56,090 --> 01:30:00,800
just gave a great talk at Vimeo on

2116
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:03,980
Vashon Island about getting to know your

2117
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:06,949
endocannabinoid system and it's great

2118
01:30:03,979 --> 01:30:10,849
you you expand for about an hour what we

2119
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:13,519
did in about 10 minutes today and not

2120
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:15,770
only is it is it playful and you know

2121
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:18,050
you're a humorous person but also you

2122
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:20,120
use you know Star Wars metaphors to

2123
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:23,119
explain the endocannabinoid system and

2124
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:25,640
so it makes it pretty delightful so so

2125
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:28,010
you so folks can check that out on on

2126
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:30,950
the shaping fire YouTube channel where

2127
01:30:28,010 --> 01:30:34,909
else do you like to send people Zoe to

2128
01:30:30,949 --> 01:30:37,039
learn more yeah project CBD which is the

2129
01:30:34,909 --> 01:30:39,139
nonprofit I worked for for a year and a

2130
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:41,119
half before I worked there I recommended

2131
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:42,740
people go there and now after I work

2132
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:45,409
there I recommend people go there I

2133
01:30:42,739 --> 01:30:47,300
think that's an incredible resource and

2134
01:30:45,409 --> 01:30:50,059
will continue to be so and I think that

2135
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:51,680
as far as putting out information that's

2136
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:53,600
accessible to people who are not

2137
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:56,420
necessarily scientists it's still one of

2138
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:58,940
the best I'm gonna go ahead and double

2139
01:30:56,420 --> 01:31:02,060
down on on your suggestion of project

2140
01:30:58,939 --> 01:31:03,739
CBD org which my listeners are certainly

2141
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:05,030
familiar with because it is the it's the

2142
01:31:03,739 --> 01:31:08,389
only web resource

2143
01:31:05,029 --> 01:31:10,429
that I plug consistently because as far

2144
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:15,020
as I'm concerned it is it is the only

2145
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:18,079
you know always trustworthy source for

2146
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:20,330
information that's been vetted plus you

2147
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:23,539
can get both kinds of articles you can

2148
01:31:20,329 --> 01:31:26,359
get articles that translate cannabis

2149
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:29,260
medicine and research into you know

2150
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:31,909
regular person vocabulary but also

2151
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:34,520
there's a section on the site called

2152
01:31:31,909 --> 01:31:35,960
conditions that you can click on I think

2153
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:39,470
there's like 50 different conditions

2154
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:41,869
there including Parkinson's and when you

2155
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:44,800
click on it you will get links to all of

2156
01:31:41,869 --> 01:31:48,349
the original scientific research on

2157
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:51,140
PubMed gov so if you're the kind of

2158
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:52,940
person where you know an article is not

2159
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:55,579
going to give you the level of

2160
01:31:52,939 --> 01:31:58,250
specificity that you need to make health

2161
01:31:55,579 --> 01:32:00,920
decisions for you and your family going

2162
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:02,689
to the project CBD org site under

2163
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:05,480
conditions and clicking Parkinson's and

2164
01:32:02,689 --> 01:32:08,000
getting access to the science firsthand

2165
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:09,649
oh you'll feel so much more satisfied

2166
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,840
with the with the path that you take

2167
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:14,059
knowing that you have read the science

2168
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,710
yourself firsthand oh yeah it's

2169
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:17,840
wonderful and I mean like if people

2170
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:20,510
really want to get into it pull up

2171
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:23,650
PubMed and search Parkinson's in

2172
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:26,510
cannabis and PubMed is a database that

2173
01:32:23,649 --> 01:32:29,599
collates all of the scientific research

2174
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:33,500
that's being done I'm pretty sure gone

2175
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:35,930
everything but if you open it and search

2176
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:39,380
for a specific specific condition and

2177
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:41,829
cannabis there's thousands of articles

2178
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:45,289
and it could be a really useful resource

2179
01:32:41,829 --> 01:32:47,029
fantastic so Zoe thank you so much for

2180
01:32:45,289 --> 01:32:49,460
taking the time out of your schedule to

2181
01:32:47,029 --> 01:32:51,920
hang out for a little bit and to share

2182
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:54,319
your vast experience on this topic and

2183
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,720
and you know thank you for sharing your

2184
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:59,840
experience working with patients

2185
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:03,829
directly because you know often there is

2186
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:07,489
a gap between the the scientific papers

2187
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:09,409
and how patients find relief and I

2188
01:33:07,489 --> 01:33:11,300
appreciate you that you have got both

2189
