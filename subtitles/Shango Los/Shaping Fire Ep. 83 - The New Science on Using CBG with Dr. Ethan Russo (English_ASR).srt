00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,839
we all love thc it consoles us when we

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,919
are hurt it soothes our pain when we are

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,599
injured it opens our mind and gives us

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,719
big thoughts and it makes us better

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,278
humans

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,839
when cbd cannabidiol entered our

8
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,759
awareness in the early 2000s cannabis

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,160
caregivers and patients quickly learned

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,560
of the incredible benefits that cbd had

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,399
on an array of ailments because it

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,479
interacted so effectively with the

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,320
endocannabinoid system

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,919
when i speak to patient groups around

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,799
the country there is usually someone in

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,760
the group who has some version of how

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,439
can cbd help so many medical problems

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,558
you talk about it like it's a magical

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,640
potion

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,718
and it's true that the list of physical

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,439
problems that cbd helps with seems

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,000
unrealistic but i tell folks that cbd

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,920
really only helps one thing

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,558
it supports and strengthens the

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,640
endocannabinoid system the healing

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,640
gained is because the endocannabinoid

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,558
system is the body's master regulator

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,439
for all the major systems

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,280
so if you help the master regulator you

30
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,279
keep your body more in balance and

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,680
lessen the impact of a wide range of

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,680
ailments simply because you have gassed

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
up the regulating mechanism and it can

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,280
now do its job more effectively

35
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,599
with the popularity of cbd new research

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,640
is now just beginning into several other

37
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:30,719
novel cannabinoids including cbg

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,640
cannabidirol and cbg2 acts system-wide

39
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,039
through the endocannabinoid system in

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,759
similar ways as cbd

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,840
cbg has many benefits for folks looking

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,399
to get relief and today we're going to

titled survey of patients employing

119
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,279
cannabidiol predominant cannabis

120
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,000

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,120
welcome to the show ethan

123
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,680
good to be back right on so

124
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,478
we're gonna talk mostly about this uh

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,600
new comprehensive survey that you and

126
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:40,079
your co-authors have published um but

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,479
before we do that um let's spend the

128
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,198
first set in talking specifically about

129
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,360
cbg so that everybody understands

130
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,520
a little more significantly the impact

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,759
of the survey when we get to it

132
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,599
so you know while cbg is only really

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,160
getting popular now when did we first

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,160
discover and isolate cannabigirl and

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,800
knew that it existed

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:06,479
well that goes clear back to 1964.

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,199
as with many other items pertinent to

138
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,758
cannabis and cannabinoid science

139
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
professor masholum was there

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,400
with his

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,439
partner yahil gayoni who

142
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,599
died

143
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:25,680
i think three years ago at about age 90.

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,439
but they isolated cannabidiol in 1964

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,360
from

146
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,879
hashish that

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,038
was seized

148
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,399
by the government and it was of lebanese

149
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,240
origin

150
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,159
but even then

151
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,680
as is so often the case professor

152
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,720
misholum was very prescient about what

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,199
might happen and he called canaba gerald

154
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,680
the missing link in the plant synthesis

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,160
of cannabinoid constituents

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,759
so he knew right away that this was sort

157
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,280
of the mother of of all cannabinoids um

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,199
was the precursor to the the rest

159
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,399
and that turned out to be absolutely

160
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,840
correct

161
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,198
so so what is the reason that he

162
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,879
determined it was the mother of

163
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,520
cannabinoids

164
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,360
well uh in looking at the chemistry it

165
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,399
seemed that other things would be

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,080
derived from it and i imagine that this

167
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,079
was based on the structure

168
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,360
but uh

169
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,439
certainly uh

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,120
i don't know how he did it but he turned

171
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,839
out to be right is in so many things

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,319
so

173
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,599
it was discovered um

174
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,840
uh dr mushulum realizes that this is a

175
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,919
significant discovery

176
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,599
and then all of a sudden they're like

177
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,279
there's this big period where there's

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,800
not a lot of research what do we

179
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,439
attribute that that to is that is that

180
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,120
directly related to prohibition or was

181
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,439
like nobody really interested

182
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,759
well combination of a couple of things

183
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,918
first was prohibition

184
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,639
uh by this time

185
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:59,439
cannabis was already illegal most places

186
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,439
and then more formally so

187
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,680
with a single convention treaty which

188
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,839
followed a few years later

189
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,879
but the main reason was all the

190
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,758
bandwidth was taken up by thc

191
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,478
and because in initial studies which

192
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,680
took place in 1969

193
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,038
they started giving cannabidirl to dogs

194
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,319
monkeys

195
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:26,159
mice and rats and didn't see any really

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,639
uh overt behavioral changes and so

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,800
uh it just didn't get any attention

198
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,478
until much later

199
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
so back in the days like that they would

200
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,639
have been giving them

201
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,560
um cbg isolate correct and not in the

202
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,680
company of other cannabinoids

203
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,519
yeah very likely uh of course there'd be

204
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,720
small amounts that might be present if

205
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,918
someone were using hashish or other

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,000
forms of cannabis but one of the quirks

207
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,478
um and that this could be another reason

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
that it wasn't studied so much

209
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,800
normally

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,598
cbg doesn't accumulate much

211
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
in

212
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,159
cannabis plants

213
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,239
it sort of is a high throat throughput

214
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
stop on the way to the other

215
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,478
cannabinoids

216
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:14,799
in other words as soon as it's made

217
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:16,959
most frequently the plant goes on to thc

218
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
or cbd

219
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,000
but

220
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,400
now with selective breeding that

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,199
situation is changing and we'll

222
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,439
get to that more later i'm sure

223
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,919
for sure we are and

224
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,399
when you so what do you mean um high

225
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,838
throughput stoppage i think is how you

226
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,679
put it

227
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,839
well uh again uh so there are enzymes

228
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,278
that result in the production of

229
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,480
cannabidiol or actually cannabidiolic

230
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,120
acid

231
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,639
which is what the plant makes before

232
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,440
decarboxylation

233
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,559
the loss of co2 molecule

234
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,800
but again normally it doesn't stop there

235
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,838
the more enzymes that will lead to

236
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,958
production of thc and cbd

237
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,080
and so

238
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,439
in most cannabis samples when they're

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,879
analyzed

240
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,040
you see either no cbg or very small

241
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,958
amounts well well under one percent

242
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,838
so one of the things that we know about

243
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:20,559
um you know the variety of cannabinoids

244
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,040
that have been researched is that they

245
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,000
they work on different receptors in

246
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,000
different ways which um

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,679
kind of suggests

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,440
what they might be used for um what are

249
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:39,838
the different actions and receptors that

250
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,760
cbg acts on and and is it similar to any

251
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,760
of the other cannabinoids

252
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,000
no it's it's really distinct i mean

253
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,080
there are some uh

254
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
some overlaps in terms of the things

255
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,080
that it seems to be good for which we'll

256
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,839
talk about later

257
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,440
but straight out of the shoot it's

258
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,880
important to mention

259
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,920
that cbg does not seem to work directly

260
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:05,360
on the cannabinoid receptors at least

261
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,879
not cb1 and cb2 which are normally

262
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,480
associated

263
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,958
with thc so it's true to say that it is

264
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,480
not intoxicating or doesn't produce a

265
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:20,000
high the way that thc does and again

266
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,240
early on that led to less interest now i

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,159
think it leads to more interest because

268
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
of all the benefits it can have

269
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,120
therapeutically

270
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,479
without the possible downside of

271
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,959
intoxication because

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,320
being high as you know is considered a

273
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:39,119
side effect according to the fda

274
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,000
but to answer your question it does work

275
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,440
on

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,759
adrenal receptors on alpha-2 adrenal

277
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,720
receptors and this may have something to

278
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:52,240
do with its effects on pain

279
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,240
um additionally it's an antagonist that

280
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,120
what's called the trip m8 receptor

281
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,120
which

282
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,799
makes it a good candidate for a number

283
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,399
of things

284
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,719
particularly

285
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,078
treatment of prostate cancer

286
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,278
but also overactive bladder

287
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,479
and a variety of other things

288
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,958
and then there are lots of other

289
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,759
activities where all of the um

290
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,359
all of it hasn't been worked out

291
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,958
you know again

292
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,240
its activity at cb1 and cb2 is much much

293
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,559
less

294
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,120
than thc

295
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:34,719
but uh beyond that um and all these

296
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,240
mechanisms aren't uh clear yet but um

297
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,600
back in 2008 giovanni abendino and his

298
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,959
colleagues discovered that cbg is very

299
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,200
powerful as an antibiotic against

300
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:48,439
gram-positive bacteria and that includes

301
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,560
mrsa

302
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,760
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus

303
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,159
aureus

304
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,399
which is associated with

305
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:58,639
hospital-acquired infections and

306
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,360
some years ago was responsible for a lot

307
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
of deaths

308
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
so

309
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,320
so

310
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,319
as far as the

311
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
excuse me

312
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,240
as far as the fact that we haven't

313
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,360
really had consistent access to cbg

314
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,000
until we've developed these more um

315
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,000
cbg dominant plans most folks that i

316
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,200
talk to kind of generally have the

317
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,600
belief that land races had wide-ranging

318
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,480
varieties of cannabinoids until they

319
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,360
became heavily bred for the thc market

320
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,720
and it is that breeding for thc that you

321
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,120
mentioned that bred the cbg out because

322
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,480
it was taking up space in the resin

323
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,639
gland that could be holding thc instead

324
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,480
um have you seen much evidence either

325
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,120
through your research or through your

326
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,600
work with breeders best that there were

327
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,959
cbg dominant land races prior to

328
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,759
us starting to breed it free thc heavily

329
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,159
uh great question i i don't know that we

330
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,078
know that um

331
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,679
what i can say

332
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:10,239
is that where people have been

333
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,679
growing with regenerative agriculture

334
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
real soil

335
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,838
uh

336
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,240
active mycorrhizae

337
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,760
natural bacteria in the soil they're

338
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,200
seeing a great greater diversity

339
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:28,000
of cannabinoid production including cbg

340
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,160
so in other words uh chemovars chemical

341
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,078
varieties that previously

342
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,838
were primarily thc or cbd seem to be

343
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,159
expressing

344
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,279
more different cannabinoids including

345
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,719
cbg when they're grown in this fashion

346
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,639
so

347
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,079
the premise of your question is a real

348
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,159
possibility

349
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:52,399
part of the problem is we don't know uh

350
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,439
it didn't have great analytical

351
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,759
capabilities going back uh to the early

352
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,880
70s when there were more land races

353
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,360
available and as i'm sure you're aware

354
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:05,120
a lot of those have been supplanted by

355
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,199
seeds from california and the

356
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,759
netherlands and so

357
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,838
it's getting harder to find some of the

358
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,838
old land races

359
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,360
but that's a great topic for future

360
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,160
research uh something i'd like to be

361
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,399
able to answer better in the future yeah

362
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,198
it is disappointing that so many of

363
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,639
those original land race populations

364
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,919
have um

365
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,759
um i don't know been infected by worked

366
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:36,078
over lines from from the west um

367
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,360
i do i do hope that people put more

368
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,519
effort into

369
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,278
saving those land races and as a side

370
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,360
note i find that very interesting too

371
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,519
that that you're finding the expression

372
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,879
of cvg and the other various

373
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,600
cannabinoids

374
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,278
is more prevalent in living soil and you

375
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
know from the other episodes we've done

376
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,759
it that would make sense too right if if

377
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,399
the if the

378
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,958
the plant has got a wider relationship

379
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,519
with the soil and the plant is

380
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,719
sharing exudates with the

381
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,759
microbe life in the rhizosphere allowing

382
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,199
a wider variety of life thus feeding the

383
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,399
plant from below

384
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,799
all those

385
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,120
you know delightful excretions in the

386
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,838
living soil it would make sense that

387
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,560
that the plant has got more raw material

388
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,880
to express itself more more wildly which

389
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,599
is you know why why plants that are

390
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,838
grown in soil have got a wider terpene

391
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,680
profile than than than otherwise that's

392
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,199
that's really interesting

393
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,519
so that it would make sense that if

394
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,639
folks who are growing intentionally for

395
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,480
cbg would want to strongly consider

396
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,519
soil all right that's interesting thank

397
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
you for that

398
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,799
um

399
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,839
so um cbg is often called a novel or

400
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,879
minor cannabinoid and in most cases that

401
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,560
seems to be synonymous with not studied

402
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:59,039
much right do those words novel or minor

403
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,559
cannabinoid have any relevance in

404
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:04,719
science

405
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:07,119
well novel is a misnomer uh minor really

406
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,040
refers to the fact that we usually don't

407
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,198
see a lot of it and again that's a

408
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,679
situation we'd like to change

409
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,479
i really think that cbg is the next big

410
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,719
thing

411
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,519
on and maybe in the future we're not

412
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,440
referring to it as a minor cannabinoid

413
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,679
um right so so

414
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,240
so there's a case to be made that really

415
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,159
the words novel and minor are or more of

416
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,079
a layman's terms and

417
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,958
and not actually all that legit all

418
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,679
right novel to me just means uh you know

419
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,758
i hadn't heard of that one so much yet

420
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,679
but again a situation that we need to

421
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,639
change yeah exactly

422
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,120
um

423
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,480
so i was surprised to read in your paper

424
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,879
that cbg actually often occurs or or

425
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,519
maybe not often but occurs elsewhere in

426
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,519
nature other than in cannabis would you

427
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,159
please teach us a bit about that

428
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:02,000
yeah not widely um clear back in 1979

429
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,798
there was an article that was published

430
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,119
in german

431
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,879
from a german group and they were

432
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,279
looking at uh

433
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,559
so-called south african daisy

434
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,078
helichrysum and braculigerum

435
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:20,318
and they found small amounts of both

436
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:22,000
cannabidiolic acid and cannabidirol in

437
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,240
the plant and it was mainly an

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
analytical article

439
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,279
but when you really dig it gets

440
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,839
interesting

441
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:33,918
because this plant and related

442
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,439
species in the genus

443
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,919
are were

444
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,798
sometimes smoked

445
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,799
by indigenous people in south africa

446
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,440
it's not a lot of detail about the

447
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,519
effects but presumably there was some

448
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,880
psychoactive effect and

449
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,119
you know uh

450
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,400
europeans would often look at this and

451
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,959
and claim that these things were smoked

452
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,679
as a tobacco substitute in other words

453
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,840
when people didn't have tobacco to smoke

454
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,200
they'd smoke these other things but i i

455
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,319
think that that's uh culturally myopic

456
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
let's say

457
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,879
um

458
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,880
i think that

459
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,000
my suspicion is that it had an

460
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,039
anti-anxiety effect on that's why it was

461
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,279
being smoked and we've got some

462
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,400
evidence for that now

463
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,759
but the amounts were small um

464
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,559
this was an article that i i knew of and

465
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,879
actually paid to have it translated into

466
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,839
english because i'm not a german reader

467
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,240
um

468
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,879
but again i didn't provide a lot of

469
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,480
detail about the uses

470
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,200
subsequently my colleague mark lewis

471
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,919
looked at some plants that we germinated

472
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,720
it was very hard to get seeds

473
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,360
but he really found only tiny amounts

474
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,360
and it's unlikely without a tremendous

475
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,558
amount of selective breeding that you

476
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,359
could get

477
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,240
significant concentrations

478
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,159
of these molecules from that species it

479
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,519
makes a lot more sense

480
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,320
to selectively breed cannabis where

481
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,879
we can do a lot better these days in

482
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,960
canada production

483
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,919
so in the second set we're going to talk

484
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,360
more about um you know what people are

485
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,880
reporting in the modern day

486
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:28,319
as human users of cannabis but before

487
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,760
your survey the largest survey of users

488
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,480
that has occurred

489
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,679
looking backwards we were looking at

490
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,880
animal studies primarily and there were

491
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,720
some suspicions of what we were going to

492
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,400
find uh the positive uses of it are

493
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,079
so would you would you do a review of uh

494
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
of what we

495
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,639
what i guess what we were suspecting

496
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
when we headed towards

497
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,120
studying human use because of what we've

498
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
learned from the animal studies

499
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,119
yeah again

500
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,038
so the early studies they just didn't

501
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:08,000
see a lot of overt behavioral changes

502
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,480
but then there was some work showing uh

503
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,400
benefit on pain reduction

504
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,880
uh there were studies that showed

505
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,640
decreasing of the intraocular pressure

506
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,760
much as thc can do

507
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,280
there were effects to reduce reddening

508
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,960
uh that were associated with

509
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,240
inflammation

510
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,120
um

511
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,480
uh

512
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,798
more interesting uh were some cytotoxic

513
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,960
effects in other words effects against

514
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,158
cancer

515
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,840
and

516
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,440
that was true in what's called

517
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:44,558
epithelioid carcinoma and then again

518
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,120
in prostate cancer

519
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:50,079
and breast cancer there was also a

520
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,558
prominent response

521
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,439
there was some rodent work done showing

522
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:58,798
an antidepressant effect

523
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,279
there was a reduction of cells called

524
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,558
keratinocytes

525
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,519
that are

526
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:10,240
present excessively in psoriasis so that

527
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:14,480
indicated a possible use there

528
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,120
and let's see what else um

529
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,759
oh an interesting one is um

530
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,839
cbg also works on another receptor a

531
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,759
nuclear receptor that affects gene

532
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,079
transcription called p part gamma

533
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,158
and uh in experiments that were done a

534
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,158
couple of years ago they were shown to

535
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
be a neuroprotective effect and

536
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,640
inflammation

537
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,120
um

538
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,840
and also effects on another um

539
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:45,599
agent called tumor necrosis factor alpha

540
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:48,639
that's involved in autoimmune disorders

541
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,558
so it opens up a lot of possibilities uh

542
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,919
finally there was a recent study just

543
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,558
this year

544
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,360
in gluoblastoma multiforme

545
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,440
um

546
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,918
showing uh

547
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,679
that basically cannabidire could kill

548
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,720
that kind of cell

549
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,679
um

550
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,240
so

551
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,480
again very promising particularly since

552
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,519
without giving anything away i can say

553
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,640
that cannabidiol is a very non-toxic

554
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,879
substance

555
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,120
likely we could give large amounts of it

556
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,679
and to be able to treat

557
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:23,279
cancer successfully without introducing

558
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,720
a lot of other toxicities in other words

559
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,399
side effects

560
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
it's going to be a real boon in the

561
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
future

562
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,879
because

563
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,599
currently available chemotherapy agents

564
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,679
are generally toxic in other words

565
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,359
you hope that you kill a cancer before

566
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,798
you kill too many of the patient's

567
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:43,279
normal cells and this is why uh standard

568
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:48,319
chemotherapy is associated with loss of

569
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:50,558
hair follicles and sloughing the gut and

570
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,879
cannabinoid and other cannabinoids

571
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:56,399
pretend to be

572
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,360
much safer as chemotherapeutic agents uh

573
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,159
so that part's very exciting i'm curious

574
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,719
what you mean using the the

575
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,000
the term that's relative uh you can give

576
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,440
much more cbg right um

577
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,919
for for many folks a a you know a

578
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,240
regular dose is going to be you know

579
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
somewhere between probably 10 and 20

580
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,759
milligrams maybe down to five but

581
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,279
probably 10 to 20.

582
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,720
so when you say

583
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,119
much more

584
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,000
what are you actually saying milligrams

585
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,558
wise

586
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,119
well you know with some of the

587
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,359
cannabinoids it may be necessary to have

588
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,839
hundreds of milligrams a day

589
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,879
um so far at least and i don't want

590
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:41,278
anyone pressing their luck but we've got

591
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,640
so little indication of toxicity from

592
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:46,558
the information we have it's very likely

593
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,400
that those kind of high doses could be

594
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,558
given without

595
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,798
the kinds of drawbacks that we find with

596
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,599
huge doses of thc

597
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,319
uh where certainly people can attain

598
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,399
them

599
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:02,000
but often they have to do it by

600
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,960
titrating upwards over a period of time

601
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,599
as much as two weeks um

602
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
so that that remains to be seen but from

603
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,839
what we know so far

604
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,600
uh my strong suspicion is that high

605
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:19,359
doses of cbg will be tolerable to people

606
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:22,158
um that might need uh higher doses to

607
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,439
treat uh cancer primarily

608
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,480
yeah i've worked with patients that are

609
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,600
taking as much as 250 a day

610
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,038
and um they certainly don't seem to have

611
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,599
any uh negative side effects uh unless

612
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,798
uh not having any anxiety is a side

613
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,719
effect

614
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,599
but um

615
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,960
so this last question before we go to

616
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:47,199
the break um it's a little personal but

617
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,798
i i think that it's called for um

618
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,919
regarding what you've just said about

619
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:54,000
the history of this as as a research

620
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,640
scientist who also

621
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,960
has worked in um you know a general

622
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,720
practice so that you are used to

623
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,759
interacting with real humans who are

624
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,558
really suffering and you're not just

625
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:09,278
um only in the lab where people are

626
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,480
sometimes less connected to the patient

627
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,798
um

628
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,919
how do you feel about the frustration of

629
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,278
having your hands tied for so long and

630
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,200
being able to

631
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,839
research something that you just stated

632
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,000
we've had really good ideas that is

633
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,158
going to help people for so long but no

634
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,480
one's really had the opportunity to

635
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,960
touch it and now

636
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,880
having that opportunity increasing i

637
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,759
mean i as someone who's a lifelong

638
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,440
researcher for you it must be somehow

639
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,200
like a frustrating opportunity

640
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,840
well i think frustration is my middle

641
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,080
name where cannabis comes

642
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:50,720
comes in because you know this has been

643
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:53,678
my life for 25 years um but frankly the

644
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,360
situation with prohibition on cannabis

645
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,038
gerald

646
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,678
is outrageous

647
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,440
it's scandalous and scientifically

648
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,240
untenable

649
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,400
this is not a drug of abuse

650
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,558
i'm certain that when drug abuse

651
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,960
liability studies are done they're just

652
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,119
not going to find a signal here

653
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,679
i could be that it's one of the

654
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,519
solutions to addiction but it won't be a

655
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,320
cause of addiction

656
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,879
um

657
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,960
so it's guilt by association it happens

658
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,640
to come from a plant that also happens

659
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,480
to make thc

660
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,840
uh which similarly shouldn't be

661
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,038
prohibited um so it is an outrageous

662
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,558
situation and the longer it goes on

663
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,879
the greater the

664
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,119
tragedy will be compounded

665
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,520
are you seeing that the ability to do

666
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,839
this kind of research has been eased i

667
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,119
mean you've told me just in passing

668
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,639
you've told me in passing that even

669
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,399
doing this survey is hard and you're

670
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,840
just asking questions what what is the

671
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,038
state of play as far as doing cbg

672
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,798
studies uh

673
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:55,919
well uh

674
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:57,278
you know

675
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,240
technically

676
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,400
it is cbg is a schedule one forbidden

677
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,400
substance and people could be arrested

678
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,000
for it under federal law

679
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,120
that has not changed um irrespective of

680
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,038
the fact that it's legal in many states

681
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,119
um

682
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,640
it would be possible for people to be

683
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,239
prosecuted just for having this stuff

684
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,399
so that hasn't changed and the

685
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,440
roadblocks to research

686
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,359
remain

687
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,480
essentially

688
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,959
no

689
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,159
no different substantially from what i

690
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,200
experienced back in the 90s

691
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,640
jeez so well that's the frustrating

692
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,960
opportunity right

693
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,200
yeah well another reason i've worked for

25 years

696
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,359
yeah that makes sense well i'm excited

697
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,640
to hear what the what the survey shows

for years organic cultivators have been

761
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,599
looking for a replacement for using peat

762
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,439
moss peat moss has long been the go-to

763
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,519
soil amendment for water retention and

764
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,679
container growing but organic growers

765
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,759
know that peat moss is an unsustainable

766
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,440
resource and the mining of peat bogs

767
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,839
destroys habitat and releases

768
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,679
sequestered carbon but peat moss works

769
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,439
so well that many have continued to use

770
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,600
it but now there's finally a

771
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,600
revolutionary replacement for peat moss

772
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,119
that shares the same benefits while also

773
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,158
being sustainable

774
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,158
pit moss sounds an axe like peat moss

775
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,159
but instead of being mined from fragile

776
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,960
ecosystems it actually is made from

777
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,880
upcycled organic paper and tree bark pit

778
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,720
moss is excellent at retaining water in

779
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,559
your substrate and creating air pockets

780
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,440
and tiny living environments for

781
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:44,000
microbes pit moss instantly increases

783
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,919
conservation too

carefully and locally sourced pit moss

785
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,640
is the result of decades-long research

786
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:55,038
into the use of recycled paper fibers

787
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,679
pittmoss has the fluffy nature of peat

788
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,319
moss and handles exactly the same and

789
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,159
like peat moss pit moss is inert so it

790
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,000
won't change your ph

802
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,398
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

803
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,319
growing is so valued by farmers is

804
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,398
because the mycelium networks in the

805
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,278
soil remain established from year to

806
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,038
year

807
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,200
and we know these fungal networks are

808
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,519
essential because they are the nutrient

809
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,240
super highways that extend far and wide

810
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,240
in the substrate to feed your plants

811
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,720
the trouble with growing in new living

812
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,120
soils or blended cocoa substrates is

813
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,839
that it takes most of the plant's life

814
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:01,439
just to create these mycelium highways

dinomyco-endomicrite fungi inoculant

eating a wider array of nutrients faster

818

and our guest this week is cannabis

857
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,440
researcher and neurologist dr ethan

858
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,640
russo so during this set we're going to

859
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,640
focus specifically on this survey

860
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,320
with a title that is

861
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,200
a mouthful so here it is the title of

862
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,678
the of the paper is survey of patients

863
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,240
employing cannabid girl predominant

864
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,559
cannabis preparations perceived medical

865
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,679
effects adverse effects and withdrawal

866
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:58,480
symptoms

867
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,559
so

868
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,558
uh you pretty much know what the agenda

869
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,918
is here in the second set

870
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,839
so um

871
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,079
so ethan i you've got um a handful of

872
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,598
co-authors on this study and you know

873
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,599
that everyone put in hard work so i'd

874
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
like us to take the opportunity to to

875
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,879
give them a nod if you would

876
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,320
sure well this was a real uh labor of

877
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:24,639
love on involved three universities as

878
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,280
well as credo science

879
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,399
it was my idea to do this

880
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,560
but i immediately wanted to enlist

881
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,638
the help of carrie cutler

882
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,358
on the department of psychology at

883
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,000
washington state university

884
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,519
who was fantastic in putting this

885
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,480
together

886
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,280
and really implementing the survey

887
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,358
which

888
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,839
we decided what to ask jointly but a lot

889
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,918
of that work was also informed uh by

890
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,320
michelle sexton at the university of

891
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,960
california san francisco

892
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,838
we also enlisted the aid of another

893
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,639
great researcher ziva cooper at ucla

894
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,358
and

895
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,960
grad student amanda steuber

896
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,239
who works with

897
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,720
kerry

898
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:16,159
was involved as well as my business

899
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,919
partner nisha whiteley of credo science

900
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:22,078
so i had the

901
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,039
great fortune to be involved with five

902
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,839
wonderful women in doing this study and

903
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,838
it all went very smoothly

904
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,559
from our

905
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:33,519
standpoint

906
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,838
um who funded this study

907
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,679
uh well

908
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,838
basically uh

909
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:43,598
essentially kerry and

910
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:46,320
the rest volunteered their time

911
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,440
you know uh same with us at credo

912
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,240
science uh we offered two gift cards as

913
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,280
an incentive to participation that cost

914
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:57,519
me personally a hundred bucks

915
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,280
the the the people who were recruited

916
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,719
you paid for the for the raffle

917
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,280
everybody was in

918
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,519
oh yes that's funny i assumed that since

919
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,599
this was being done in cooperation with

920
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,440
universities that that the way it always

921
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,800
happens is that the university foots the

922
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,800
bill for everything but i guess that's

923
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,599
an incorrect understanding on my part

924
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,920
well

925
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,359
it generally would be um

926
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,440
you know clearly

927
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,920
kerry and other people work through

928
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,519
grants but sometimes the grants offer

929
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,039
latitude and in how you spend your time

930
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,440
but

931
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,679
you know this was not uh funded by the

932
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,800
national institutes of health uh

933
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,639
directly or anything like that

934
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,960
all right well then uh let's move right

935
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,598
into the survey um um i'm just gonna

936
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,358
kind of like hand you the mic because um

937
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,760
so that you can go go through your notes

938
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,759
would you explain for us how the survey

939
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,920
was set up and operated

940
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,920
sure well first um the study was

941
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,240
exempted uh from what's called the

942
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,800
institutional review board they looked

943
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:00,319
at it and decided that we weren't going

944
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,320
to do anything that would

945
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,839
interfere with the anonymity of

946
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:10,159
participants or expose them to the legal

947
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,400
problems so we had

948
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,759
free reign to

949
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,599
take

950
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,839
take people through this

951
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,480
and we recruited people online with

952
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,639
listserv social media and some personal

953
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,519
contacts and

954
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,920
had

955
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:29,119
some help there

956
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,200
a survey was placed online

957
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,480
and there were certain things we wanted

958
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,399
to see

959
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,000
to avoid issues

960
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:41,039
we made it adults only age 21 or up

961
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,960
they had to be an american resident and

962
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,759
they had to and this was the important

963
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,039
part

964
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,760
they had to be using uh a cannabidiol

965
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,519
predominant product meaning at least 50

966
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,160
percent cbg

967
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,280
uh in the past six months

968
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,598
and then

969
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,960
we asked a bunch of questions and

970
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,359
uh analyzed those statistically

971
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,240
in terms of the demographics uh

972
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:10,880
166 people started but

973
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:12,799
127 completed and that's not unusual

974
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,480
people get bored or decide they don't

975
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,480
want to do it for some reason

976
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:25,838
it was about 34 males and 40 females uh

977
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,320
predominantly caucasian some diversity

978
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:31,279
there was a range of income in education

979
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,559
but unlike some surveys of medical use

980
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,000
of cannabis

981
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,320
where there are a lot of people who are

982
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,480
disabled or unemployed the majority of

983
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,800
the people who took part

984
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,199
were working

985
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,119
the first thing we examined was the use

986
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,399
patterns for the cannabis gerald

987
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,838
predominant

988
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,800
products

989
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:53,119
people had averaged taking these for a

990
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,280
little bit over nine months so it wasn't

991
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,760
oh you know i tried it once

992
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,200
and uh this is what happened we we

993
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,280
thought we had a better uh foundation of

994
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,759
information

995
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,839
when people were using flour they

996
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,560
averaged about three and a half grams of

997
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:11,599
cbg per week

998
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,838
and

999
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,720
for people using concentrates it was

1000
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:18,960
about a gram of cbg concentrates per

1001
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,039
week

1002
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,039
then we wanted to know

1003
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,199
why people took it in other words what

1004
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,559
conditions were they

1005
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,960
they treating

1006
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,639
and actually they were probably boy

1007
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,639
didn't count um

1008
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,639
there must have been 40 or 50 things

1009
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,159
that were mentioned and some people had

1010
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:39,598
more than one

1011
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:42,159
but the point being that over half 51.2

1012
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,680
percent were using cbg for medical

1013
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:47,759
purposes

1014
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:52,799
only 6.3 percent characterized the use

1015
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,960
as recreational and about 36.2 percent

1016
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,160
uh called it both

1017
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,720
on so this is a common situation

1018
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:04,318
certainly one could argue that all use

1019
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:06,959
has a medical basis

1020
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:09,039
but that's how people judge this

1021
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,960
themselves

1022
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,079
the most common conditions that were

1023
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,920
cited uh by the population involved uh

1024
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:21,359
were anxiety 51.2

1025
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,720
chronic pain which was 40.9

1026
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,960
uh depression 33.1 percent

1027
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,559
and insomnia difficulty sleeping and

1028
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,639
30.7

1029
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,880
and again that's this is all based on

1030
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,838
127 people who completed the survey and

1031
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,318
again

1032
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,239
we're using cannabidiol predominant

1033
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,039
products

1034
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:45,519
the next thing we wanted to examine was

1035
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,519
how did they compare cannabidirol with

1036
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,800
conventional medicines that might be

1037
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,880
used to treat the same conditions

1038
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,800
well first of all

1039
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,400
they seem to think that this worked

1040
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,560
pretty well

1041
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,318
majority of the conditions people said

1042
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,920
that they were much or very much

1043
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:06,400
improved as compared to prior to taking

1044
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,280
canape gerald

1045
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,160
the highest efficacy was

1046
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,800
associated with endometriosis

1047
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,118
on gynecological condition

1048
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,200
on

1049
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:22,480
66.7 percent

1050
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,960
cited that as as being helpful then uh

1051
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,400
one i didn't necessarily expect

1052
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,358
inflammatory bowel disease 75

1053
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,880
uh

1054
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:34,920
in irritable bowel syndrome 82.4

1055
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,200
so clearly people with

1056
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,519
gastrointestinal issues

1057
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,480
found this quite helpful

1058
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,239
now what's really interesting to me was

1059
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,358
not a single person thought that

1060
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:50,000
conventional medicine was superior

1061
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,440
to cbg for these various countries not a

1062
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,039
single person

1063
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,920
that's extreme

1064
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,000
yeah it really makes you wonder and

1065
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,318
i'm sure that some people probably think

1066
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,719
oh you know

1067
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,679
again it's a psychoactive effect they're

1068
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,919
high

1069
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,838
but they weren't high um

1070
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,559
so it's not the usual

1071
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:13,039
uh disclaimer that you sometimes

1072
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,799
hear about in relation to thc they're

1073
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:16,880
high and they don't care

1074
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,119
that about their condition

1075
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,280
anymore so that's clearly just not the

1076
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,519
case

1077
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,920
another measure of efficacy of a

1078
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,880
medicine is what does it allow you to

1079
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,519
stop in other words

1080
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,800
were people discontinuing conventional

1081
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,960
medicines

1082
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,480
on there were a significant number of

1083
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,358
people who

1084
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,599
discontinued conventional medicine

1085
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,679
because of the use of cbg

1086
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,559
and this is particularly true for

1087
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:49,358
antidepressant meds

1088
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,119
the non-opioid analgesics so that would

1089
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,799
include things like non-steroidal

1090
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,400
anti-inflammatories

1091
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,640
and also protein pump inhibitors

1092
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,119
so you know they'd be used with

1093
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,598
by people who had ulcers or that kind of

1094
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,119
problem so again we've got the gut

1095
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,119
um seemingly a lot of affinity there for

1096
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,800
that kind of problem

1097
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,680
um so

1098
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,039
we're

1099
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,960
again

1100
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,119
one of the main reasons we did this is

1101
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,119
finding out what it's good for

1102
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,400
and frankly

1103
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,760
you know we

1104
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:27,838
we wanted to establish this because

1105
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,440
i expect that cbg on cbg predominant

1106
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,920
products eventually you're going to be

1107
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,358
going into clinical trials and we have

1108
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,599
to establish a pattern on number one of

1109
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,519
what's it good for and number two

1110
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,000
is it safe and

1111
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:45,280
certainly that was one of the primary

1112
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
reasons we wanted to do this this survey

1113
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,920
to lay a foundation for future

1114
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
more in-depth randomized controlled

1115
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,039
trials that's an interesting idea

1116
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,519
especially with how you described the

1117
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,519
the legal environment for trying to do

1118
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,838
this sort of research that if i

1119
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,960
understand you correctly you kind of had

1120
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:08,239
to do this study first

1121
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,599
so that you can now go back to the well

1122
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:14,399
and do a more complex deeper study

1123
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,280
because without this study

1124
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,358
um

1125
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,160
you would not be able to get a heavier

1126
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:23,279
duty study even approved

1127
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,920
yeah certainly true so uh

1128
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,480
i can relate a story um believe it or

1129
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,838
not it was not that many years ago uh

1130
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,838
that my my colleague donald abrams

1131
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:38,400
wanted to do a study looking at

1132
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:42,559
inhaled cannabidiol cbd

1133
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,000
and the first reaction from the fda was

1134
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,119
well we don't

1135
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,239
have a record of uh human use in this

1136
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,358
fashion

1137
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:54,479
uh which really wasn't true cbd had been

1138
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:58,239
extensively investigated as part of

1139
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,199
of sativex nepiximals in clinical trials

1140
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:03,759
on we we knew all we needed to know

1141
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,639
about its safety for humans

1142
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,040
but basically he had to put together

1143
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,759
information showing that cbd was

1144
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:14,639
extensively available in california and

1145
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,440
elsewhere and that hundreds of thousands

1146
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,598
of people were using it with no

1147
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,519
major problems and then he was able to

1148
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,760
proceed with the research

1149
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,000
well you know you have to look at these

1150
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,960
things and wonder what's going to happen

1151
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,318
the next round with the next new

1152
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,119
quote-unquote

1153
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,358
cannabinoid and i really anticipated

1154
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,920
that there would be pushback about

1155
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,799
proposed cbg studies

1156
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,480
um

1157
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,400
normally uh say uh drugs really new a

1158
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,480
new chemical entity something you

1159
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,119
synthesize in the lab

1160
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,240
the normal procedure is to test it in

1161
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:55,200
animals and do advanced toxicology

1162
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,679
studies where huge amounts are given to

1163
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,799
rats and or dogs

1164
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:00,719
and then

1165
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,119
if there are no major problems you get

1166
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:06,239
to give it to people well this is

1167
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,640
cannabis again the amounts of cbg in the

1168
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:11,759
past were probably low but

1169
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,199
again we wanted to establish a pattern

1170
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,040
of use

1171
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:19,199
by humans uh without apparent problems

1172
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,480
so that we hopefully will not face the

1173
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:24,960
same kind of resistance

1174
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,400
did you have a difficulty

1175
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,480
finding you know the the 166 people who

1176
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,599
started but then like the 127 that

1177
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,159
finished

1178
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,280
um you know as somebody who works

1179
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,000
closely with cbg i know that finding you

1180
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,359
know

1181
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,960
cvg dominant products or flour that are

1182
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:47,519
51 or more cbg that's very rare you know

1183
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,639
that's that's not a common uh thing was

1184
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,559
was it

1185
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,799
what did you find as far as like being

1186
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,039
able to recruit people who had access to

1187
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,359
that was was that a challenge

1188
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,679
uh well you know most of the people came

1189
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,440
from the northwest this has really uh

1190
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:04,239
been the year in the world where there's

1191
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,800
been the most intensive uh cultivation

1192
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,318
of cbg predominant varieties and the

1193
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,519
greatest interest

1194
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:13,679
in its therapeutic use um it didn't take

1195
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,358
us forever to do this i think it was

1196
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:18,559
just a few months

1197
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,679
um so i was quite gratified with that

1198
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:21,358
and

1199
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,639
the other thing was we had very good

1200
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,480
contacts

1201
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,759
on trying to do this

1202
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,920
you know

1203
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,960
among others we sent this to our

1204
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,720
colleagues that see the greatest number

1205
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,318
of patients

1206
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:39,358
for cannabis recommendations and a lot

1207
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,800
of them are accessing cbg predominant

1208
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,838
products and

1209
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,359
um it it came together nicely

1210
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:48,239
it's interesting that you mentioned that

1211
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,880
it's um prevalent most in the pacific

1212
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,639
northwest uh or for the interest it was

1213
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,400
was there anything that came up in the

1214
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,239
research that give you anything to

1215
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,800
attribute that for i mean

1216
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:00,799
my my only bet would be because the the

1217
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,559
crawford brothers are in oregon and

1218
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,720
that's my best bet well they've been the

1219
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,680
prime movers for sure but uh there are

1220
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:11,519
other braiders that have independently

1221
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,919
bred cbg predominant varieties and

1222
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,039
interest is increased

1223
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,760
but yeah we in the northwest are really

1224
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,519
at the center of uh interest in this

1225
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,440
compound

1226
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,440
interesting um

1227
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,400
so i asked this question not as an

1228
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,039
indictment simply as a neutral question

1229
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,920
but um how should we weigh the

1230
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,440
scientific validity of self-reporting in

1231
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,240
this case right

1232
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,119
i don't know a lot about um conducting

1233
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:43,358
scientific research but self-reporting

1234
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,480
sounds like something that should be at

1235
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:49,199
least considered for for accuracy

1236
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,000
but i know it counts as actual science

1237
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:54,159
so so how can we think about that well

1238
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,400
uh you know in the hierarchy of medical

1239
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,598
proof a survey doesn't get a lot of

1240
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,838
credence

1241
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:04,240
however in this instance we had good

1242
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:07,519
numbers we had specificity with

1243
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:09,919
again not the idea that the one percent

1244
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,759
cbg was present these were cbg

1245
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,079
predominant uh

1246
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,559
products being used

1247
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,839
additionally we saw consistency in the

1248
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,880
results

1249
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:19,838
um

1250
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,920
and

1251
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,440
you know it would be different if this

1252
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,920
were something that

1253
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,039
people took because they liked it in

1254
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,519
other words

1255
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,358
where people could claim that well you

1256
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:35,920
know people use regular cannabis because

1257
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:38,000
they like thc and like being high that

1258
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,800
just wasn't the case here

1259
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,760
um

1260
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,800
also we had consistency in the side

1261
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,040
effects

1262
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,480
you know we've talked about the good we

1263
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,440
need to include

1264
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,318
the bad such as it was but as it turned

1265
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,480
out

1266
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,558
there wasn't a lot to say

1267
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,119
uh 44

1268
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,839
of people in the survey reported no

1269
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,318
adverse events in other words no

1270
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:04,558
significant side effects

1271
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,599
most common were things that might have

1272
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,000
been

1273
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,880
due to

1274
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,280
thc that was in some of the preparations

1275
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,920
so dry mouth sleepiness

1276
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,519
increased appetite and dry eyes all of

1277
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,280
which

1278
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:23,119
could have been thc induced

1279
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,760
interestingly although we were asking

1280
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,559
about adverse events 10 percent reported

1281
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,000
of

1282
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,640
other side benefits

1283
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,760
but when we look at

1284
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,799
the list

1285
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,319
it's not an extensive list

1286
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,640
people were not

1287
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:41,679
reporting anything

1288
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,000
really

1289
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:46,879
dangerous like paranoia or

1290
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,119
hallucinations

1291
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,039
and we also wanted to ask about

1292
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,640
withdrawal say you've been taking this

1293
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,358
for a while what happened when you

1294
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:57,039
stopped but

1295
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:59,039
84.3 percent reported no withdrawal

1296
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,400
symptoms of any kind

1297
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,838
um

1298
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,720
there were

1299
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:07,199
very very few uh who reported sleep

1300
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:10,000
difficulties when they quit

1301
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,759
as compared to non-cbd

1302
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,239
predominant cannabis in other words

1303
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,680
garden variety cannabis uh there were

1304
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,759
very s

1305
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,919
marked statistically significant

1306
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,400
differences in other words

1307
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,400
when people stopped they had many fewer

1308
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,400
issues if any

1309
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,440
as compared to other types of cannabis

1310
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,720
so

1311
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,960
it's clear again this isn't addictive

1312
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,799
it's not getting people high

1313
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,400
it's not producing significant

1314
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,720
withdrawal

1315
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,519
i have got a quick question about the

1316
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:46,879
definition of withdrawal um

1317
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:50,639
you know i i'm a i'm a regular cbg uh

1318
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,119
user and it does a wonderful job

1319
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:55,598
decreasing my anxiety and softening my

1320
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,160
adhd

1321
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:01,440
however when i haven't had it for a few

1322
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:05,199
days some of the sharper edges of those

1323
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,358
aspects of me come out and and and so

1324
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:10,399
it's it's not that i've with that i'm

1325
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:13,119
having withdrawal symptoms from

1326
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,559
the the supplement it's because without

1327
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,000
the supplement

1328
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,400
um

1329
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,480
my brain's a lot clankier right

1330
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,400
what's a definitional difference between

1331
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:27,280
withdrawal and just missing the cannabis

1332
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,280
yeah well you've made you've asked the

1333
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,359
exactly right question

1334
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,480
there's a difference between withdrawal

1335
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:37,119
and a recrudescence a reappearance of of

1336
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,440
symptoms that were present before

1337
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,079
so withdrawal would be

1338
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,800
more the idea of something's worse than

1339
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,960
it was before or something that wasn't

1340
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,240
there at all before

1341
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,119
um you know withdrawal uh

1342
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:56,159
and other drugs uh

1343
00:52:53,119 --> 00:53:00,318
you know would also lead to craving

1344
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:02,480
um we we didn't hear about uh craving to

1345
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:05,039
speak of

1346
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,599
or behavior

1347
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:11,119
obsessive behavior

1348
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:13,519
to reacquire the material the things

1349
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,838
that one would associate with

1350
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:20,239
say opioid addiction where people

1351
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:22,799
unfortunately turn to crime to obtain it

1352
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:25,118
nothing like that

1353
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,039
and no pink elephants or things we

1354
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:30,640
associate with alcohol

1355
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:33,599
no dts etc

1356
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:35,199
so um of the people i know you've

1357
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,960
already given us the numbers of the

1358
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,558
people who

1359
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,920
thought that the

1360
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,640
cannabis was more effective for their

1361
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,358
ailment than the pharmaceutical

1362
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:51,118
treatments that they were taking

1363
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:54,078
was there any sense of how many people

1364
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,400
you know they had an opportunity to have

1365
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,079
cbg and they saw it worked and they were

1366
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,880
not interested in the pharmaceutical but

1367
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,640
then they couldn't find more because cbg

1368
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,480
seems to still be spotty right in the

1369
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,558
market yeah

1370
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,838
i'm afraid we just don't have that kind

1371
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:12,240
of information yet

1372
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:13,838
um and again hopefully

1373
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,479
supplies will

1374
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,239
be available in the future and this

1375
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,760
won't be a problem

1376
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,879
um but

1377
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,960
you know again from scientific point of

1378
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:28,160
view we're looking at this as a

1379
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,760
foundation towards much more

1380
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,639
sophisticated

1381
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,119
studies that are going to be

1382
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,039
in the upper reaches of that hierarchy

1383
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,480
of medical proof

1384
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,798
basically

1385
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,838
anything short of a randomized control

1386
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:44,880
trial

1387
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:46,480
with comparative placebo is not given a

1388
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,039
lot of credence

1389
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,880
by physicians or the food and drug

administration

1391
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,318
so that's what we're going to need to

1392
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:58,639
really uh prove if you will

1393
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:00,880
that this is going to be a valuable

1394

00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,400
and guaranteeing complying crops for

1518
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,240
farmers every time

1519
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,599
also these new varieties cannot be

1520
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:29,919
pollinated by your neighbor's

1521
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,680
uncontrolled pollen or a rogue male in

1522
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,240
your own crop either

1523
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:35,279
oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

1524
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:38,000
too

1525
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,798
oregon cbd seeds was founded and funded

1526
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,559
in 2015 by seth and eric maxing out

1527
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:44,880
their personal credit cards without

1528
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,559
outside investment they continue to

1529
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,720
refuse outside investment that would

1530
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:51,440
change their company culture

1531
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:53,279
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

1532
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,838
their research farms for local food

1533
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,000
banks literally tons of food

1534
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,880
they also give away tens of thousands of

1535
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,199
pounds of r d flour to patients

1536
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,960
as their company began to succeed seth

1537
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,598
and eric started donating money to the

1538
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,519
cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause 2

1539
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,599
by giving millions of dollars to oregon

1540
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,519
state university in order to establish

1541
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,039
the world's leading cannabis genomics

1542
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,039

1543
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:19,358
and they treat their employees right

1544
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,440
oregon cbd pays for full health and

1547
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:28,879

1549
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,640
seth has been on shaping fire a few

welcome back you are listening to

1565
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,759
shaping fire i am your host shango los

1566
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:11,920
and our guest this week is cannabis

1567
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,040
researcher and neurologist dr ethan

1568
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,960
russo

1569
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,199
so let's take a look forward you know

1570
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,760
during the first set we got a better

1571
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:22,719
understanding of what cbg is and a bit

1572
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,559
about how it is functioning in the human

1573
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,838
and then during the second set you know

1574
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:31,839
we essentially talked to like 127 people

1575
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:33,838
to find out how cbg is helping them live

1576
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,920
better lives and get off of their

1577
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:37,599
pharmaceuticals with uh you know

1578
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,960
increased side effects so that's all

1579
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,519
great

1580
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,400
and we've already also talked about how

1581
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,119
the

1582
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,039
environment for research for cbg is

1583
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,838
opening but there's still all these

1584
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:53,920
hoops you've got to go through

1585
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:56,639
i'm curious right now uh what show what

1586
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,559
what areas are showing promise looking

1587
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,798
forward um

1588
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,119
because you know i know there are there

1589
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:05,759
are you know you know college and

1590
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,880
graduate students and citizen scientists

1591
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,119
and others

1592
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:12,798
who are constantly looking for the

1593
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,640
promise in cannabinoids and and perhaps

1594
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,960
we can either motivate them or direct

1595
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:18,558
them in ways that are are most likely to

1596
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,920
bear fruit so

1597
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:25,039
the survey measured the prior use of the

1598
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:28,400
participants and their continued need

1599
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:30,000
for 13 different classes of medications

1600
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,079
that they

1601
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,599
appeared to be linked with cvg and you

1602
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,960
talked about that a little bit already

1603
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,559
saying that you know there are a lot of

1604
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:41,838
people who um a uh

1605
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,760
preferred it to their pharma and b

1606
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:44,880
because they knew it they believed it

1607
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,920
worked

1608
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,519
what are the classes of these 13

1609
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,798
different medications because it would

1610
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:56,318
seem to point where we should look at

1611
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:58,960
uh for for shorter term success

1612
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:01,440
sure well you know once again that the

1613
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,880
best signal were

1614
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:07,798
for non-opioid pain relievers

1615
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,960
uh with the opioids it wasn't a highly

1616
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:13,440
statistically significant effect

1617
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,079
um so it'd be a little different

1618
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,480
from the claims that we hear associated

1619
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,960
with say thc

1620
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:23,519
predominant cannabis

1621
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,000
but probably i think the most important

1622
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:28,880
one here is antidepressants

1623
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,559
so there was a p-value probability value

1624
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,079
0.02

1625
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,039
anything below

1626
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:38,720
0.05 is considered statistically

1627
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:41,839
significant for medical purposes

1628
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:43,199
so that one's really interesting

1629
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:46,719
but

1630
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,598
i would say that considering the number

1631
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:50,078
of

1632
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,200
the big number of conditions that we saw

1633
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,000
listed

1634
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:55,199
um that there are probably many other

1635
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,639
areas

1636
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:00,239
um that beyond those uh where this would

1637
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,279
be fruitful

1638
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:04,558
um again we can go back to the basic

1639
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,640
science

1640
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:12,400
um and really see where the signals are

1641
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:15,598
um so you know if the question would be

1642
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,680
uh what is going to be promising for

1643
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,318
future indications i think we have the

1644
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:21,919
answers already

1645
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:24,960
so

1646
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,480
as far as like the the

1647
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,480
how many people

1648
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,318
what i'm going to is is market

1649
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,400
attraction right because one of the

1650
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,558
interesting aspects of of the paper is

1651
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,519
that you know towards the end it's all

1652
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,839
you know

1653
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:40,318
there's there's accessibility and it's

1654
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:42,719
potential future and pharmaceuticals but

1655
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:44,798
really the fastest mover right now is

1656
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:46,480
the cannabis market and people's

1657
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:49,199
interests in

1658
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:54,559
in cannabis with you know what we're

1659
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:57,519
calling novel cannabinoids right so um

1660
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,680
as far as the statistics go does this

1661
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:02,400
look like something that is going to be

1662
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:03,919
desired by everybody because on its face

1663
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,440
to me it does

1664
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:10,400
how did it bear out in the numbers

1665
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,960
well again it's hard to say um

1666
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,960
you know when

1667
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,480
a new thing comes along there's always

1668
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,318
somebody that's going to suggest we

1669
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,000
should put it in the water i'm not going

1670
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:21,038
to go that far

1671
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,559
um

1672
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:27,039
however um

1673
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,880
i do see certain areas that are

1674
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,000
preeminent here

1675
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,920
um

1676
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,880
as i'm sure you've

1677
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,440
heard uh from your contacts

1678
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,760
this seems to be a remarkable treatment

1679
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,318
for anxiety

1680
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:46,000
and what really distinguishes it

1681
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:48,558
from other uh drugs is that it does this

1682
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,358
without being overtly sedating

1683
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,880
most anxiety agents are going to be

1684
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,639
quite sedating

1685
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,838
many are addictive

1686
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:58,879
uh clearly cbg is not either of those

1687
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:01,279
things

1688
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,880
on i've also heard people

1689
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,119
say something

1690
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,200
to me that's very profound

1691
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,280
in relation to its use and trending

1692
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:12,318
anxiety and that is

1693
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,680
its ability to allow them to compound

1694
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:15,838
mentalize

1695
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:18,798
what that means is

1696
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:20,960
you know whatever was bothering them

1697
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:24,079
they know it's there but they can put it

1698
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,119
aside and concentrate on the tasks at

1699
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,400
hand

1700
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:30,640
in other words

1701
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:32,400
just not let it pervasively interfere

1702
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:35,598
with their functioning

1703
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:38,240
um to me that's the definition

1704
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:41,519
of a good drug for anxiety

1705
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:43,358
um allowing people to function better

1706
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,519
um i'd like to add a little color to

1707
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:47,199
that as well and i i like the way that

1708
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:48,798
that you put that uh

1709
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:51,279
when i hear about that that same

1710
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:53,358
attribute from patients they talk about

1711
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,319
it being they feel like they've got an

1712
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:59,279
increased capability that their their

1713
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:02,318
their their life struggles or challenges

1714
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,559
or pain have not decreased but somehow

1715
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:08,558
they feel like they're able to handle it

1716
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,359
like they um have the capability to meet

1717
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:13,200
the

1718
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:15,960
the difficulty of of the issue and

1719
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:19,919
and in a way that's them being able to

1720
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:22,000
compartmentalize it so that they can um

1721
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,880
you know they can they can handle it

1722
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,159
more

1723
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:28,640
were there other varieties of anxiety

1724
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,000
that you saw pop up

1725
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,759
gee not

1726
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,760
we we just

1727
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,400
survey could not have that level of

1728
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:38,319
detail i think that would come from

1729
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,720
patient narratives

1730
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,400
um and that's something we'll have to

1731
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:44,399
supplement in the future

1732
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,798
right on that that makes sense for for

1733
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,798
folks that are listening and are curious

1734
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:50,400
the other things that that i'm seeing

1735
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:52,559
just from people taking them and

1736
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,119
certainly not at a scientific level and

1737
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,839
nearly only anecdotal

1738
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,079
we're also seeing a decrease in uh

1739
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:01,358
people ruminating either ruminating

1740
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,200
first thing in the morning of all the

1741
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,038
things that could potentially go wrong

1742
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,919
or ruminating at night of all the things

1743
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,960
that potentially did get wrong and

1744
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,200
re-rethinking things

1745
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,199
and um and for others that that

1746
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:15,598
background anxiety that a lot of people

1747
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,599
have well right there you may have put

1748
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:20,239
your finger on how this has been good

1749
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,960
for sleep because certainly nobody's

1750
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:25,358
gonna get to sleep if they're running

1751
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,319
through the all the bad stuff that

1752
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,480
happened

1753
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:30,719
during the day or all the bad stuff

1754
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:32,798
they're facing tomorrow that's a sleep

1755
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:35,679
killer we're finding that a lot of the

1756
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:37,359
people who are sensitive to thc

1757
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,880
and they don't really want to take it at

1758
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,400
night because i don't understand the

1759
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,119
mechanics behind this but some people

1760
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:46,158
who will take as little as um you know

1761
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:48,238
five or ten milligrams at night they

1762
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:50,399
they describe a

1763
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,158
hangover of sorts and

1764
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:54,000
and they don't they don't care for it

1765
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:56,238
and and we've found that a lot of the

1766
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,920
people who switch over to the cbg since

1767
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:59,919
it doesn't have the thc in the

1768
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,319
preparation at significant numbers if

1769
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,000
you're pulling it from hemp um they're

1770
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,400
still getting to sleep because the

1771
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,560
ruminatings get gone but they're not

1772
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,920
using the thc so

1773
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,359
that's a win

1774
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:15,440
sure yeah so um what are your thoughts

1775
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,039
so so you and i have talked actually

1776
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,919
probably several times on this show

1777
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,679
about

1778
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:23,838
um about your interest in whole plant

1779
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,759
compounds um

1780
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:26,880
as a preference to

1781
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:29,039
um

1782
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,960
using lots of isolates

1783
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,560
and and so

1784
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,520
we know that you're you're you're

1785
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,159
probably top choice would be to have a

1786
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:41,600
plant that is bred and grown

1787
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:44,318
specifically with a particular blend for

1788
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,798
a certain set of ailments and then

1789
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,798
creating a whole plant oil and then and

1790
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:49,679
then giving that to the patient

1791
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:50,640
um

1792
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,119
however

1793
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:56,719
the market has not developed the point

1794
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:59,920
yet that those preparations really exist

1795
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:03,439
um except for you know small pockets um

1796
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:06,239
what are your thoughts on doing with cbg

1797
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:08,238
what many people did you know five years

1798
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:10,879
ago with cbd

1799
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:13,678
where they would make a

1800
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,560
a whole plant oil think of it as like an

1801
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:18,800
rso or a fico or whatever you know

1802
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,600
people say call it in there where they

1803
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,159
live

1804
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:25,120
but a they prepare a whole plant oil and

1805
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:30,719
then they spike it with cbg isolate like

1806
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:32,800
people used to spike cbd into a thc rso

1807
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:35,439
um what are your thoughts on that whole

1808
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,000
range of yeah

1809
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:40,719
uh well you know certainly it's a

1810
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,319
legitimate approach to treating a

1811
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,560
disorder

1812
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:47,599
we know that cbd

1813
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:50,560
also has anti-anxiety properties the

1814
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,159
difference being that the doses required

1815
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:56,480
for cbd

1816
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:59,119
are a lot higher than with cbg

1817
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,158
it remains to be seen but it's a good

1818
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:02,238
bet

1819
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:04,319
that the combination is going to be more

1820
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:06,718
effective and then there'd be other

1821
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,399
components particularly terpenoids that

1822
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:12,119
can contribute here

1823
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:14,319
um so certainly uh the possibilities for

1824
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:15,279
experimentation are great

1825
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,880
um

1826
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:19,840
and

1827
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:21,920
it is a situation fortunately even in

1828
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:25,600
development of a pharmaceutical from

1829
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:29,520
cannabis uh that this kind of blending

1830
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:32,560
is allowed as long as the material is

1831
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,679
all cannabis derived that's a legitimate

1832
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,280
approach

1833
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:40,480
and we know this already because in fact

1834
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:43,439
sativax or nubiximals which is approved

1835
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:46,559
in 30 countries is actually a blend of

1836
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:50,079
two different chemovars a thc

1837
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,400
predominant chemivar and uh cbd

1838
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:55,039
predominant chemoverse so the same kind

1839
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:57,519
of approach could be used

1840
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:59,760
with a cbg

1841
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,840
predominant chemo var in combination

1842
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,159
with something else to give the blend

1843
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,560
that we wish

1844
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:09,198
you know a few states especially the

1845
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,039
ones that are still medical

1846
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:14,000
are having

1847
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:16,560
you know internal policy discussions

1848
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,880
about whether or not

1849
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:22,719
isolate that has been added to

1850
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,920
cannabis products

1851
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,319
should be

1852
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:29,679
labeled as such so the kind of product

1853
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:33,039
that we just talked about a an oil of a

1854
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:36,079
whole plant oil if if it's been spiked

1855
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:36,880
with either cbg or cbd or anything else

1856
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:39,840
that

1857
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:42,159
it should be noted on the package that

1858
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:45,039
there was isolate added to it kind of

1859
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:47,119
like a you know fortified with cbg kind

1860
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:48,479
of thing what are your thoughts does it

1861
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,359
matter do you think it should be on the

1862
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:54,238
label and and if so why

1863
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:55,759
yeah i believe in truth and advertising

1864
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,639
um

1865
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:02,079
unfortunately the industry is

1866
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:05,360
not self-policed on quality control

1867
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:06,479
isn't what it really needs to be and

1868
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,479
um

1869
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:10,799
i

1870
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:13,039
would always worry about how it was

1871
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:16,159
produced whether it was pure

1872
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:17,519
uh whether it actually was synthetic

1873
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,839
rather than

1874
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,719
derive from cannabis

1875
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:25,600
so all of these things are germane on

1876
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:27,600
their things that i think the consumer

1877
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,440
deserves to know

1878
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,320
well that begs the question you know i i

1879
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:33,519
did

1880
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:35,359
a show a while back with uh uh greg

1881
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:38,239
gerdeman about

1882
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:41,679
synthetic cannabinoids um

1883
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:43,198
both the you know the creation of

1884
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:46,560
cannabinoids that we're familiar with

1885
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:48,238
like thc and cbd in a synthetic manner

1886
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,560
but also the kind of synthetic

1887
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:52,559
cannabinoids that are used for testing

1888
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,840
and research in the lab and don't really

1889
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,280
have much use outside of the lab

1890
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,159
but the way that you answered that

1891
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:00,639
question

1892
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:04,399
makes me super curious

1893
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:06,000
does it matter if a cannabinoid in this

1894
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:08,639
case cbg

1895
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,439
is from the plant or if it is made

1896
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:15,280
through a synthetic process in the end

1897
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:16,799
it is the same molecule or no well it

1898
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:18,079
it should be

1899
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,679
but

1900
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,479
sometimes

1901
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,079
these syntheses will produce byproducts

1902
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:26,079
that could be contaminants and

1903
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,279
potentially toxic so that's always a

1904
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:30,399
concern

1905
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:32,279
also it has to be the right stereoisomer

1906
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:35,198
in other words have the right

1907
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:37,840
three-dimensional configuration

1908
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:39,839
to have the same activity as the natural

1909
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,880
compound from the plant

1910
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:45,039
so these are all considerations

1911
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,440
ideally

1912
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:49,439
it will all need to be

1913
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:52,158
cannabis derived

1914
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:55,198
to produce a pharmaceutical that isn't

1915
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:58,158
considered a combination drug and then

1916
01:14:55,198 --> 01:15:00,158
in specific states such as new york um

1917
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:03,198
any additions have to be cannabis

1918
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:05,250
derived that's part of the law there

1919
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,559
so i think it is important and

1920
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:08,800
[Music]

1921
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,800
irrespective of what i think this is

1922
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,640
going to be a requirement in certain

1923
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,000
contexts

1924
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,000
right on well that's interesting all

1925
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,800
right so so let's let's finish this on

1926
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,679
an upbeat positive note there ethan so

1927
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,760
um

1928
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,960
looking forward i know that you are very

1929
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:28,960
attracted to cbg and you are already

1930
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:31,279
looking at um your next work along the

1931
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,960
same line of thought would you give us a

1932
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:34,399
little idea of of what you're going to

1933
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,760
be doing next

1934
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:38,960
ah sure

1935
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,800
uh well truth be told i'm associated

1936
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,039
with a company called endura

1937
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,719
pharmaceuticals out of vancouver british

1938
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:48,399
columbia

1939
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:49,439
and cbg pretends to be a big part of its

1940
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:51,359
future

1941
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:53,678
and this would be for two

1942
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:55,599
indications that really weren't picked

1943
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,600
up to any degree

1944
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,920
in the survey

1945
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,800
but these are all based on available

1946
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:06,239
past science and specifically they are

1947
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,440
treatment of cancer as we mentioned um

1948
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,359
[Music]

1949
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:11,919
there's certain cancers that when

1950
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:14,079
they're metastatic we don't have any

1951
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,840
current conventional drugs that are able

1952
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:18,319
to treat them but

1953
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,319
cbg seems to be

1954
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:21,319
especially

1955
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:24,960
promising

1956
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,039
in treating prostate cancer and breast

1957
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,198
cancer and those are

1958
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,840
two of the most common

1959
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:32,799
cancers that become metastatic

1960
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,800
and then

1961
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:38,880
hard or sometimes impossible to treat

1962
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,679
so that's one area and the other one is

1963
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:44,079
antibiotics

1964
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,600
we're seeing phenomenal results from the

1965
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:49,198
lab

1966
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:51,679
in terms of cbg is a treatment for

1967
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:54,879
infections including these antibiotic

1968
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:56,158
resistant infections mrsa as i mentioned

1969
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,880
but also

1970
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:00,479
vancomycin resistant enterococcus which

1971
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,560
is responsible

1972
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,158
for a lot of hospital-acquired

1973
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:08,159
infections and

1974
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:08,158
a significant number of deaths

1975
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,960
so

1976
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,520
one of the exciting things about that is

1977
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,158
so far from the lab

1978
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,360
uh we don't have any indication that

1979
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:24,238
these bacteria will develop resistance

1980
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:26,559
uh to cannabinoid as they do to

1981
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,879
conventional antibiotics

1982
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:31,120
um so this this really may be

1983
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:35,119
revolutionary

1984
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:39,039
my hope is again that we've provided

1985
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:40,158
a pattern of human use that indicates

1986
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:41,760
safety

1987
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:43,198
of these products which is going to

1988
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,920
facilitate

1989
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:48,639
um moving them into the clinic for these

1990
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,640
specific indications i've got this huge

1991
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,320
smile over here ethan because you know i

1992
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,920
was i was wrapping up the show and i was

1993
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:55,840
giving you kind of a phishing question

1994
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,399
and and then you dropped on this

1995
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,199
cannabis or excuse me uh cancer

1996
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:03,359
and antibiotics these are both huge

1997
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:04,879
applications that uh be you know because

1998
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,039
they weren't part of the purview the

1999
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,480
study i had not heard that they were

2000
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:10,479
happening because they're happening in

2001
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:13,599
private labs like you said

2002
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:15,759
um that's uh that's very exciting uh is

2003
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,679
there any public research that's

2004
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,640
available like you know as somebody

2005
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:23,600
who's interested in both cbg and uh

2006
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,320
doing um support for for for cancer

2007
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,320
patients are there any studies out there

2008
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:30,238
that or or you know of taking place that

2009
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:31,599
are going to come out where where we can

2010
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:32,399
read more

2011
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,840
uh

2012
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,359
yeah the

2013
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,600
study by abendino on canadiral

2014
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:42,479
