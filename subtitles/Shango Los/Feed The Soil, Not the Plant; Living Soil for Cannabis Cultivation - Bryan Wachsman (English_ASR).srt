hear about living soils I'm actually a

36
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,630
huge advocate of shengo's podcasts I've

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,969
learned a lot from those there's a lot

38
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:47,869
of guys keep it simple organics I've

39
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:49,939
done

40
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,950
brown guy for 20 there's a couple of

41
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,709
just well-known guys out there with

42
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,560
podcasts including mister Shengo Lois

43
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:59,329
that I really think is beneficial for

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,730
you guys to listen to as well and of

45
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:02,480
course they're all free so I started

46
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,439
growing cannabis

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,060
ten years ago I've been cultivating

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,848
living soils for four years and I've

49
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,800
been educating about cannabis for two

50
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:17,899
years so I started out growing cannabis

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,180
using an aeroponic machine I was

52
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,599
in house and garden nutrients bottled

53
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,549
nutrients just really a and B type basic

54
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,199
stuff adding adding the amendments the

55
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:29,150
shooting powers of powder and all the

56
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,158
things that house and garden makes you

57
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,989
think that you need to use and I started

58
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:35,209
to educate myself about the pesticides

59
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:36,859
that were being used and I got a job as

60
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,259
a commercial cultivator in Denver

61
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:41,329
Colorado what I quickly found out is

62
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:44,328
that nobody checked what we were doing

63
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:47,540
so my boss was having me spray avid

64
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,579
forbid eagle 20 and these things caught

65
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:52,068
up with them so I'd like to point out

66
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:54,170
that this is my old company about five

67
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:57,229
years ago and this is how much these

68
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:59,839
guys got in trouble for batch violations

69
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:01,759
these are all batch violations in Denver

70
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,469
Colorado so for the guys out in

71
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,828
California not really the guys fear in

72
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:09,318
Oregon if you display spray my club you

73
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:11,480
know you are going to fail and you are

74
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:13,208
probably going to lose your company so

75
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,929
it is it vital that some of these

76
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,188
techniques that I'm going to talk about

77
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,930
today and some of the other speakers

78
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:20,930
that are here today and you can find a

79
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,209
way to grow cannabis using beneficial

80
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,810
bugs beneficial predator mites they're

81
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:29,449
going to be ahead of the game so I

82
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,719
started my living soil research through

83
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:35,629
dr. Alaine in him then I learned about

84
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,430
Jeff low in Fell's and then I started to

85
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:40,518
incorporate those techniques into my own

86
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:42,109
personal grow try to get my my skill set

87
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,969
back up to where it needs to be growing

88
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,040
cannabis using a living soil instead of

89
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,769
synthetics and then once I started to

90
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,908
hone those skills I started to kind of

91
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,680
make a little name for myself in

92
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:53,870
Colorado people really started to like

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,370
the cannabis that I was growing I was

94
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,620
educating around and then I was picked

95
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,500
up by Green Farms last year in October

96
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,219
of 2017 and now I ate all around the

97
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,658
country and I'm a huge proponent for you

98
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,139
know just trying to get the home grower

99
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:09,199
to understand that they can grow

100
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:15,089
pennies on the dollar compared to the

101
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:17,009
average cost of synthetics so I'm like I

102
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,790
was saying I'm big on education Here I

103
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:24,779
am in Denver educating the home drawers

104
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,400
if you will of our city i here i am with

105
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,750
debra normal and i would like to

106
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,909
apologize there are some of my slides

107
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,889
that are a little bit yellow or here i

108
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,240
don't know kind of what's going on there

109
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,680
so some of these slides if they're a

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,569
little bit different i'd be happy to

111
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,569
send you the slideshow if need be

112
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,129
here we are educating at a symposium as

113
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:46,199
well so at least in denver the living

114
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:47,399
soil community is alive and thriving

115
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,349
have you guys ever come to Colorado

116
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,939
please let me know because I'd love to

117
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,220
introduce you some of the brightest

118
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,139
minds I think at least in our little

119
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,150
area I'll get to hang out and we all get

120
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,599
to kind of trade secrets and that kind

121
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:04,589
of thing I'm also going to judge for

122
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,600
cannabis cups which I am Arda and Here I

123
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:09,269
am with this is the founder of Denver

124
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,479
normal and the the founder of normal

125
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:14,039
itself Keith Stroup and Jordan person

126
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,930
this is a special photo for me because

127
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,939
the reason we all get to smoke cannabis

128
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,560
is because of this gentleman right here

129
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,389
and the reason I get to smoke cannabis

130
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,939
freely and dumber is because of this

131
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:27,569
woman right here so pay a little homage

132
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:29,910
to them alright let's get to the meat of

133
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:31,500
why we're here when I started out this

134
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,660
was actually the shelf that I've

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,660
actually started buying my products from

136
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,490
so I've kind of gone full circle I've

137
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,010
gone from this synthetics and now we're

138
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,840
using the soil food web to use soil

139
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:47,459
microbes to grow the elite canvas

140
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:50,759
instead of the synthetics for me this is

141
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,709
how I was able to come to the full steps

142
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,589
of what I guess you could call almost

143
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:57,239
like a cultivation specialist and for me

144
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,119
I started off learning more about the

145
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,439
Rev with true living organics there are

146
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,519
some I don't know how many people have

147
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,959
read that book but there are some

148
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,609
nutrition spikes and stuff like that

149
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,978
that really isn't a living soil system

150
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,439
and I continue to educate myself I

151
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:13,168
started making this super soil by sub

152
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,740
cool that is more like a mixture you

153
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:15,750
kind of have

154
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,990
I sit in a corner for about six weeks

155
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,180
and let it cook if you will that takes

156
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,430
up a lot of space a lot of time and to

157
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,959
be honest some of the some of the plants

158
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,490
that I was growing you would see certain

159
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,948
deficiencies because maybe I just didn't

160
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,870
mix it up correctly or just some human

161
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,728
errors and stuff so I continued my

162
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,918
education and then I found out that I

163
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:37,050
could grow with soil microbes with red

164
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,299
wigglers with African nightcrawlers

165
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,579
white spring tail mites and all of those

166
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,319
are breaking down organic matter into

167
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:45,598
carbon and then the carbon is feeding

168
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,259
the soil food web so as I continue to

169
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:51,089
climb that ladder I began to then read

170
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,919
Jeff Lowenthal's books he has teeming

171
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:55,198
with microbes teeming with nutrients and

172
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,658
teeming with fungi which I could I have

173
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,069
right here so if you guys have not read

174
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:01,199
those books I highly recommend it

175
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,729
because it's those are game changers

176
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,449
especially if you're trying to move from

177
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:08,459
this intact world into the living soils

178
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:11,120
and then finally this is kind of where

179
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:13,500
I'm at right now I have a gentleman in

180
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,709
Colorado that's teaching me more about

181
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,288
what Colorado natural farming with the

182
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:20,788
indigenous microorganisms and that's

183
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:24,389
kind of where I feel if you're going

184
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:26,069
going to the the top level of living

185
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,840
soil that is probably where you're gonna

186
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,839
have to be is to learn about ferments

187
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,718
learn to make sprouted CTS and all these

188
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:37,468
things are cheap ingredients and easy

189
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:39,629
easy to implement so for a lot of people

190
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:41,250
especially me when I first started I had

191
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,168
no idea that the cannabis plant is

192
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,269
autotrophic meaning that it can feed

193
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:47,008
itself and that simply is just the

194
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:49,109
microbes breaking down organic matter

195
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,240
and then the exudates from the plants

196
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,949
which is really just like sugars you're

197
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,478
talking about a little bit of sugar a

198
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,370
little bit of protein and a little bit

199
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,439
of carbohydrates so I don't know if

200
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,870
there's any bakers in here but usually

201
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,120
what what is that recipe we're talking

202
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,949
cakes we're talking cookies so that's

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,149
what it attracts the soil microbes and

204
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,759
then they work in a symbiotic

205
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:14,008
relationship to build that soil food web

206
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:16,620
to where it is thriving so cannabis

207
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,080
plants actually prefer in a living soil

208
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:24,209
system prefer to grow out and why then

209
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:27,779
deep and deep and down so when I grow

210
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:30,779
I focus on 2025 gallon pots min ammonia

211
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:33,149
I don't know why that keeps changing and

212
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,978
then if you guys can notice the the

213
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,889
roots itself really only go up go down

214
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,500
about 36 inches and then they kind of

215
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:42,208
like spread out more year so for some of

216
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,000
those pots that you see that are more

217
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,588
depth but not not really wide in my

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,700
opinion those are almost pointless if

219
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,350
you're trying to grow on a living soil

220
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,899
system if you're using for the

221
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,240
synthetics then they're okay but if

222
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,679
you're using a soil system you're need

223
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,720
to use air pause and you need to use

224
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,250
lava rocks and sphagnum peat moss and

225
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,050
everything needs to be organic to make

226
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,850
sure that you're continuing to build

227
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:07,879
that soil food web alright so one of the

228
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,950
the easy examples for using a cover crop

229
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,200
is that this is bare soil so we have an

230
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,930
extreme amount of runoff and then when

231
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,160
we're actually growing with a cover crop

232
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:19,229
we're building up the rhizosphere

233
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,169
and that's allowing the water to not

234
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,750
have pretty much any runoff and it's a

235
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:27,028
lot cleaner obviously then you know the

236
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:33,389
the soil that doesn't contain any life

237
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:36,600
whatsoever a lot of people have been

238
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:39,179
asking especially in California is are

239
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,970
we able to implement this on a

240
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,500
commercial level and I can show you that

241
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,000
even at a small-time farm this is my

242
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,759
little homegirl right here on the left

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,100
and then we do consulting all around the

244
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,278
all around the country really for living

245
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,139
soil systems on a commercial setting so

246
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,389
what we're usually do is walk in see how

247
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,879
they implement usually if they are going

248
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:02,699
soils we'll just add the microbes and

249
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,289
compost teas and get the microbe life to

250
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,589
start building up and then as soon as

251
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:09,778
that happens we really try to focus on

252
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:14,220
specific compost teas fungal teas

253
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:15,899
bacterial teas that kind of thing here's

254
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,360
a grow that we did some consulting for

255
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:21,019
in Puebla these guys were growing

256
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,019
synthetics

257
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:28,040
down at webelo we just got a bunch of

258
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:31,299
our vantage move over to flower here or

259
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,299
move you guys to see all this

260
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,500
these are just flowers - they are

261
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:41,500
startled our new stretch

262
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:04,120
how many of you in here are growing in a

263
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,620
commercial setting how many of you use

264
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:17,019
of living soil in that commercial

265
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:18,250
setting ok so again these are normally

266
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:20,620
class I don't know why that's not

267
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,470
showing up there but this is really the

268
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,269
the key macronutrients obviously is NPK

269
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,540
everybody knows that nitrogen phosphorus

270
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:31,149
potassium but in my opinion it's calcium

271
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:33,279
that we as living soil farmers need to

272
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,529
really focus on because calcium only

273
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,569
comes through the transpiration stream

274
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,669
meaning we have to get the plant to take

275
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,440
that up and the more calcium that we

276
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,909
take up the better the plants gonna do

277
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,670
in the last few weeks as she begins to

278
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:48,100
flower out so I really focus on building

279
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:49,779
that calcium up using amino acids to

280
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,450
make sure that she's able to take up

281
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:55,480
more calcium and then that will actually

282
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,879
build up the pectin within the cell wall

283
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,800
itself that will turn into our tactic

284
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,689
acid that will turn into pectin and the

285
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:04,839
pectin is the glue that holds the cell

286
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,820
walls together so you know really the

287
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,920
goal to grow high end cannabis using a

288
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,370
living soil system is to also focus on

289
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,559
the calcium not just magnesium or I like

290
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,120
to separate the two so I will use a

291
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,709
little bit of calcium and I will use a

292
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,289
little bit of magnesium but I don't like

293
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:23,350
the cal-mag type where it's formulated

294
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:25,209
already for me nitrogen is the growth

295
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,480
element so what I mean when I'm growing

296
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,889
in a vegetative state I focus on making

297
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,170
sure that she's getting enough nitrogen

298
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,179
almost like a Goldilocks principle where

299
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,259
I don't want to make sure this I I want

300
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,299
to make sure that she's not eating

301
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:40,059
nitrate nitrogen because she will take

302
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:41,919
that up no matter what so if I'm a newer

303
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,349
grower and I'm it says to use five

304
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,990
milliliters of the nitrate nitrogen

305
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,029
formula I tried nitrogen a lot of new

306
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,549
growers are used like 10 milliliters so

307
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,409
as you start to see later in Flour she's

308
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:55,240
still burning up that nitrate nitrogen

309
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:56,980
it's kind of like me with peanut butter

310
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,690
M&amp;Ms it doesn't matter

311
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,250
time of the night it is I will eat those

312
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,920
no matter what's going on and it's kind

313
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,480
of the same thing with nitrate nitrogen

314
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,689
she will take that up no matter what so

315
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,629
you'll get huge the internet'll spacing

316
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,670
will be a lot different I'll be almost

317
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:15,759
like a foot sometimes six inches to a

318
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:18,189
foot and spacing where if I'm you know

319
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:21,009
growing correctly I want to have maybe

320
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:24,100
maybe three or four inches of internal

321
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:27,189
internodal spacing the phosphorus is the

322
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,019
energy element I found a lot of the leek

323
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,970
growers are using that as kind of like a

324
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,490
spark or a catalyst before they start

325
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,699
using nitrogen they try to get the the

326
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,198
root structure to start to build

327
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:39,939
potassium is the health element to me

328
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:42,490
this is where a lot of plants will

329
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,839
actually show a hidden hunger and so

330
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,459
when you're when you're starting to

331
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,839
flower out the last few weeks if you

332
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,028
don't have enough potassium they

333
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,680
actually will just stop growing and a

334
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,689
lot of the newer growers home growers

335
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:55,620
don't really notice that until it's too

336
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:58,300
late so if there's not enough potassium

337
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,659
she just it's almost like a hidden

338
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,189
hunger she just won't what's the word

339
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:05,198
I'm looking for

340
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:08,620
she won't flower out and she won't she

341
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,929
won't show her true to tendencies and

342
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,789
that kind of stuff without proper

343
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:16,208
potassium and then like I was saying

344
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:18,219
calcium is that Vigna hidden element it

345
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:23,379
really is the key I think to growing

346
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:26,560
elite cameras so we're cultivating

347
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:28,919
cannabis and we're using a I would say

348
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,838
our brain and mother nature to improve

349
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,088
the lifestyle of a grower so when I'm

350
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,480
growing I don't have to worry about pH

351
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,050
levels I use red wigglers white spring

352
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,959
tell mites

353
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:42,490
African nightcrawlers to break down that

354
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,948
organic matter like I was saying and

355
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,629
they will regulate the pH levels with

356
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:49,318
the plant communicating with the plant

357
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:51,578
through exudates

358
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:55,328
growing with microbes like I was saying

359
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:58,179
a we it gives us the grower and the

360
00:14:55,328 --> 00:15:00,309
confidence back to be able to grow the

361
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:01,789
plant in a way where we are more like

362
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:03,889
coach and we kind of

363
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:05,750
back up and we focus on letting her

364
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:07,490
become these Serena Williams if you will

365
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,889
and I'm trying to get her ready for

366
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,370
Wimbledon and flower so I'm on her big

367
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:15,740
and stocky strong and so that's why some

368
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,879
of the reasons I focused on the microbes

369
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,269
is you're just not going to be able to

370
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,939
achieve that with synthetics in the long

371
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:25,639
run so I used the same soil over and

372
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,560
over again so my soil improves year

373
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,710
after year I'm about four and a half

374
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,509
years using the same soil and you guys

375
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,610
would probably laugh at my my work week

376
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:36,769
because we were talking maybe you know a

377
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,899
couple hours a day compared to a lot of

378
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,509
the guys that are synthetics mixing

379
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,250
nutrients worried about pH levels the

380
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,439
up-and-down of when you're you know a

381
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,059
beginning farmer you kind of put a

382
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,550
little too much and then you put a

383
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:51,679
little pH up and I don't worry about any

384
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:54,259
of that stuff so I highly recommend that

385
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,359
you guys continue to educate yourself on

386
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:58,490
why pH levels are just not as important

387
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,860
in the living soil system because we're

388
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:05,480
not charge anymore does that make any

389
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:08,230
sense yeah and then the white spring

390
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,029
tone mics for me are kind of like the

391
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:14,539
the secret sauce if you will they work

392
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:18,860
in a symbiotic relationship with the red

393
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:21,679
wigglers and the the African back

394
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:25,009
collars I'm sorry guys and they kind of

395
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:28,719
break down the organic matter and turn

396
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:28,720
it into food into carbon

397
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:33,408
so with a living soil system we have

398
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:35,328
found on a commercial level that we can

399
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:38,568
literally grow for pennies on the dollar

400
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:40,758
compared to conventional methods so I

401
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:42,498
guess that you reusing the same soil I'm

402
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,298
able to get the full genetic profiles

403
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:46,009
for some of you guys that are really

404
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:49,028
like fino hunters and go out there and

405
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:51,589
try to find some of the best cannabis

406
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:53,749
genetics you can find especially

407
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:56,809
downstairs there's some famous people

408
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:58,399
out there I'm getting the full genetic

409
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,808
profile so I'm getting the blues and the

410
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,458
purples and the stuff that a lot of the

411
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:03,168
other farmers just aren't able to

412
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,778
achieve because they are using

413
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:07,849
synthetics instead of using microbes so

414
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:10,068
the plant can actually say like you know

415
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,898
communicating through through the

416
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:13,999
exudates with the microbes oh I'd like a

417
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:15,768
little bit of Chinese food today on

418
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:18,199
Monday oh I'd like a little bit of a

419
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:19,699
like a burger on Tuesday so it allows

420
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:25,038
the plant to decide what she needs

421
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:27,580
instead of me trying to force-feed the

422
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:32,359
rhizomes fear is really the the secret

423
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:35,628
to every plant that's growing and like

424
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:39,798
if I just do this right here in my hand

425
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:41,928
right here I have more soil microbes and

426
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,210
there are people on this planet so we

427
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:47,950
were talking upon we rolled upon worlds

428
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,950
upon worlds that we begin to grow with

429
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,840
so growing with my colossal fungi is

430
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,569
anybody here familiar with my brother

431
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,609
plunger yeah I would ask this question

432
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:05,279
maybe a year two years ago nobody had a

433
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:07,740
clue so to keep it simple this is almost

434
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,599
like a dial-up internet of communication

435
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,819
going on within your soil there's almost

436
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,009
no communication takes forever for the

437
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:17,399
exhibits to communicate once the mike

438
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:19,079
rizzo fungi is implemented and begins to

439
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,300
grow this is almost like a fiber-optic

440
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,599
network so we're talking fast

441
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:30,419
communication which really speeds up the

442
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:32,219
soil food web I like to go mycelium

443
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,220
hunting so this is what's known as

444
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,500
mycelium carpet I do not buy my mike

445
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,870
rizzo fungi I will actually go out into

446
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,730
nature I take about 10% of what you

447
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:44,159
would see and then I spread all those

448
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,710
spores around to kind of improve on

449
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,310
nature since I took away from nature and

450
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,779
this is a fantastic way to build up your

451
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:53,460
soil food web without having to spend a

452
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,920
lot of money and going out and giving

453
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,710
the mycorrhizal fungi which in all

454
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,240
honesty they come from two places so all

455
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,039
the companies that are selling microbes

456
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,259
and fungi they're buying it from the

457
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,670
same source so if it's a little bit

458
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:11,069
better of a product usually that just

459
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:14,759
means they've been adding more I have a

460
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:17,429
little bit of outdoor amendments added

461
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,619
as well and then you can see as things

462
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:23,220
begin to grow in my indoor I can really

463
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:25,500
get the mycelium carpet of my project to

464
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,450
show up in the sunlight and for a living

465
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,819
soil system grower that's almost like a

466
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,009
three light it's kind of where you pat

467
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,539
yourself on the back I will proudly say

468
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:36,150
that in a living soil system I've never

469
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:38,250
grown three pounds of light it's just

470
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:42,000
not it's just not feasible at least for

471
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,509
me yet but I have I will say that the

472
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,670
quality is what matters

473
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:47,920
and making concentrates and that kind of

474
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,100
thing solvent list diamonds is where I

475
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,539
think the market is moving towards and

476
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,339
like back in the day when I would go to

477
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,960
a breeder and they would make me look

478
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:58,089
fantastic because I would buy their

479
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,470
genetics I would grow them out and then

480
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:01,359
everybody would be like well you're such

481
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,980
a great grower I'm going to in reality

482
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,490
is the breeder that's making me look

483
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,980
great

484
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,440
and I think now this the situation is

485
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,569
moving to where the extraction artists

486
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,430
are looking for guys that grow without

487
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:14,529
using any even neem oil or any

488
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,509
pesticides whatsoever so that they have

489
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,940
that canvas so that they can do their

490
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:22,859
extraction and and show off their

491
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,860
artwork all right

492
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:31,950
here's my old living soil really broken

493
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,590
down lots of red wigglers lots of white

494
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:39,029
spring tell mines and then this is the

495
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:41,519
new soil here so I just added Miller's

496
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:44,910
verbal compost and then I added a little

497
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:48,389
crustacean meal and then I'm you trying

498
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:51,630
to get the tops the top microbes to

499
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:54,780
start thriving and that really starts

500
00:20:51,630 --> 00:21:00,630
which is taking from the old and putting

501
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:04,079
in the new so one of the reasons I add

502
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:06,240
crustacean mil is for kite so once I had

503
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,250
chitin or insect frass the same thing

504
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,960
you're adding up chitin to the top soil

505
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,599
the plant actually thinks it's being

506
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,640
attacked by bugs so she will build up an

507
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,589
immune system through kite maze and

508
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,750
using that chitin when it turns into

509
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:20,699
chitin aids is basically like an immune

510
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,619
shot for the plant so it's a healthy way

511
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,080
to build up the immune system without

512
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:30,059
using anything synthetic all mother

513
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:33,089
nature the worms that I focus on are

514
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:35,190
again the red wigglers and the African

515
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:37,829
night crawlers so the red wigglers were

516
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,559
actually assimilated it basically at the

517
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:42,659
top probably 4 or 5 inches most of where

518
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,429
the rhizosphere is and then the African

519
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,490
night crawlers will kind of work the

520
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:50,190
medium section of the soil itself and

521
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,450
then I was trying to use the Canadian

522
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,610
night crawlers because I know that they

523
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,620
like to bury pretty deep and that they

524
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:57,449
would kind of build up that dissolved

525
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:58,609
oxygen for me with the channels and

526
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,269
everything that they're moving around

527
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,849
unfortunately the reason why they're

528
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:04,769
called night crawlers is when in night

529
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:07,079
occurs they actually go to the top to

530
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,549
feed and Canadian night crawlers are so

531
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,549
stupid that they actually just fall out

532
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:13,409
of the pot itself and die so it's kind

533
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:15,210
of a waste of money with that so I use

534
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,360
lava rocks instead to kind of do it that

535
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:21,440
up you can track in a midnight colors if

536
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,359
you like it's kind of a waste of money

537
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,420
so using the worms I'm building up the

538
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,519
biofilm within the soil structure itself

539
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,679
now I know a lot of

540
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,959
people don't have room to build larger

541
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,669
worm farms so we actually teach our

542
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:36,649
students and Colorado a pretty cool

543
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:40,969
trick what we do is we'll take an

544
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:47,689
avocado we cut it with an X kind of like

545
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:50,359
a baked potato and then I squeeze that

546
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,369
let it pop open and then I take the

547
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:55,878
fleshy part and I still stick it into

548
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:56,958
the soil itself the fats and the the

549
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:59,178
Ryan and everything that's in the

550
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,798
avocado the red wigglers are attracted

551
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:02,749
to that so they will actually come up

552
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,628
from the soil itself to the top where

553
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:08,629
I've just placed this avocado and they

554
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:10,189
will begin to kind of touch each other

555
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:13,009
and kind of move around and then

556
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,838
one-third hermaphrodites so as soon as

557
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:16,878
they touch each other what happens is

558
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:18,858
they begin to reproduce so our joke in

559
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:21,048
Colorado is that when we put these in

560
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:23,058
our 25 gallon 50 gallon 100 gallon pots

561
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:24,888
these become like little fraternity

562
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:27,048
houses if you will and there's a lot of

563
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:29,358
reproduction going on so the more I can

564
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:32,569
put around into my soil five or six

565
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:33,858
avocados in about 30 days I'll have you

566
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:36,528
know a couple hundred worms and then

567
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:38,868
another 90 days they reproduce their

568
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:40,819
entire population so it's an easy way

569
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:42,199
for you guys to buy a little bit of

570
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,848
worms I have a buddy that will give you

571
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,369
a little bit of worms and then you can

572
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:47,868
build and not have to pay the especially

573
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:49,278
for commercial growing I mean

574
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:51,439
worms are one of the more expensive

575
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,058
things in a living soil system so this

576
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,328
is just a way for you guys to be able to

577
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:58,548
add red wigglers to your system without

578
00:23:56,328 --> 00:24:00,348
having to spend any money Michael when

579
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:02,509
I'm teaching especially the home grower

580
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:06,319
is always for you guys to grow for

581
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:09,828
pennies literal pennies compared to your

582
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,509
conventional methods and then once once

583
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:12,798
they've eaten all of the avocado they

584
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:15,229
will literally eat the pit and

585
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,908
everything if the soil is alive and

586
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:18,259
thriving it might only take like a week

587
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:20,269
to two weeks for them to break

588
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,990
everything down and once that's going on

589
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,000
you guys want

590
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,849
you have a huge total life our soil

591
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,679
that's thriving and that's when you know

592
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:34,490
really you're only using water at that

593
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:38,570
point to grow high in cannabis down here

594
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:41,359
we just bought a bunch of buckets for

595
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:42,769
worms so here's all the baby worms that

596
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,339
are actually hatching along with the

597
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:47,929
white spring tail lights so we're

598
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:50,178
starting to get everything down and

599
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:52,850
webelo the way that we like to do it

600
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,730
which is using living living soils is

601
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:58,579
also using red wigglers to drive

602
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,960
everything and increase the biodiversity

603
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:05,569
that is almost like what we're known for

604
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,509
biodiversity is king so the more diverse

605
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:10,519
compost that we have the more diverse

606
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:13,400
microbes we have the fuller genetic

607
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:18,230
profiles we can achieve growing high in

608
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:20,240
canvas so you can see in this video all

609
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,579
the little white the little tiny white

610
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,349
those are all the baby worms that have

611
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:25,369
just hatched from the avocado trick that

612
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:27,709
I was telling you guys about

613
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:29,509
so it really only takes maybe a week two

614
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,269
weeks at most start to really see the

615
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:34,069
benefits of just having a adding the

616
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:35,960
avocado and of course all the other

617
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:37,789
stuff is the white spring tail mites so

618
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,069
they basically hitch a ride on the worms

619
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:42,500
and the worms build the dissolved oxygen

620
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:44,119
channels for you and then the white

621
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:48,500
springtime is kind of just take a ride

622
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:51,319
on and break down everything as well the

623
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,240
key to the soil food web is the food

624
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,308
that it provides so the bacteria and the

625
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,370
fungi are actually the the food source

626
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:59,750
so they're breaking down things it's

627
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:02,689
common that a lot of people think that

628
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,609
worms will actually eat like the fruits

629
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,990
the banana peels that kind of stuff they

630
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:08,449
don't they actually eat the bacteria

631
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,429
that's breaking down that material so

632
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,620
the more bacteria that you see in your

633
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:14,600
soil the healthier you know that at

634
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:17,509
least a veg that the plan is

635
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:21,649
almost ready for its wimpleton if you

636
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:23,900
will right that's the goal is to get the

637
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,309
plant ready for that and the bacteria

638
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,470
and the fungi as they're starting to

639
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:30,379
grow than the protozoa and nematodes eat

640
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,298
that they're like fertilizer bags and

641
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,250
then the nematodes and the Protestant

642
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:36,558
protozoa spread that around within the

643
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,779
soil system itself so if you find a

644
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,000
nature usually the good guys work in a

645
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:43,129
symbiotic relationship and the bad guys

646
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,009
when I have have almost like an alpha

647
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:48,500
one of the Alpha microbes will usually

648
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:50,329
take over so that's why when you're

649
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,640
using the compost teas and you're adding

650
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:53,859
a lot of sugar at the end we have found

651
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,380
that that's actually kind of a bad idea

652
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:59,959
because it speeds up those alphas where

653
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,000
when I'm making a compost tea my goal is

654
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,130
almost like a shotgun approach I'm

655
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,099
trying to get as much diversity through

656
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:11,260
those microbes onto the soils and as

657
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:11,259
well onto the leaf structure itself I

658
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,798
get a lot of people asking me on

659
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,380
Instagram that kind of thing does show

660
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:20,329
me a lot of different bugs springtails

661
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,070
do not fly so I actually made a video

662
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:24,619
for that because a lot of these guys

663
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:26,450
were showing me what had gone so I don't

664
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,548
even know what book that was but if it's

665
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:32,179
flying around that is not that is not a

666
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:35,629
white spring tomac I've been getting

667
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:39,470
some questions online what might spring

668
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:41,480
tail mites are and if you see they jump

669
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,690
they don't fly

670
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,269
some of you guys send me videos little

671
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,630
white bugs flying around in your soil I

672
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:52,308
actually don't really know what that is

673
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,320
but I can tell you that if you have the

674
00:27:52,308 --> 00:27:58,099
white spring tell mine at least that

675
00:27:54,319 --> 00:28:00,470
we're using here in Colorado these

676
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:03,219
things do not fly it moves fast

677
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,470
throughout the soil and they can jump

678
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:09,350
but that's it

679
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:12,220
we basically monitor the white spring

680
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:16,579
till my population and it kind of gauges

681
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:19,339
to us how much bacteria is really within

682
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:24,279
the soil and so without having to

683
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:24,279
constantly look at it using a microscope

684
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,888
so as you guys can see in all my bets

685
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,350
whether it's you know in fetch I'm using

686
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:35,629
a cover crop if it's in flower I'm still

687
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:38,599
covering that soil with like a timothy

688
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,759
hay barley hay kind of setup and the

689
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,500
reason is there's no bare soil in nature

690
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:45,139
and we're trying to replicate the

691
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,119
redwood forest if you will in in the

692
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:49,638
living soil systems inside our inside

693
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:52,308
grouse and so that's why we never let

694
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:54,859
anything be bare to make sure that we

695
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:56,690
never have to really add a bunch of

696
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,548
inputs once everything's alive and

697
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,870
thriving the less you have to deal with

698
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:02,329
it the better off you'll be

699
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:03,709
so the it's almost like I have a lot of

700
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:06,230
guys who are like okay now what do I do

701
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,210
we'll go outside go go hang out with

702
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,319
your family you don't have to pH anymore

703
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,480
you don't have to worry about all the

704
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:13,819
things and a lot of the side work if you

705
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,589
will of growing cannabis all that

706
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:19,519
stuff's gone away now that we're using

707
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:21,589
Mother Nature to churn the soil for us I

708
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,298
will said that it takes about a year to

709
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:26,898
really get the yields that you probably

710
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:30,109
accustomed to using synthetics that's

711
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:32,028
just I guess one of the one of the cons

712
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:33,888
of growing in a living soil system but I

713
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:35,450
assure you the quality of the cannabis

714
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:36,258
that you're growing you will not really

715
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,840
worry about

716
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:40,429
yield anymore and like I was saying

717
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:42,500
before I think the extraction artists

718
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:46,370
and the stuff that that's coming out and

719
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,200
will be coming out in 2019 is that's the

720
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:50,898
high-end stuff the solvent list diamonds

721
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,759
in my opinion that's what the market is

722
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:54,758
moving towards is the extracts

723
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:01,530
so I grow with a cover crop and part of

724
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,269
that is obviously no bare soil but I'm

725
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:05,009
also adding with crimson clover I'm

726
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:06,389
adding nitrogen from the air and it's

727
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:09,390
pulling the nitrogen into the soil

728
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:11,550
itself and it's building a barrier where

729
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,320
the good microbes can thrive and it's a

730
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:14,759
lot harder for the bad microbes to

731
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,579
thrive because there's almost no food

732
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,619
source so if I have a root here and I

733
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:21,539
have my bacteria my fungi constantly

734
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:25,019
eating there's no room for the bad

735
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:27,899
bacteria and the bad microbes to be able

736
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:29,369
to have a food source so a lot of the

737
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,530
times as long as you have a symbiotic

738
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:34,919
symbiotic relationship you don't even

739
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:38,579
really have to worry about bad nematodes

740
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,350
that kind of thing the cover crop here

741
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:42,720
in this photo let me know that I had a

742
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:46,469
thread problem so it started over here

743
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,390
and then it began on the plan itself and

744
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,519
then when I walked into my room I saw

745
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,290
ladybugs and a bunch of praying baby

746
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,629
praying mantis on the plant itself and

747
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:55,950
for me that's a red flag I know that

748
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,480
there's something on that plant and I

749
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:01,970
need to pay attention to it or maybe I

750
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,970
need to move it remove it from the room

751
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,289
all right so when I do consulting

752
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,980
unfortunately a lot of people don't tell

753
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:10,558
me the truth

754
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,269
and so when I go into a grow one of the

755
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,759
first things I do is I bring my trusty

756
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:18,150
bunny and I put that on there cover crop

757
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:21,269
and I see if she will eat the I will see

758
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:23,009
if she will eat the the cover crop if

759
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:25,019
she eats the cover crop I know that the

760
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:26,519
farmer is telling you the truth if she

761
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,230
doesn't eat the cover crop I know that

762
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,210
there's spraying some kind of pesticide

763
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:34,849
or some kind of fungicide but the bunny

764
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:38,910
itself will not eat that back cover crop

765
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:40,049
so how do we prove that when we grow in

766
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,840
a living soil that we're not using

767
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:43,519
pesticides well for me I like to use a

768
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:45,750
bunny

769
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,929
bunnies are pretty intelligent for their

770
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:52,558
size and they know when to eat leafy

771
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:54,210
green and what not to so if you were

772
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,730
growing in a living solo and you want to

773
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,440
make sure that everything seems as

774
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,650
healthy as possible and you respect

775
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,900
mother nature as much as possible by a

776
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:08,400
little bunny have a little bunny run

777
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:10,320
around and if you choose to eat the

778
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,550
cover crop you know you're doing it

779
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:16,589
right so the bunny as well as alpacas

780
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:19,169
are what's known as a cold manure

781
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:20,459
meaning as soon as they relieve

782
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,529
themselves you can actually take that

783
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,980
and put it on to the the soil system

784
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:30,808
itself you actually break that down so

785
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,670
as she's eating she's pooping it's a

786
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:34,319
cold manure so that's okay with me it's

787
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:38,759
not really gonna affect pH or anything

788
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:43,889
like that the the worms love rabbit poop

789
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:47,400
so it's kind of a continuous system once

790
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:50,250
I start building the bacterial once I

791
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:53,550
now focus on turning that plant into

792
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:55,859
flour I will add fungal aspects into my

793
00:32:53,549 --> 00:33:00,029
soil so I'll begin to add like bran

794
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:02,519
flakes there's a couple other things the

795
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:04,678
avocado is the purple corn and then

796
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,049
those begin to be broken down by the

797
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,259
soil food web and they actually will

798
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:12,058
start to grow that mycelium carpet that

799
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,339
we're after and then once it starts to

800
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:16,019
grow into the sunlight that's when you

801
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:19,500
know that really things are thriving and

802
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:21,210
you're in you're on the right track once

803
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,799
I start to see it show up in the

804
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:29,160
sunlight itself I add kefir which I it's

805
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:31,230
a non LOC lactate dairy product so it's

806
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,930
easier for the plant to take up I don't

807
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,019
know if you guys

808
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:37,150
eaten or drank kefir once I started to

809
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:39,309
see what it did to my plants I now drink

810
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,519
that every single morning and I highly

811
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:44,230
recommend you guys find out about

812
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,079
probiotics prebiotics that kind of stuff

813
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,360
because the focus of a living soil is

814
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:52,089
that we're building a stomach right

815
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:54,099
that's a living breathing thing and if

816
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:57,579
we focus on the inputs that we put in

817
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:59,409
there the output is fantastic what goes

818
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:01,509
in and what comes out it has to be

819
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,190
quality ingredients has to be organic

820
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:04,809
and there's nothing wrong with you know

821
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,400
spending a little extra money on some of

822
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,139
those things now that we don't have to

823
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,418
buy the synthetics and buy all the

824
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,339
amendments that go you know at least

825
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,319
they made me believe for a long time

826
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:16,440
that I had to have one guy you know I

827
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,600
was like synthetics are almost like a

828
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,130
secret sukkah sauce if you will and we

829
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,279
were joking though you know what is that

830
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,300
but it's really just salt and water so

831
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,310
when you're going in there and you're

832
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:31,300
buying something that comes in a bottle

833
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:34,599
and it's with water more than likely the

834
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:39,610
95% of that is in my opinion wasted

835
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:42,039
money so that my ceiling starts to grow

836
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,140
I add the oats and then it really starts

837
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,000
to take off and once I start to see this

838
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,739
I'll usually put them in the dark for

839
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,250
maybe 48 hours before I put them into

840
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:53,678
into flour and then the rest is really

841
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,989
pretty basic just adding water maybe

842
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,570
adding a little bit of

843
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:02,429
amendments to certain plants for the top

844
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:06,180
feet and then this these are friends of

845
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:08,399
mine one of one of the people I really

846
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:10,829
admire is Jeff llama feels like I was I

847
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,030
was speaking on and the other one is dr.

848
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:14,219
Judith Fitzpatrick

849
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,750
she makes the micro bio meter and this

850
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,358
is one of the ways that you can start to

851
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:22,170
test what you're doing at home as far as

852
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:23,989
the the levels of the microbes that you

853
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:26,579
have within your soil system itself

854
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:29,449
Judith did a test on my living soil when

855
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,949
she was out in Colorado and I still I

856
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:34,679
believe so I thought the highest test

857
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:37,909
that's ever been done by Judith the

858
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:41,819
average scores are between 600 and 800 -

859
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:43,618
1755 so you guys can see that like you

860
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,240
know growing living soils and paying

861
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,849
paying attention to the inputs that

862
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:49,049
you're putting in I'm excited to now see

863
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:51,960
that there's other companies that are

864
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,880
making products where we can see for

865
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,858
ourselves the amount of work that we're

866
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,890
putting in and and the outputs that are

867
00:35:55,858 --> 00:36:00,569
coming out so all that has come from the

868
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:03,029
few books that I've read like I was

869
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:05,789
saying because Shango who loses podcasts

870
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:10,740
I'm self-taught so I encourage you guys

871
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:14,119
that you know this can be done there's

872
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:14,118
some of the cannabis that I've grown

873
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,838
and then I will leave it for questions

874
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:43,000
all right there you go fungus yes ma'am

875
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:47,030
in the wild and bring it to your garden

876
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,130
I will just take that and kind of mix it

877
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,440
into the top so I'll go out into the

878
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,480
mother nature you find like I was shown

879
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,000
in the photo you find that mycelium

880
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,619
carpet you take a look but you know the

881
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,119
averages you take no more than 10%

882
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:00,200
that's where you're not really stealing

883
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,420
from mother nature and you're just

884
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,009
improving your own grow back home so

885
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,930
I'll take that and then I'll just

886
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,270
drizzle it on the top if it's a newer

887
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:10,639
pot and I complain a clone or something

888
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:14,538
like that I'll drizzle it in the in that

889
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:17,960
area as well on your soil zone you were

890
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:20,780
using soil do you how long do you go

891
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,880
between changing out the old 35 50

892
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,980
gallon pot you just keep adding to it I

893
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,599
just keep adding to it keep adding to it

894
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,028
how long does that go for yours

895
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:31,789
as far as I know I would love to pass it

896
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:33,920
on to my son he's three years old so my

897
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:36,380
goal is to if there is a problem I just

898
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,119
continue to feed with compost compost

899
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,608
teas that's really where you're going to

900
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:43,789
get it all of the magic that is in the

901
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:47,598
rhizosphere is by focusing on high

902
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:49,730
quality inputs focusing on biodiversity

903
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,950
so I'm going to use a compost from cow

904
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:54,380
I'm going to use a compost from Buffalo

905
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:56,389
I'm gonna use a compost from fish that

906
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:00,130
way I get that full biodiversity and

907
00:37:56,389 --> 00:38:00,129
then I get that full genetic profile

908
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:12,848
we use calcium separate from cal-mag yes

909
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:16,538
ma'am so I like to foil or feed with

910
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:18,700
epson salt for the magnesium and I like

911
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:21,400
to add like oyster shell flour and those

912
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:23,649
kind of things even what we can get into

913
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,619
after this I could I could speak to you

914
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,329
on like Colorado natural farming we were

915
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:29,829
making ferments where we're using bone

916
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:32,079
and that kind of thing and breaking that

917
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,999
down with rice vinegar and that kind of

918
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,829
stuff and adding that as a calcium

919
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:37,629
source so there's a lot other ways to

920
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:42,729
add calcium than just here's a typical

921
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:44,259
cal-mag you mentioned earlier with the

922
00:38:42,728 --> 00:38:46,478
molasses or something going into the

923
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:47,889
compost teas you were saying not at the

924
00:38:46,478 --> 00:38:49,419
end does that mean you just added at the

925
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:51,068
beginning or you're adding less I

926
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,269
mentioned like the shotgun approach is

927
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:55,150
that part of that or is that something

928
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:57,458
else entirely yeah well it is part of

929
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,999
the shotgun approach when I found is

930
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:03,219
through dr. Elaine hams research is that

931
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:05,588
when you add it at the end the alphas

932
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:08,259
emerged because he just added another

933
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:09,248
huge food source so I like to try to

934
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:11,619
just keep it simple

935
00:39:09,248 --> 00:39:13,748
I'll just use a compost tea and then I

936
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:16,390
will maybe add a little bit of sugar

937
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:18,578
water after I fed that but I don't put

938
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:20,409
it into the tea itself and I encourage

939
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:21,729
you guys to experiment with the teas

940
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:23,318
that you're making because if your tea

941
00:39:21,728 --> 00:39:25,389
if your brewing a tea outside of your

942
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:28,119
room you're brewing totally different

943
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:31,239
microbes like 70 degrees than if you're

944
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,130
brewing them at 75 right so you have to

945
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,869
in your environment you have to do the

946
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,358
research and the due diligence on your

947
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:39,519
own to find out which temperature you

948
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:42,518
should be brewing these teas at and then

949
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:45,218
implement them the easiest way I've seen

950
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:50,659
is to brew the tea within the the grow

951
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:53,960
room itself a great presentation

952
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:55,759
you're doing I did want to speak on a

953
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,559
common misconception about the yields

954
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,750
and living soils I've been doing them

955
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,150
for quite a while two or three years on

956
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,099
a personal level and he just scaled up

957
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,579
on the commercial scale and what we're

958
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:09,529
finding is that a lot of folks are under

959
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:12,529
this common misconception that a living

960
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:15,100
soil or water only or a minimum input

961
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:18,830
style cultivation equates to immediately

962
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,969
reduced yield well we're just finding

963
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:22,219
that that's simply not the case

964
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:24,259
we're pulling two and a half pounds of

965
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:27,379
light on first cycle crops that aren't

966
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:31,100
even really truly living yet off of a

967
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:33,079
700 watt LED fixture so so the the yield

968
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,730
potential is still there and I think

969
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,559
moving forward and educating people in

970
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:38,389
living soils we really need to kind of

971
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,009
illustrate that there are people out

972
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:42,409
there that are hitting these numbers

973
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:45,140
that synthetic guys are getting but

974
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:47,539
literally just fresh water absolutely

975
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:49,519
and you're ahead of the game I mean I

976
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:50,960
can just kind of be honest I can look at

977
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,940
you and tell you're probably a fantastic

978
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,130
grower yeah you know you just have that

979
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,800
look but so he's probably more the

980
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,039
exception to the norm if you are a newer

981
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,210
grower it does take a little while to

982
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:03,829
understand soil food web if you have

983
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,480
been growing for a long time obviously

984
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:17,569
that learning curve is going to be a lot

985
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:18,769
shorter of your presentation certain

986
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,840
type of water what do you do to your

987
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:25,280
water for the living soil how do you

988
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:27,230
apply it so in the personal growth in my

989
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,390
own home grow I use it what's known as a

990
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:31,940
small boy and I make sure that I'm

991
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:34,039
focused on removing the chlorine but

992
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,780
also what's known as chloramine so

993
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:38,420
chloramine is what's really going to

994
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,670
kill your soil food web so I focus on

995
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,250
adding oxygen I have a big blue barrel

996
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,590
that I constantly am adding oxygen in to

997
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,989
make sure that I'm brewing away and

998
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,120
basically blasting off that chlorine and

999
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:52,549
then I'm using that small boy filter

1000
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:55,009
with a charcoal filter to make sure that

1001
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,530
no that chlorine is going into my water

1002
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,720
source and then you know I like I was

1003
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,580
saying the red wigglers and the

1004
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:03,618
white spring tell mites and everything

1005
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:06,559
that's working in and harmony with each

1006
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:08,570
other they will then regulate those pH

1007
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:12,559
levels so I don't worry about my water

1008
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:15,109
pH ever I don't worry about pH ever and

1009
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:17,449
I know a lot of that might sound foreign

1010
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:19,608
to you guys but in the synthetic world

1011
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:21,710
yes pH matters because you are forced

1012
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:23,690
feeding the plant a lot of the times

1013
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,820
when you when you're feeding the plant

1014
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:32,720
itself we've got time for one more

1015
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:34,519
question what are your thoughts on

1016
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:37,098
reverse osmosis water in living so I

1017
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:39,199
know recently within the past six months

1018
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:41,180
or a year I've been coming across some

1019
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:43,519
literature talking about how actually

1020
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:45,769
the the action of pushing the water

1021
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,239
through the membranes changes the

1022
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:50,150
structure of the water in such a way

1023
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:52,118
where it interacts negatively with with

1024
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,079
the nutrients and with that kind of

1025
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,150
exchange that happens in the rise of

1026
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,299
spirit if you come across any of that

1027
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,400
information in regards to not another

1028
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,480
detriment I dunno what you're speaking

1029
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,380
about and I'd love to talk to you about

1030
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,019
that more I just think that reverse

1031
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:11,420
osmosis water is lifeless and I'm trying

1032
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,429
to grow a life I want things to be alive

1033
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,650
and thriving and so especially in a

1034
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:18,219
commercial setting in my opinion is a

1035
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,220
waste of money

1036
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:30,550
exactly right on thank you Brian let's

1037
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:30,549
here for right all right
