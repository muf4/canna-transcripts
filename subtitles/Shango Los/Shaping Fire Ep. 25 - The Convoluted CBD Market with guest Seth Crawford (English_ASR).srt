2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:10,589
in the early days of medical cannabis

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,750
growers learned that a particular strain

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:14,730
they grew had more of medicinal value

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,100
than usual because of the feedback from

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,690
the people who smoked it a grower would

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,330
hear that it helps stop someone's

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,490
seizures or a decreased pain or maybe a

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,129
Parkinson's patients tremors subsided

10
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,169
for a while after enough comments like

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,948
that a grower knew that this particular

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,050
chemo var was one to keep around 2009

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,390
though the first publicly accessible

14
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,909
cannabis analytics labs began to open

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,280
and cannabis producers could for the

16
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,769
very first time ever get reliable

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,539
scientific potency testing and they

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,609
realize that many of these especially

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,079
medicinal strains contained

20
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:53,488
cannabidiol more commonly known as CBD

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,070
because there is no federally allowed

22
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,169
cannabis market in the US we now find

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,659
ourselves at a moment where CBD is sold

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,270
separately and differently in the for

25
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,188
existing markets of state regulated

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,490
medical state regulated recreational

27
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:10,408
adult use the unregulated market or

28
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,438
black market and the international

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,868
market for CBD isolate production and

30
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,000
distribution of CBD right now is wild

31
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,329
and volatile and the markets continue to

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
crash against each other as price

33
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:25,400
availability and quality between the

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,110
different markets continues to shift

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,118
anyone involved with cannabis business

36
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,310
or caring for patients will benefit from

37
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,368

38
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,079
fluctuations will affect them if you

consulted by lawmakers and policy

specialists for a better understanding

61
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,620
of how the underground cannabis economy

62
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,320

CBD market welcome to the show Seth

69
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:42,599
thanks so much for having me so Seth you

70
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:45,029
know until the research on CBD began to

71
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,710
be more readily available in media

72
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,099
everywhere you know there really wasn't

73
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,740
a CBD market at all but but now through

74
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,109
the efforts of hardcore CBD evangelists

75
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,360
like like Martin Lee and dr. Ethan Russo

76
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,340
and Kevin Jodrey and Lawrence Ringo and

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,970
you know lots of others including the

78
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:06,750
Sanjay Gupta TV special a profound

79
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:09,629
search for whole plant CBD is in the

80
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,370
hearts of patients everywhere when do

81
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,799
you think that we first began seeing

82
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,420
something that we could call the CBD

83
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,910
market it's a good question you can

84
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,259
almost look at it as something that has

85
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:25,039
organically emerged with the

86
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:29,519
availability of CBD rich plants I

87
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:31,829
listened in to the oral history with

88
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,770
Kevin Jodrey and it was absolutely

89
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,230
absolutely fantastic my personal

90
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,840
experience with the CBD market started

91
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,060
really with the availability of ac/dc

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,520
clones and so hearing that oral history

93
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,770
was really informative and it was need

94
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,959
to need to hear how it all ended up

95
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:54,719
forming a CDC in Oregon where I'm at

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,560
really became available after about 2013

97
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,900
that's when it kind of hit the scene and

98
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,670
that was the same year that industrial

99
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,360
hemp production took off in the state of

100
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,059
Colorado

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,190
now this occurred before the passage of

102
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,810
the 2014 federal farm bill which allowed

103
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:13,349
industrial hemp production in the United

104
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,500
States to happen the following year 2015

105
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:17,639
is when I would say the CBD market

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,589
really exploded

107
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,048
really took off just in the sense of

108
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:26,819
product actually being available for for

109
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,810
consumers that that just that plant

110
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:30,959
availability

111
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,180
seems to be the the big driver and as

112
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,789
you know obviously as we've seen as more

113
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,829
people get into the production side of

114
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,750
CBD it's become more available the price

115
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,789
has gone down and more and more people

116
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,230
are becoming exposed to it today yeah

117
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,660
that makes a lot of sense too because

118
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,210
you know it really is not the academic

119
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,410
papers or even you know it's to a

120
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:51,689
certain degree to the media attention

121
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,210
but the thing that's really driving the

122
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,500
CBD market from what I've seen is the

123
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,229
fact that people are actually getting

124
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,120
relief from it because someone will get

125
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:03,480
relief and then they'll tell their

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,639
sister and their sister-in-law and their

127
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,800
uncle and their kids and then suddenly

128
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,930
now you've got five more people who are

129
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,550
looking for CBD and then they tell

130
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,310
someone so you know we know that

131
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,470
referral is that is the best marketing

132
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,829
and when people get relief man they just

133
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,020
they want to talk about cannabinoids

134
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:25,139
they do they really do and the fact that

135
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,609
it's non psychoactive is you know it's

136
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,279
really a godsend I think for a lot of

137
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,919
people who are suffering and find some

138
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,929
relief from CBD and I know there's quite

139
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,668
a few people even in the still in the

140
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,850
medical marijuana community who don't

141
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:41,699
view CBD as something other than you

142
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,169
know a passing fad they view it as snake

143
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,418
oil because maybe they've tried it it

144
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:48,629
didn't work for them but when you see

145
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:52,199
the look on on a child's face or on a

146
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,819
grandparents face when they have some

147
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,829
sort of suffering relieved from it

148
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,219
whether it's drivet syndrome and

149
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:01,709
epileptic seizures and children or

150
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,830
osteoarthritis from age and just you

151
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:06,810
know long-term degeneration for for the

152
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:09,418
elder members of our communities it's

153
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,339
it's real and it strikes a pretty

154
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,469
powerful chord for those of us that are

155
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,810
participating in this this side and this

156
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,460
side of the cannabis market right on

157
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,870
so generally today we're going to be

158
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:24,569
focusing mostly on cannabidiol or CBD

159
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,668
but you know CBD is only one of over a

160
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:29,579
hundred cannabinoids that are in whole

161
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:31,709
plant cannabis and and and before we

162
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,839
move on I just want you to touch on you

163
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,939
know other emerging markets for

164
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:41,339
cannabinoids because you know I've seen

165
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:44,550
you know people marketing cbn CBG THC V

166
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:48,509
for appetite suppression are you seeing

167
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,240
the the the market for other

168
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:54,810
cannabinoids other than can have a dial

169
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,240
coming coming along as well they will be

170
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,978
yeah you know the thing about plant

171
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,530
breeding at least the way that we've

172
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:04,259
experienced it it takes about six months

173
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:06,769
to develop a new variety and that's when

174
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,120
you're really really making progress

175
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:11,490
we're lucky enough now to have a lot of

176
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,560
analytical labs on board we have PCR

177
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,970
screens that we can use with some folks

178
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,060
that are putting that stuff together for

179
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:21,000
us the the emergence of new cannabinoids

180
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,228
I think is going to accelerate now most

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,329
of them are not on the market at this

182
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:25,139
point but they will be in the next three

183
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:28,109
to five years

184
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,490
CBD was really the forerunner I think on

185
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,240
the the non-psychoactive cannabinoid

186
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:38,879
side it's really created a groundswell

187
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,530
and it had a in terms of just having as

188
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,779
we were talking about before having

189
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:45,779
people from a range of backgrounds and

190
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:48,689
ages and life experiences being more

191
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,788
open and accepting of a compound that's

192
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:53,339
coming from a cannabis plant simply

193
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:55,199
because it's non psychoactive it's I

194
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,929
think CBD has definitely paved the way

195
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,750
for for future inroads in that in that

196
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,840
department yeah yeah I buy that so you

197
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,720
know after that Sanjay Gupta special on

198
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,089
television that focused on the

199
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,430
wide-ranging uses of CBD you know lots

200
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:13,918
of folks like the Stanley Brothers in

201
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,538
Colorado you renamed hi-c be strange

202
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,639
that had they had come across and began

203
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:19,709
to market them aggressively and they

204
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,050
found a really warm welcome by both the

205
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,149
media and patients the the challenge

206
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,430
being of course that that the patient's

207
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:28,649
believed that it was only the Stanley

208
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,418
Brothers Charlotte's Web that was the

209
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:32,458
only strain that had health benefits and

210
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,990
that was certainly not the case and a

211
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,000
lot of people fault the Stanley Brothers

212
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,490
for their approach but it was was really

213
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,049
the media attention that they garnered

214
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,778
that helped explain the benefits of

215
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:44,579
whole plant CBD to everybody and got it

216
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:46,200
to reach middle America you know that's

217
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,870
when my family back in the Midwest

218
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,020
started talking to me about it was after

219
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,940
the Sanjay Gupta TV special so so to

220
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,909
what degree do you think

221
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,850
the heavy media coverage has led to that

222
00:08:56,909 --> 00:09:02,629
fast rise and the popularity of CBD oh

223
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,830
it could not be could not be overstated

224
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,110
you know that's the thing with just

225
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:11,250
about any type of idea or product though

226
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,600
is as soon as it's picked up and moved

227
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,509
into popular consciousness either by

228
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,409
media or today active social networks on

229
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:21,330
social media people moving ideas around

230
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:22,379
once it gains traction it definitely

231
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,350
takes off I mean there's some

232
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:28,500
fascinating research that looks at the

233
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:32,100
popularity of specific songs and whether

234
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,500
or not you know a popular popular tune

235
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,720
will catch on you know there's formulas

236
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,509
for crafting music that will sell

237
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,000
millions and millions of you know

238
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:43,769
records or whatever the same thing is

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,080
probably true when it comes to either

240
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:49,079
cannabis varieties or you know any other

241
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,720
idea it just comes down to being able to

242
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,139
get it out into the marketplace and have

243
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,070
people pick it up and that I understand

244
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,799
where you're going with the Stanley

245
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,690
Brothers and Sanjay Gupta it definitely

246
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,879
had a positive impact in terms of being

247
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,710
able to get the word out the dangers

248
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,450
with something like that when you have

249
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,370
one particular plant that gets

250
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,230
identified as as the be-all and end-all

251
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,629
is that you lose out on the amazing

252
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,960
diversity that is actually present in

253
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,759
the cannabis family yeah and it confused

254
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,340
a lot of people right because even

255
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,519
though it was wonderful to have people

256
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,080
talking about cannabis as a medicine

257
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,960
there was also you know a handful of

258
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:31,500
misinformation mixed into the reporting

259
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,650
and so now folks like you and I and our

260
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,190
in our and our contemporaries have to go

261
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,230
and kind of help people unlearn the

262
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,420
first wave of information that came out

263
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,519
and helped them fine-tune it so that

264
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:47,759
people can get the the proper medicine

265
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,399
that's going to work for them yeah no no

266
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,679
kidding I mean the same thing is is true

267
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
I would say on the THC side as well

268
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,069
people go to a dispensary and they're

269
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,990
asking for something that's going to

270
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,120
make them uplifted it's going to have a

271
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,460
positive euphoric feeling for them or

272
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,470
give them pain release and you know the

273
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,950
thing that they've been taught is indica

274
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,230
and sativa so you know

275
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,450
a little bit more sophisticated version

276
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,310
is narrow leaf and broadleaf plants but

277
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,629
you know the reality is and you had even

278
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:18,489
Rousseau on a few weeks ago we know that

279
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:20,049
it's not just those things it's terpenes

280
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,440
and in our breeding program we've

281
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:25,779
noticed that in open pollinated f2

282
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,300
generations we can find every

283
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,610
combination of terpene in plant shape

284
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:33,009
imaginable if it's a if it's a properly

285
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,200
bred line you can find anything in those

286
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:36,939
so it's two different different small

287
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,910
things like that where were the folks

288
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:43,000
who are who are learning and doing it by

289
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:44,649
experience end up having to correct some

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,960
of that information as we go but you

291
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:50,620
know that's I think that's science right

292
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,509
good yes I also appreciate that you're

293
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,129
you're plugging some of my former shows

294
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,230
you've already plugged to in our

295
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:58,179
interview so I appreciated both that the

296
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,550
oral history of CBD with Kevin Jodrey

297
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:02,439
and and the two shows that I've done

298
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:03,639
with dr. Rietz and Rousseau so I'm glad

299
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,760
that I'm glad that you've had a chance

300
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,319
to listen to the show too definitely and

301
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,289
these are these are good people doing

302
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,629
great work it's a very small community I

303
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,370
think of people who are really out on

304
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:17,309
the forefront of this and it's it's neat

305
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,230
to be a part of you know the the

306
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,879
misinformation about CVD that we were

307
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,700
talking about just a moment ago you know

308
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:28,090
I think that's what has led us to a lot

309
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,129
of these CVD only medical marijuana laws

310
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:34,000
at states because anybody you know these

311
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:35,919
legislators who are a little pushing for

312
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,039
CVD only laws because they don't want to

313
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,079
involve evil THC they just start missing

314
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,149
the point they don't understand the

315
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,280
importance of the entourage effect and

316
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:47,860
that you really need all of the

317
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,649
different cannabinoids in the plant to

318
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,690
you know creates the best medicine and

319
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,120
secondarily a lot of people especially

320
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,400
cancer patients and others it's the THC

321
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,220
part of the plant that is healing for

322
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,049
them I mean CBD is super healing and can

323
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,330
be used by every human because we all

324
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:06,519
have endocannabinoid systems but really

325
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,500
depending on what your issue is it may

326
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,389
be the THC that part of it that's the

327
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,149
medicine for you and I think a lot of

328
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,799
those legislators miss that it's a

329
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:16,600
hundred percent and you know one of the

330
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,899
issues that you I think is probably

331
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,420
contributing to that is

332
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,948
the piecemeal approach from state to

333
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,769
state with different type of

334
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:27,359
legalization frameworks what what I've

335
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,610
seen is a lot of the more conservative

336
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,550
states particularly in the south end up

337
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,959
passing the CBD only laws and their I I

338
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:37,078
don't want to say they're they're

339
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:39,748
totally misguided but I think they're

340
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:42,269
pushed in a particular way by people who

341
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:45,959
have vested interests in the production

342
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:47,549
side and who are trying to develop drugs

343
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,688
that would fit whatever you know laws

344
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:50,778
they come up with in those places

345
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:54,899
there's certain certain laws

346
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:57,958
they call them CBD CBD only laws but you

347
00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:01,860
can have up to five percent THC in in

348
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,659
your extracts and compounds to me that's

349
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,629
not a CBD only law that would be more

350
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:08,129
like a one to one law which is great and

351
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,959
like you mentioned that's probably one

352
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:11,759
of the more efficacious medical

353
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:15,708
applications is the synergy that's

354
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,928
involved between THC and CBD in the body

355
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:22,409
but it's led to a very very interesting

356
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:23,970
patchwork of legislation across the

357
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:26,009
country that in some cases makes good

358
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,490
sense and provides access and in other

359
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:31,169
cases just is bewildering yeah and and

360
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,459
since we're talking about the CBD market

361
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:35,519
today I think it's important to point

362
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:38,159
out that that that patchwork of laws has

363
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,990
made a really weird market where we're

364
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,259
at least two things are happening the

365
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,120
first thing is is that the patients are

366
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:47,428
are leaving their state and going to

367
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,249
another state either either temporarily

368
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,958
to just make a purchase or permanently

369
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:55,110
so they can have a long-term supply of

370
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,789
whatever part of the cannabis plant that

371
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,230
they need that's not available or in

372
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:01,620
their state so that's number one and

373
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:04,048
number two the simple arbitrage where

374
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,850
people are going to another state you

375
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:09,178
know buying thousands of dollars of

376
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,308
whatever specific medicine is needed in

377
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:13,318
their locale and then bringing it back

378
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:16,308
and then distributing it amongst their

379
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:20,278
friends and family you know if if we had

380
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:23,909
saying national cannabis medicine law

381
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:25,379
then this kind of arbitrage and and you

382
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:27,058
know cherry-picking where you were going

383
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,220
to purchase from state to state which is

384
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:30,600
not that happening I mean this is this

385
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,100
is not people trying to be criminals

386
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,399
this is people trying to work around a

387
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,000
nun

388
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,230
workable law 100% yeah and it's a what

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,899
you're saying to is highlighting just

390
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,460
the overall legal landscape in the

391
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,620
United States it's to me it's

392
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,200
fascinating we can basically divide it

393
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,480
into you look at it as a tripartite

394
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,220
division between in terms of

395
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,500
legalization going forward in the United

396
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,540
States right now on on one component you

397
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,789
have medical and recreational laws or

398
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,860
CBD only laws that are either passed

399
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:02,189
through citizens initiatives and states

400
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,360
or by state legislatures you have large

401
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,340
pharmaceutical companies who are

402
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,370
pursuing fda-approved

403
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,490
cannabinoid drugs for very specific

404
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,710
conditions and then you have industrial

405
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,389
hemp which is a federally legal and the

406
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,070
products that come out of industrial

407
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:19,409
hemp programs can be shipped to any

408
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,240
state legally in the United States and

409
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:22,589
there's a lot of in addition to the

410
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,909
cannabinoid research that's going on is

411
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:27,509
that there's a lot of agronomic research

412
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:29,819
as well and having those three three

413
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,129
totally separate divisions that are all

414
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,770
operating simultaneously with different

415
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:37,230
restrictions and different barriers to

416
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,779
entry for both people who are in that

417
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,570
marketplace or trying to consume

418
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:45,299
products from those marketplaces it's

419
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,580
just created a it's created all kinds of

420
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:50,069
issues well at the same time providing

421
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,080
you know just enough gray area I think

422
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,110
for a lot of people to move forward with

423
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,730
some pretty interesting work and you

424
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,620
know it gets even more messy because of

425
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,539
the lexicon is so messy I mean a

426
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,679
people's usage right I mean you know a

427
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,019
lot of people argue back and forth

428
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,000
between using the word marijuana which

429
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:08,069
has got a sordid history versus using

430
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,500
the word cannabis which is more accurate

431
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,659
and scientific but but even beyond that

432
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,490
you've got people who are in industrial

433
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,839
hemp who like to call their product

434
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,549
cannabis because technically it's

435
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,708
cannabis sativa and then you've got

436
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,349
people who are in medical marijuana

437
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,269
which is also cannabis sativa who want

438
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:26,458
to also use the word hemp because maybe

439
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:28,680
they were you know grow hemp for victory

440
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,570
people back in the day and so the

441
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,330
industry itself doesn't even have a

442
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:35,490
stable lexicon where people who are in

443
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:37,589
what what you and I would probably see

444
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,470
as different product categories using

445
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:42,389
each other's vocabulary which which not

446
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,819
only makes it more confusing for

447
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,590
investors but just totally loses

448
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:49,278
patience

449
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:52,069
yeah and the legal definitions do

450
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,990
exactly the same thing 100% agree with

451
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:58,009
you you look at the federal guidelines

452
00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:01,278
and marijuana quote-unquote is you need

453
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:04,639
type of cannabis that contains THC over

454
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:06,259
0.3% by way that's the definition that's

455
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:08,119
used anything else is considered

456
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:10,700
industrial hemp when will you step back

457
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:14,028
it's all of it is cannabis it's all part

458
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,830
of the same larger family and all of

459
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:17,298
these divisions that we've put in front

460
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,589
of us whether it's from a marketing

461
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:20,749
perspective or from a legal perspective

462
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:23,569
or all social constructs I mean the

463
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:25,190
blood the plants are the same same way

464
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,628
that we've created you know I think

465
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,389
about it from a from a social science

466
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:34,398
perspective race is probably the best

467
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:36,740
example of it we have no no real genetic

468
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:38,569
difference not a meaningful difference

469
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,259
between the racial categories that have

470
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:44,689
been constructed over the years if you

471
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:47,450
take one person and analyze their genome

472
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,159
from one particular race that they've

473
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,220
been assigned to and you compare it to

474
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:53,960
another person from a different race you

475
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,118
will end up with more similarities than

476
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,798
you would get if you had taken two

477
00:18:56,118 --> 00:19:00,949
people from the same race and analyzed

478
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:01,638
their genomes same thing is true with

479
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,679
cannabis

480
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:06,109
these are socially constructed

481
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,269
boundaries that are that are basically

482
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:11,048
vestiges of 20th century prohibition

483
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:14,749
mentality so now that we've established

484
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:17,359
pretty thoroughly that there is a CVD

485
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:21,950
market and that it's growing really

486
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:24,378
quickly and and including both the

487
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:28,940
licensed cannabis market or medical

488
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:31,189
marijuana market and and and if you if

489
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,919
you know this the gray market what would

490
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,320
would you calculate the total size of

491
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,590
the CBD market to be in the United

492
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,970
States you know honestly and this is

493
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:43,220
weird I mean this is my area of

494
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,659
expertise but I have no idea and I think

495
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,909
that that would be the honest answer

496
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:49,519
that anyone anyone who's looking at this

497
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:52,278
seriously would would tell you I know

498
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,399
that it has dramatically expanded in the

499
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:58,940
last two years in particular and a lot

500
00:19:55,398 --> 00:20:01,159
of the high CBD the hemp or

501
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,240
CBD flowers that are being produced in

502
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,400
the United States at least under the

503
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,500
industrial hemp program get exported to

504
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,750
other countries Israel is a very large

505
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,750
buyer there are a lot of people in a lot

506
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,029
of companies in Europe that are creating

507
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:16,220
basically using high CBD flowers as an

508
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:18,319
alternative to tobacco for a smoking

509
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:22,220
cessation there at least to nicotine

510
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:23,929
cessation it's it's large and like we

511
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,360
talked about earlier I think the more

512
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:29,060
that's available the more if you can end

513
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:30,949
up seeing produced because the demand is

514
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:33,369
actually there you know I did this back

515
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,630
of the envelope calculation last year as

516
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:37,909
some legislation was going through the

517
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,620
going through the Oregon Legislature

518
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,240
that was going to be changing some

519
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:43,939
aspects of the industrial hemp program

520
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,609
here and the number that I came up with

521
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,000
was specifically for horses for aged

522
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:52,159
horses old horses with arthritis because

523
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,440
one of the cool things that has been

524
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,060
demonstrated with CBD is that it not

525
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,799
only helps people but it also helps

526
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:01,339
animals as well specifically with

527
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:04,609
age-related degeneration arthritic

528
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:07,220
horses are large animals that would

529
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:09,139
require a lot of CBD but you know it's

530
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,630
basically sixteen thousand acres worth

531
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,330
to be able to treat all of the horses in

532
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,250
the United States that's horses I mean

533
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:17,750
there's other animals too and and people

534
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,509
could probably benefit from it as well

535
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,849
and at this point we're getting close to

536
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:25,970
having that many acres lashes we're this

537
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:28,250
year we will be over it nationally I

538
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,600
think the state of Kentucky has 14,000

539
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,309
acres licensed I know the state of

540
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,359
Oregon has 3,000 acres licensed this

541
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:38,000
year it's it is getting very large now

542
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,279
compared to the THC market overall in

543
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,079
the United States it's still smaller in

544
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:45,049
terms of total total amount demanded

545
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,819
total amount produced but I think I

546
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,220
think we're going to see a change in

547
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:50,899
that definitely within the next ten

548
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,559
years yeah isn't that an interesting

549
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:58,009
aspect of this right I mean CBD

550
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:02,389
availability is low and the demand for

551
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:04,640
it is is on a wicked rise and yet nearly

552
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,200
all of the licensed

553
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,500
Cannabis producers in the united states

554
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,590
emphasize high THC strains as their

555
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:17,299
flagship products but the th the price

556
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:18,740
of THC is crashing and CBD you know CBD

557
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,529
is going down a little bit just because

558
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,230
it's not prohibited as much anymore but

559
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:26,779
really the demand is so high that you

560
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,170
can't even keep CBD on the shelves and

561
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:32,089
and yet because they think they want to

562
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,279
decrease their risk most licensed

563
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:37,099
producers are still focusing on THC

564
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:39,649
where if I had a license I'd be going

565
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:42,259
all-in on CBD because that market is

566
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,390
going to outpace any kind of price

567
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:48,500
decrease for years and years and years

568
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:51,710
to come to a certain extent I I agree

569
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,299
with you on that over the long term I

570
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,000
think in the short term at least the way

571
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:58,549
that we've seen it unfold in Washington

572
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,599
and Colorado in Oregon and I'm assuming

573
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:03,079
we'll see the same thing happen in

574
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:06,230
California with adult use legalization

575
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:08,659
comes a lot of restrictions a lot of

576
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,759
security requirements and a very very

577
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,259
high overhead in terms of barriers to

578
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,460
entry you have to have a you have to

579
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:16,430
have a lot of money to get into those

580
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:20,450
markets and the prices that we've seen

581
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:23,440
per pound on CBD rich flowers are still

582
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,970
there they're way below what ithc

583
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,009
Flowers command at this point so I think

584
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,079
in the short term it makes good business

585
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:31,549
sense to get into the THD market if

586
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,339
you're in a state legal recreational

587
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:36,769
program or adult use program on the

588
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:39,259
other hand and we've seen this bolt in

589
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:42,769
Colorado Washington and Oregon now the

590
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:43,700
the production for THC has typically

591
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:45,440
outpaced

592
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,259
the demand and so it makes it very

593
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,240
difficult for these farmers to actually

594
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:53,240
sell their product whereas with the CBD

595
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,309
side it tends to go pretty quickly you

596
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,799
know I think that's a really really good

597
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,629
insight and and I think I'll amend my

598
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,909
position a little bit based on what you

599
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:05,930
just said and I think that one of the

600
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:08,690
reasons why the price for CBD is not on

601
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:11,390
par as much with THC is because the

602
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,090
right CBD products have not necessarily

603
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,100
in the market yet you know a lot of

604
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,990
folks are taking CBD and you know

605
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:21,109
spiking them with flavorings or you

606
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:25,370
using CBD isolate in an edible or you

607
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:28,399
know so much of the recreational mindset

608
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:29,599
of the products is not bringing products

609
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,900
to the market that are actually is

610
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:34,549
actually CBD for patients and I think

611
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,380
that as product designers get more

612
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:40,129
sophisticated and understand patients

613
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,440
more the demand will increase I see that

614
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,240
happening for sure yeah well let's go

615
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,679
ahead and take our first short break and

616
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,269
be right back you are listening to

617
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,440
shaping fire and my guest today is

618
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:52,549
cannabis policy analyst Seth Crawford

619
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,259
we humans are attracted to plants

620
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,359
because they offer us relief and are a

621
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,429
whole lot of fun sometimes though the

622
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:00,529
best parts are buried inside the plant

623
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:02,900
and we need to use specialty extraction

624
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:04,910
technology when it comes to cannabis it

625
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,100
is extraordinarily important to extract

626
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,380
its precious oils without changing them

627
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:11,480
in the process we want to preserve the

628
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,370
properties of the cannabinoids terpenes

629
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,240
and other constituents that all work

630
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:18,919
together since 1994 Eden labs has been

631
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,220
developing extraction technology and

632
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,170
processes to do just that Eden labs was

633
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,670
founded by a cannabis loving engineer

634
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,340
during the early days of medical

635
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,320
marijuana in California and the expanded

636
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:32,269
Eden team has been designing and

637
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,039
building industry-leading solutions for

638
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:37,160
cannabis extraction ever since

639
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,950
Eden labs flagship product is the newly

640
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,080
improved high flow co2 extractor as

641
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,299
other extraction companies enter the

642
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,159
market it is the high flow from Eden

643
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:48,409
labs that everyone chases and tries to

644
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,090
compare themselves with not only that

645
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,730
but the improved automation software

646
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:55,909
allows data to be collected stored and

647
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,130
studied Eden labs can outfit your whole

648
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,380
lab Eden's coldfinger

649
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,929
ethanol extractor creates astonishing

650
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:05,300
whole plant extracts working alone or in

651
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:07,610
tandem with an initial stream distilling

652
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,200
step to isolate monoterpenes before

653
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:11,839
extracting the rest of the botanical

654
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,690
constituents Eden offers you many

655
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,669
options including vacuum distillation

656
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:19,850
column distilling stirred reactor units

657
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:22,519
and accelerated solvent recovery when

658
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:24,529
you partner with Eden labs your lab team

659
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,329
is enrolled into the ena labs training

660
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:28,369
program to boost their understanding of

661
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:30,349
Eden's best practices to ensure that

662

more

684
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,799
now that the health benefits of terpenes

685
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,899
have become well known in the cannabis

686
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,400
industry people everywhere are looking

687
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,380
for the purest terpenes without

688
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,970
adulterants the problem with most

689
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,010
chirping providers is that they're not

690
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,529
sourced naturally and instead are made

691
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:39,019
as a byproduct of refining petroleum and

692
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:40,639
that's so sketchy the terpenes sold by

693
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:43,759
true terpenes are entirely different

694
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,440
they are certified organic non-gmo and

695
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,109
food grade that means that they are

696
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,940
extracted from real plant sources there

697
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:52,099
are no solvents of any kind they are

698
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,429
distilled only with steam that's right

699
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:57,109
only steam in fact terpenes from true

700
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:59,390
drippings are so pure that you can eat

701
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,699
them not only that but you can stack

702
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,799
them with better results - what I mean

703
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,929
is other company's turbines have got a

704
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:07,849
few percent of impurities and when you

705
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:10,100
stack those terpenes to make your blend

706
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:12,529
you're adding a variety of impurities

707
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,939
that degrade your final product true

708
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:16,308
terpenes also have strain-specific

709
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,470

00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:14,720
listening to shaping fire I'm your host

735
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:18,079
Shango Lowe and I guess this week is

736
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,160
cannabis policy analyst Seth Crawford so

737
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,589
during the first break

738
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,419
excuse me during the first set we talked

739
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:25,548
pretty much exclusively about the size

740
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:27,559
of the market and how it's just going to

741
00:29:25,548 --> 00:29:29,900
get bigger and bigger from for all the

742
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,928
cannabinoids and cannabis but at the

743
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:35,419
moment specifically CBD and

744
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:38,620
interestingly because of federal

745
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:43,270
prohibition there are some states where

746
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:47,149
you're not able to get legal whole plant

747
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:48,798
CBD and and so what we're seeing in the

748
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:53,509
market is a lot of folks have started

749
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:58,250
extracting the single molecule of CBD

750
00:29:53,509 --> 00:30:01,129
out of industrial hemp plants which are

751
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,589
not only increasingly legal in the

752
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:07,640
United States but also you can buy the

753
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:10,279
single molecule CBD you know overseas

754
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,350
and then people can put them into

755
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:14,678
whatever the product they're making and

756
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:17,740
you know there's there's become a lot of

757
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:21,380
infighting between the CBD from hemp

758
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:24,890
people and the CBD from whole plant

759
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:28,160
cannabis folks so let's start with you

760
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:34,490
know Sepp how big has the CBD from hemp

761
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:36,440
market become a big big and I think part

762
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:41,419
of that is driven you know as you just

763
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,279
described folks importing either isolate

764
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:46,220
krystal krystal and isolate from

765
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,168
European countries or from China we're

766
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,610
importing actual industrial hemp flowers

767
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,950
and then doing the extraction here in

768
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:54,049
the United States which is again

769
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,779
federally legal under the farm bill and

770
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:57,849
that one actually goes back to 2004 that

771
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:59,798
was the ninth

772
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:01,899
a Court of Appeals decision with the

773
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:04,298
hemp industry Association versus the DEA

774
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:07,140
that allowed for the importation of

775
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:11,650
industrial hemp but Lia seed products

776
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:15,130
flowers fiber etc from from other

777
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:19,509
countries so long as it met that 0.3

778
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:21,370
percent THC threshold for folks who

779
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:25,419
aren't very familiar with what we're

780
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:29,019
talking about about the CBD whole plant

781
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:30,788
CBD from medical plants versus extracted

782
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:32,589
from industrial hemp would you go ahead

783
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:35,140
and just give a nice little summary of

784
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:38,349
that for folks yeah industrial hemp

785
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,700
traditionally was you know we know the

786
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:41,558
history of it in the United States it

787
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:46,419
was basically made illegal along with

788
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:49,529
all other cannabis the European Union

789
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:52,330
today and individual European countries

790
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:54,879
previously had allowed industrial hemp

791
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:57,579
production and different different

792
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,400
requirements on THC ranging from 0.2

793
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:02,619
percent up to 0.3 percent were allowed

794
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,788
in those countries and over the last 20

795
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:07,239
years they developed a number of

796
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:09,730
different varieties that that meet those

797
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,470
requirements but to meet those

798
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,419
requirements from a plant breeding

799
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,150
perspective the easiest way to do it is

800
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:17,440
to just shut off the THC production so

801
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,419
if you'd like to grow cannabis on an

802
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,419
industrial scale you have to have plants

803
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:25,659
that have the THC synthesis essentially

804
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:29,169
turned off it active alleles what

805
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:31,210
normally happens in a in a in a any

806
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:33,759
cannabis plant if the THC side is turned

807
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,819
off the opposite side is essentially the

808
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:39,640
CBD production side so these European

809
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:41,168
breeders were by accident not

810
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,169
necessarily understanding what they were

811
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:45,788
doing they were creating CBD cultivars

812
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:48,730
that were then being used in production

813
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:50,558
now the problem with that is that to

814
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,558
obtain the 0.2 percent or the 0.3

815
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:56,109
percent THC also requires that your

816
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:59,139
total cannabinoid content be very very

817
00:32:56,109 --> 00:33:02,349
low and there's a lot of overlap between

818
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,270
total oil production with terpenes and

819
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:06,548
cannabinoids so those two things are

820
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:09,668
definitely linked together so what you

821
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:11,740
end up with is cannabis plants that come

822
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:13,960
in at say 2% CBD or

823
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:17,440
I know there are some cultivars now up

824
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,409
to five percent CBD in Europe but what

825
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,120
they lack are terpenes and we know about

826
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:25,360
the synergistic relationship between

827
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:27,699
terpenes and cannabinoids it's a very

828
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:31,469
important distinction so on the one hand

829
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:34,750
we have very cheap massive-scale

830
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,548
flowers that have been seeded and you

831
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:38,819
know grown in hundreds and hundreds of

832
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:41,079
acres and then mechanically harvested

833
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:43,689
compressed and shipped over to the

834
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:45,849
United States for extraction that's

835
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,350
going into the CBD isolytic market and

836
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:50,829
then you have other folks who've

837
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:53,829
realized that you know we can we can

838
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:56,889
actually make high CBD plants that are

839
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:59,168
also turkey enriched and that sort of

840
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,990
been a renaissance in inbreeding in the

841
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:04,028
United States and that very happy to be

842
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:06,159
here in the u.s. at this point because I

843
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:07,960
feel like we are definitely definitely

844
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,990
leading the world in regards to that

845
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,059
approach right on and for and for folks

846
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:15,418
who this information is new to you I

847
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:18,940
recommend that you go back and listen to

848
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:22,868
the episode about oh I don't know about

849
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:25,780
eight weeks ago with dr. Ethan Rousseau

850
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:29,230
where we go through his historically

851
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:31,510
significant paper taming THC where he

852
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,760
talks about the different components in

853
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,700
medical cannabis and how each one of

854
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,460
them is important from CBD and THC like

855
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:42,878
we're talking about today but also the

856
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:45,039
terpenes the flavonoids even the lipids

857
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,769
and the chlorophyll for some patients

858
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,918
and it's how all of these different

859
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:52,449
constituents work together versus the

860
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:55,088
other option which we're also talking

861
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:57,909
about the CBD from hemp where they're

862
00:34:55,088 --> 00:35:00,190
using extraction processes to to just

863
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:02,409
pull out the CBD molecule and make it

864
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:07,059
into an isolate and then put that into a

865
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:10,809
into a product so it's interesting when

866
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:13,989
you say Seth that to see the folks who

867
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:16,989
are buying CBD from hemp without

868
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:18,429
understanding the entourage effect be

869
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,739
surprised when they don't necessarily

870
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:25,059
get the medical benefits that they were

871
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:25,739
hoping for it's true yeah and you can

872
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:27,119
actually see it

873
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:29,189
selected in the marketplace at this

874
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,039
point as well it's very funny timing I

875
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,780
got some would call it internet spam but

876
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:36,090
I got an email this morning from someone

877
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,269
who was trying to push CBD isolate guy

878
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:42,180
just because I am working in that market

879
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:47,190
and the prices right now for CBD isolate

880
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:50,009
are half half of what the raw oil raw

881
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:52,440
co2 oil prices are in the United States

882
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,450
and I'm convinced that it's because

883
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,639
people are realizing that the isolate

884
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:58,559
just doesn't work as well for for most

885
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,599
conditions not going to say all but for

886
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,340
most conditions as you actually need to

887
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,309
have what people refer to as the

888
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,800
botanical drug substance the BDS the

889
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:10,019
full whole plant extract that contains

890
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,789
both the terpenes major cannabinoids but

891
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:13,380
then also the minor cannabinoids as well

892
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:16,289
those seem to be playing an interesting

893
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,780
role that people are working to figure

894
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:21,570
out at this point but it's sort of at

895
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,340
the nascent stages yeah yeah yeah I

896
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,769
think that it's interesting because you

897
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:30,510
know the folks who are selling CBD

898
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:32,789
isolate as a cure-all they refer to all

899
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,350
of the great things that CBD can do and

900
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:37,739
they refer to the studies but the

901
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:40,259
studies are not using CBD isolate the

902
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:43,019
studies are always using CBD in the

903
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:46,080
presence of THC and other cannabinoids

904
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:47,429
and so they're they're referring to

905
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,250
these studies which are not actually

906
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:51,989
talking about isolate to support their

907
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,300
isolate which is which is a challenge

908
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:56,219
but you know they're marketing people

909
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,150
and they're trying to sell their CBD

910
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:02,459
isolate and and yet when it comes right

911
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,570
down to it it's it's it's not a product

912
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,030
that's going to get you where you want

913
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:08,309
to go so that's interesting I had not

914
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,830
realized that that the the wholesale

915
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:14,099
prices for isolate had had crashed so

916
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:20,429
much do you think that that there are

917
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:23,750
any good uses for CBD isolate I'm sure

918
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:26,489
there are I personally haven't found any

919
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:30,179
it's not something that has been very

920
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:31,739
effective but I will also say that from

921
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:35,639
my own personal experience at certain

922
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:38,459
certain cultivars of CBD rich cannabis

923
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:39,389
plants don't work very well either it's

924
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,349
it's really

925
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:42,808
about finding something that works

926
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:46,528
really really well for your particular

927
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:48,059
condition and unfortunately a lot of

928
00:37:46,528 --> 00:37:51,929
this is still clouded in mystery and

929
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:54,210
just in part because you know the plants

930
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:56,429
change environmental conditions change

931
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:59,190
the overall composition even if you're

932
00:37:56,429 --> 00:38:00,929
working with a clone and realistically I

933
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:03,119
don't think the analytical capabilities

934
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:05,190
of many of the labs are on par with what

935
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,568
we need to be able to identify all of

936
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,159
the substances that are actually

937
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:11,009
medically useful for particular

938
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,389
conditions amen you know where we have

939
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,250
problems all the way down the line right

940
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:17,129
we've got labs that need to get more

941
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:20,250
complex we need more research in it and

942
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,710
also each plant has got its variables

943
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:24,568
and each human has their own variables

944
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,028
so we're talking about highly

945
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:30,119
personalized medicine here which needs a

946
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:33,420
lot more research you know I talked

947
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:35,818
about not being a fan of CBD isolate

948
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,528
from hemp when when I'm doing public

949
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:39,989
speaking and I always get somebody who

950
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:41,849
wants to argue with me and and and I

951
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:44,939
have to be open to two possible

952
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:48,539
applications of CBD isolate which can be

953
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:51,349
helpful to patients one is that it seems

954
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:54,539
that CBD isolate it tends to work with

955
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:58,079
for some people with eczema and

956
00:38:54,539 --> 00:39:00,000
psoriasis topically I've got patients

957
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,818
that I've talked to who they aren't

958
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,949
taking any other form of whole plant

959
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:07,199
cannabinoid or THC or anything they're

960
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:09,389
just using that topically and they've

961
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,159
gotten some good anecdotal results so

962
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:14,838
I'm open to that being a possibility and

963
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:18,268
also patients who can't afford as much

964
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:21,268
cannabidiol as they need they may be

965
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:24,298
taking a like a whole plant tincture and

966
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:25,979
also may be smoking some and so they're

967
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:27,869
getting all this whole plants so they're

968
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,809
getting a wide variety of cannabinoids

969
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:33,480
but then they're also taking some CBD

970
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:35,278
isolate to kind of spike how much CBD

971
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,818
they're getting each day each day and

972
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:40,858
that you know spiking in in the

973
00:39:38,818 --> 00:39:42,989
environment of all this other whole

974
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:45,929
plant I kind of got to be open to that

975
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:48,868
potentially being you know offering some

976
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:51,210
benefit to I think yeah yeah definitely

977
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:53,420
but again it's for most of these things

978
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,519
that's you're dealing with the entre

979
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,130
effect and in a case with psoriasis

980
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,619
psoriasis and eczema you're dealing with

981
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,358
a whole new set of cannabinoid receptors

982
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,789
that have not been investigated properly

983
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,670
that happened to exist in her dermal

984
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:10,460
layer so again it's just all kinds of

985
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:13,760
every time we uncover something new

986
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,409
it raises 50 new questions and that's

987
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,660
the beauty of being sort of out on the

988
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:20,239
out on the outskirts of something new

989
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:22,098
and fun and if it's hard that patients

990
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,259
need to be so flexible at this point and

991
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:26,720
also be doing so much research right

992
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:30,349
because when you're a patient you may

993
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:32,179
not have a lot of money you may not have

994
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:34,940
the wherewithal to be doing all this

995
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:37,940
research and yet the cure that you need

996
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,740
if somewhere in all of this all these

997
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,900
data points and all this education that

998
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:43,879
it has to happen and so I come across

999
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,710
folks who have spent hundreds of dollars

1000
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,420
on the wrong products and then they get

1001
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,548
frustrated and then they go back to

1002
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,210
their pharmaceuticals or you know it's

1003
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:55,039
just it it's so frustrating to see the

1004
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:58,639
people who are at most risk in our

1005
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,889
society not being able to get clean

1006
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,659
information because in some instances

1007
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:04,879
the plants aren't developed and in other

1008
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:07,250
instances the research hasn't been done

1009
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,420
and so there's so much anecdotal

1010
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,809
information that people are making

1011
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,730
serious buying decisions based on

1012
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:16,160
totally totally it's it's a problem and

1013
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,170
you know it's it's both a problem and a

1014
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,149
blessing and a curse

1015
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,309
it's difficult for people to get good

1016
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,780
information and to have I'd say a

1017
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,790
consistent treatment regimen for

1018
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,000
whatever it is that they also definitely

1019
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:30,739
an issue and the normal answer in the

1020
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,880
United States and in other countries to

1021
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:34,279
deal with that is to go to the

1022
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,798
pharmaceutical route and in the United

1023
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,359
States you know the FDA drug approval

1024
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:40,548
process is one that is incredibly

1025
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:43,969
reductionist it's sort of the worst

1026
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:46,849
aspects of the 20th century ideas about

1027
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:50,750
science and in methods that you can

1028
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:53,088
possibly dream up and cannabis is by its

1029
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,250
very nature in its internal synergy in

1030
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:57,650
the way that it works with with people

1031
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,239
it ends up challenging that that very

1032
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,608
reductionist approach which means that

1033
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:03,348
it's incredibly difficult for a large

1034
00:42:01,608 --> 00:42:06,889
pharmaceutical company to step in and

1035
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:07,610
come up with a particular formulation

1036
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:09,199
that

1037
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:11,480
can be replicated over and over and over

1038
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,819
and actually work that involves all of

1039
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,820
the compounds that you would find in in

1040
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:19,550
a whole whole plan to extract so both

1041
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,530
good in the sense that you know it's

1042
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,000
very complicated but also bad in the

1043
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,510
sense that it's it's really hard to nail

1044
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,309
down

1045
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,500
yeah well said so we're going to we're

1046
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:29,329
going to hit the pharmaceutical industry

1047
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:34,849
as a whole after the break but before

1048
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:37,819
the break I know you are a a scotch how

1049
00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:40,250
would I like say you're at a medicinal

1050
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,360
hemp breeder because what you breed is

1051
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,110
kind of different right you're taking

1052
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,550
you're taking medicinal strains and

1053
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:49,370
crossing them with traditionally

1054
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:53,630
industrial hemp to create this kind of

1055
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:55,880
you know hybrid that grows fast and

1056
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:59,210
close to each other but also has got

1057
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,619
great Terps and a high CBD percentage so

1058
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:05,380
what what do you what do you call what

1059
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:08,719
you grow oh man I'm just a farmer

1060
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:11,480
alright it's I would say that what we

1061
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,769
are doing and I it's not just us or

1062
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,519
there are others who are participating

1063
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:18,289
in this kind of craft Renaissance we're

1064
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:22,780
trying to create cannabinoid rich

1065
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:26,420
terpene rich plants that can be grown

1066
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,850
grown in it on an industrial scale and a

1067
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,159
lot of that is just being made possible

1068
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:34,069
under the farm bill with less

1069
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:35,750
restrictive canopy requirements and you

1070
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:38,030
know basically just a federal legal

1071
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,010
framework to operate under it allows us

1072
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,019
to you know at this point we have we're

1073
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:44,540
running a test field right now we have

1074
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:49,130
30,000 plants out there on four foot

1075
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:51,739
centers we can go through and identify

1076
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:53,300
the standout candidates that are really

1077
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:55,129
doing interesting things not only with

1078
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,289
the terpene profiles the cannabinoid

1079
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,750
profiles but also on the agronomic side

1080
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:04,099
we we're a breeding company that's

1081
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:06,079
trying to not only make oil-rich plants

1082
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:08,690
but also make those plants flower at the

1083
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,489
right time you know once you step

1084
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,769
outside of you know growing in a small

1085
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:14,599
space or in your backyard and you you

1086
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:16,309
apply industrial agricultural techniques

1087
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,170
and you know try to do it organically

1088
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:21,599
and responsibly as possible

1089
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,849
you run into a whole host of new issues

1090
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,619
so like I was mentioning before this is

1091
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:27,838
just one of those avenues within the

1092
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,720
legalization framework that that's

1093
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:33,298
coming out and what's what's really

1094
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,548
driving our work on the on the terpene

1095
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:37,619
and cannabinoids side is the demand as

1096
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:41,579
you were mentioning before the market is

1097
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:44,130
actually demanding terpene rich plants

1098
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:47,160
rather than these these these isolate

1099
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:52,410
compounds so I've got a really nerdy

1100
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:57,588
question for you so a lot of people take

1101
00:44:52,409 --> 00:45:01,108
a shot at CBD from hemp by saying that

1102
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:04,199
CBD from hemp is bad because there's so

1103
00:45:01,108 --> 00:45:07,980
little CBD in any particular industrial

1104
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:11,489
hemp plant that you have to extract from

1105
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,969
just acres and acres of plant material

1106
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:18,199
in order to get a viable amount of CBD

1107
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:22,169
for sale and that is dangerous because

1108
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:26,039
hemp is an exceptionally good heavy

1109
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:27,900
metal and toxin aggregator from the soil

1110
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:31,230
it just pulls it out of the soil which

1111
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:34,048
is why they use hemp to clean up the

1112
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:37,260
areas around toxic spills and such now

1113
00:45:34,048 --> 00:45:41,309
on the other side people are crowing

1114
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:44,010
about CBD from medical plants but at the

1115
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:50,309
end of the day they're both cannabis

1116
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:53,069
sativa and are in pull from the earth so

1117
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:57,119
is there a difference in the botany

1118
00:45:53,068 --> 00:46:00,230
between industrial hemp pulling up

1119
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,849
toxins out of the soil versus medical

1120
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:06,690
cannabis plants pulling toxins out of

1121
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:09,240
the soil if the toxins are there they

1122
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,559
will be bio accumulated what we have

1123
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:13,548
seen there's a really interesting paper

1124
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:16,829
that was put out as a white paper from

1125
00:46:13,548 --> 00:46:17,880
the Canada Safety Institute organization

1126
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:20,700
that was put together

1127
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,890
Mowgli homes with Philo's was one of the

1128
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:26,818
one of the originators of the group and

1129
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:29,190
they did some some work on heavy metal

1130
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:31,318
accumulation in cannabis plants and

1131
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,420
they're there of actual final analysis

1132
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:33,559
was that it's not

1133
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,470
something that we need to worry about

1134
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:39,349
I'm I'm it's something I'm very worried

1135
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:42,139
about I'm moving forward but I think

1136
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:45,829
it's less of a problem than just

1137
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:47,299
traditional agricultural pesticides one

1138
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:49,219
of the things that we've seen in Oregon

1139
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,960
and I do want to give Oregon just a

1140
00:46:49,219 --> 00:46:52,969
little bit of a little bit of a mention

1141
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,220
here because I think in some ways we are

1142
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:57,469
doing things very right on the from a

1143
00:46:55,219 --> 00:47:00,230
safety perspective with cannabis testing

1144
00:46:57,469 --> 00:47:02,509
testing of products we have some of the

1145
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,219
most rigorous pesticide screens in the

1146
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:06,700
world at this point for cannabis

1147
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:08,839
products and what we're finding is that

1148
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:11,269
even the people who are doing everything

1149
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,500
exactly right who did not spray anything

1150
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:14,509
on their plants who are operating

1151
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,780
biodynamically and organically and then

1152
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:22,300
just farming farming in a sustainable

1153
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:24,410
way they still end up getting

1154
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,240
contaminated and it's not because of

1155
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:29,239
anything they've done it's because of

1156
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:31,759
just how pervasive pesticides and

1157
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:34,629
herbicides are in the environment and

1158
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,130
widely used in in agricultural areas

1159
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,869
that I think is something to be very

1160
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,119
very concerned about and to be honest

1161
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:42,529
that's why you see so much of the

1162
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,869
industrial hemp from other countries

1163
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:47,560
getting turned into isolate it's because

1164
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:50,750
of contamination from from pesticides

1165
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:53,299
right on I'll buy that so let's go ahead

1166
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,889
and take our second break when we come

1167
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,600
back we're going to be talking about the

1168
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:59,929
opportunities in the pharmaceutical

1169
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,309
industry with CBD you are listening the

1170
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:05,210
shaping fire and my guest today is

1171
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:06,980
cannabis policy analyst Seth Crawford if

1172
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,960
you grow cannabis with sunshine you can

1173
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,820
often feel limited by the seasonal cycle

1174
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,740
you want to grow sustainably and save

1175
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,570
money so you use as little electricity

1176
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:16,309
as possible but if you haven't studied

1177
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:17,840
or implemented light deprivation

1178
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:19,940
techniques into your greenhouse you're

1179
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,440
leaving a lot of money on the table by

1180
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,150
incorporating light deprivation

1181
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,650
solutions into your greenhouse you can

1182
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,750
often add two or three additional

1183
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:28,340
growing cycles to your year when you

1184
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,260
pencil out the financial benefit of

1185
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,180
those additional cycles you'll realize

1186
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,130
why commercial scale light deprivation

1187
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:36,799
technology is remaking the cannabis

1188
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:38,690
industry what used to be done by pulling

1189
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,370
tarps over hoop houses has been scaled

1190
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:42,289
up over the last few years in such a way

1191
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:43,969
that it's become mechanized easy and

1192
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:46,019
affordable to even small-scale

1193
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:48,419
commercial cannabis operations

1194
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:50,280
forever flowering greenhouses is the

1195
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,170

1196
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,390
greenhouse design in operation for the

1197
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:56,220
commercial cannabis industry their team

1198
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,629
of greenhouse experts have been in the

1199
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:59,099
fields of Northern California for

1200
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,690
decades and they're now building

1201
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:03,599
greenhouses for commercial cannabis

1202
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:05,070
companies across the country if you are

1203

intelligent greenhouse management as

1209
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,650
well as the huge financial benefit of

1210
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,480
incorporating light depth techniques

1211
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:23,369
there are so many aspects of utilizing a

1212
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,170
greenhouse that can go wrong from

1213
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:27,119
temperature and airflow to light depth

1214

listening to shaping fire I'm your host

1263
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:28,210
Shanga 'lose and our guest this week is

1264
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:30,490
cannabis policy analyst Seth Crawford so

1265
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:33,548
so far we've talked about how huge the

1266
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:35,949
CBD market is and why it's important to

1267
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:37,480
know your source and that of course is

1268
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:39,639
going to lead us into the opportunities

1269
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,960
for the pharmaceutical industry because

1270
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:43,598
the pharmaceutical industry has

1271
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,088
certainly seen the promise in CBD and

1272
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,400
has begun bringing products to the

1273
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:49,210
market like Sativex from GW

1274
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,180
Pharmaceuticals

1275
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:53,949
but medical cannabis activists are very

1276
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:56,469
concerned that if cannabis is made

1277
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:58,719
scheduled too it will leave it solely in

1278
00:51:56,469 --> 00:52:00,879
the hands of big pharma which won't

1279
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,919
benefit anyone except for big pharma

1280
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,269
pocketbooks so Seth what are your

1281
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,579
thoughts on the attempts by

1282
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:10,389
pharmaceutical companies to develop and

1283
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:11,260
profit from CBD medicine uh it's

1284
00:52:10,389 --> 00:52:13,539
complicated

1285
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,640
just like the plant which is what I

1286
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:18,579
really appreciate it

1287
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:20,219
GW Pharmaceuticals is a great example so

1288
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:24,130
they were granted essentially an

1289
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:26,048
monopoly in the UK to do cannabis

1290
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:28,780
research and the research that they have

1291
00:52:26,048 --> 00:52:31,599
done is phenomenal it's actually

1292
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:33,430
changing the way that people look at not

1293
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,470
only THC but more importantly the

1294
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:37,960
non-psychoactive cannabinoid they have a

1295
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:40,568
world-class breeding program they're in

1296
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,269
possession of some absolutely incredible

1297
00:52:40,568 --> 00:52:44,529
plants that nobody else has the rest of

1298
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:46,630
us are just basically trying to play

1299
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:48,220
catch-up now the problem with that is

1300
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,079
that we're playing catch-up with as I

1301
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:53,649
just mentioned a government-granted

1302
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,269
monopoly in the UK and American farmers

1303
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,760
American researchers have not had the

1304
00:52:55,269 --> 00:53:01,139
ability to to be able to make the

1305
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,549
inroads that GW has in the last 15 years

1306
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:05,529
the other issue with this is that

1307
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:08,349
they're trying to basically protect

1308
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:11,079
their long-term profit with the creation

1309
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:12,890
of epidemics it's a 20 to 1

1310
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:15,920
CBD to THC

1311
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:18,349
a compound that is going through

1312
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,860
clinical trials in the United States for

1313
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:25,309
Jobeth syndrome for childhood epilepsy

1314
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:28,730
now those are all really good things the

1315
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:30,710
main issue is that now GW

1316
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,409
Pharmaceuticals is engaging with

1317
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:35,539
lobbyists in states all across the

1318
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:39,379
country particularly states that do not

1319
00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:41,690
have adult use medical or even CBD only

1320
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,030
laws in place yet and what they're

1321
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:47,800
trying to do is Lobby those legislators

1322
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:53,210
to pass bills that essentially banned

1323
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:56,030
non-fda-approved CBD anybody who wants

1324
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:58,550
to get a CBD product then in those

1325
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00,860
states would be required under the state

1326
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:03,560
law to purchase GW Pharmaceuticals

1327
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:05,000
version of that there's a whole host of

1328
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:07,639
other issues that they come along with

1329
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,579
that in terms of creating problems for

1330
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:13,250
patients and other types of consumers

1331
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:15,049
but the main issue to me is just from a

1332
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,030
supply standpoint GW Pharmaceuticals

1333
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:19,190
just spent 40 million dollars to build

1334
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:22,010
out a brand-new production facility in

1335
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:25,280
California specifically for their CBD

1336
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:28,040
products forty million dollars was how

1337
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,260
much it costs them to in the letter that

1338
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:33,079
they sent out to their investors to be

1339
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:36,800
able to produce 1,000 pounds of CBD rich

1340
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:39,769
cannabis per year if they're successful

1341
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:42,289
in being able to lobby CBD products out

1342
00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:43,849
of states and they put their own product

1343
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:46,340
on the market and they're only able to

1344
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:47,900
produce a thousand pounds a year I think

1345
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:50,000
we're all going to be in a world of hurt

1346
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,280
and we're going to be paying in their

1347
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,809
estimates their own financial estimates

1348
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,430
anywhere between eighty three dollars

1349
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:58,730
two hundred and sixty six dollars per

1350
00:54:55,429 --> 00:55:02,239
gram a thousand pounds that that's not

1351
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:04,219
nearly enough no I mean if they have an

1352
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:07,029
exclusive market that's ridiculously low

1353
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:10,609
for all the people who need it there are

1354
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:12,890
in the state of Oregon we have the

1355
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:14,840
deputy epidemiological estimates are six

1356
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:19,210
hundred and fifteen children with dravet

1357
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:21,410
syndrome just based on on based on

1358
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:24,530
represent representation in the

1359
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:26,659
population that each one of those

1360
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:28,460
children require twelve pounds of

1361
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:30,819
cannabis high-cbd cannabis and we're

1362
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:33,380
talking you know 15% CBD or higher

1363
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:35,480
extracted and turned into oil just to be

1364
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:37,789
able to to meet their needs for a single

1365
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:41,559
year 12 pounds is you know significant

1366
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:44,539
but that's something that that any any

1367
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:46,489
decent industrial hemp farmer who's

1368
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:49,820
growing a high cannabinoid content seed

1369
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:52,009
can do with on one anchor and one acre

1370
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,800
of farmland say here in the valley in

1371
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:57,560
Oregon rents for say three hundred three

1372
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,789
hundred and fifty dollars the equipment

1373
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:00,079
that it would take to actually go out

1374
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:02,029
and plant and harvest an acre of

1375
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:07,159
cannabis most farmers have it just

1376
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:10,340
sitting around the the scale and the

1377
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:11,929
cost the economics of trying to pursue

1378
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,370
some of these different compounds from a

1379
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:15,109
pharmaceutical perspective with all the

1380
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:17,029
regulatory burdens and investors and

1381
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:19,460
that sort of thing is just completely

1382
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:22,100
out of line with what this what this

1383
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:27,019
plant can actually do and what farmers

1384
00:56:22,099 --> 00:56:29,839
can do with this plant geez and I mean

1385
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:32,360
just my mind is racing ahead thinking

1386
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:35,930
about if if the pharmaceutical companies

1387
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:40,640
are are successful with their lobbyists

1388
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:43,789
to not allow independent licensed

1389
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:47,449
cannabis producers to to create and

1390
00:56:43,789 --> 00:56:50,539
distribute CBD and if they you know two

1391
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:53,119
things will happen number one the the

1392
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:56,480
pharmaceutical companies will have it

1393
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,299
locked up and and and so ordinary

1394
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,639
law-abiding people will be forced to get

1395
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,320
some kind of not whole plant

1396
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:05,539
stripped-down version from the

1397
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,450
pharmaceutical company but then what's

1398
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:10,460
really going to happen is that the the

1399
00:57:08,449 --> 00:57:13,460
gray market for CBD is just going to

1400
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:16,490
explode because most people know that

1401
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:17,929
they want whole plant CBD and they and

1402
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:20,409
they don't don't want it from a

1403
00:57:17,929 --> 00:57:23,589
pharmaceutical company what a what a

1404
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:26,179
enforcement and legal mess that would be

1405
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:28,910
completely it gets even more complicated

1406
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:30,529
you know as it always does who in it

1407
00:57:28,909 --> 00:57:32,929
states have the ability to regulate

1408
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:35,630
their own medicines as well and that's

1409
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:37,669
why the that's why GW has gone after

1410
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:39,050
individual states trying to pass these

1411
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,980
laws rather than trying to do it at the

1412
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:42,829
national level

1413
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:46,880
they're definitely lobbying Congress and

1414
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:48,800
the FDA and the DEA on a regular basis

1415
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,170
to be able to make their product the

1416
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:54,289
only one available but at the end of the

1417
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:56,539
day you know there there's always been a

1418
00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:58,219
lot of people growing cannabis and that

1419
00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:00,949
was the reason that it made you know

1420
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:03,679
enforcement of any type of prohibition

1421
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:06,019
impossible and right now the genie is

1422
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:09,440
completely completely out of the bottle

1423
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:10,940
on with hemp production and all other

1424
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,740
forms of cannabis production at the

1425
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,510
state level I think it's going to be

1426
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:17,118
very difficult for for any

1427
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:19,970
pharmaceutical company if they don't

1428
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:23,150
have a very unique product that works

1429
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:24,799
incredibly well and they can get get

1430
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,670
doctors to be able to prescribe it I

1431
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,769
think they're going to have a very

1432
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:29,059
difficult time in recouping all those

1433
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:33,019
millions and millions of dollars they've

1434
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:35,059
put into to research um you know GW

1435
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:36,889
Pharma is one of the companies who are

1436
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:38,900
working on CBD products do you have an

1437
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:41,000
idea of how many other pharmaceutical

1438
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:44,720
companies I have got CBD products in the

1439
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,079
works not CBD products specifically but

1440
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,858
there are the last time I checked the

1441
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,720
Federal Register

1442
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:53,869
there were over 60 different companies

1443
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:56,779
that had registered with the DEA to be

1444
00:58:53,869 --> 00:59:01,369
able to produce cannabinoid products

1445
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:05,500
under the new there was a call for

1446
00:59:01,369 --> 00:59:09,130
proposals that the DEA put out for

1447
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:11,809
basically new product development and

1448
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:14,390
production to increase the total supply

1449
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:16,818
of cannabis that was available for

1450
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:19,098
researchers through the National

1451
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:20,900
Institute on Drug Abuse apparently the

1452
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:22,730
University of Mississippi's 12 acres is

1453
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,920
not enough and stuff that they have

1454
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:27,619
there is not is not good enough to to

1455
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:31,608
meet all the researchers demands but

1456
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:35,390
what it what it's led to is a pretty big

1457
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:37,098
explosion of mostly small but also some

1458
00:59:35,389 --> 00:59:39,019
medium-sized firms entering into the

1459
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:41,568
cannabinoid pharmaceutical marketplace

1460
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:45,469
so to go back to your one example with

1461
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:50,000
GW Pharma they spent 40 million on the

1462
00:59:45,469 --> 00:59:51,799
series of greenhouses to to grow I think

1463
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:58,309
you said a thousand pound

1464
00:59:51,800 --> 01:00:01,310
of over 15% CBD a year will they simply

1465
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:05,659
just scale up and and produce more of

1466
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:08,659
those to reach demand or or does scaling

1467
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:11,750
up at those numbers not work to bring

1468
01:00:08,659 --> 01:00:16,059
the price down yeah it's what we're

1469
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:19,960
dealing with is the demand and the need

1470
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:22,340
is is so much higher than what could be

1471
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,860
what could be achieved with a closed

1472
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:26,390
system in and the reason that GW had to

1473
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,890
spend so much money on that is all the

1474
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,349
security requirements that go along with

1475
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:32,299
producing a Schedule one compound

1476
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:34,219
you know the greenhouses have to be

1477
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:37,160
completely secure that the product

1478
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:38,989
facility has to be spotless and you know

1479
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:42,170
cameras everywhere everyone has to be

1480
01:00:38,989 --> 01:00:44,089
monitored at all times you know if you

1481
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,680
come out to our farm it's a field full

1482
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:47,329
of plants and we don't have any of that

1483
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:48,469
stuff except for a time-lapse camera

1484
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:50,029
because we just like watching what

1485
01:00:48,469 --> 01:00:52,849
happens to the plants either this isn't

1486
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:54,769
a totally different environment and and

1487
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:56,929
you know a lot of the other farmers that

1488
01:00:54,769 --> 01:00:59,090
are doing this have scaled in a similar

1489
01:00:56,929 --> 01:01:01,669
way you just like I was mentioning

1490
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:03,530
before you can't provide CBD to all the

1491
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,539
arthritic horses in greenhouses it's

1492
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:07,910
just not going to work I think that's a

1493
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:11,179
really good point you made because the

1494
01:01:07,909 --> 01:01:13,609
idea you know you know the way that GW

1495
01:01:11,179 --> 01:01:15,469
is doing it with all of the you know the

1496
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:18,470
fences and security and the cameras and

1497
01:01:15,469 --> 01:01:24,069
all the stuff it is it's an assumption

1498
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:26,779
that it's still a prohibitive or-or-or

1499
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:29,809
criminal drug that people are going to

1500
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:31,490
be you know wild drug-crazed people are

1501
01:01:29,809 --> 01:01:33,289
gonna be trying to break in to steal all

1502
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:36,199
the stuff that won't get them high at

1503
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:38,059
all you know yeah it's just you know

1504
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:40,369
yeah it still might be cannabis and yeah

1505
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:42,829
the tab you might still be out there but

1506
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:45,469
but you know people do not routinely

1507
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:47,210
steal CBD because their patients and

1508
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:51,679
they're generally too sick sick to steal

1509
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:53,240
anything yeah yeah it's again I mean

1510
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,190
this goes back to that that tripartite

1511
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:56,809
division when you've got folks that are

1512
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:58,090
developing pharmaceutical products you

1513
01:01:56,809 --> 01:01:59,719
have people that are developing

1514
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:01,820
recreational products and you have

1515
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:03,259
people who are just doing things a

1516
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,039
little bit differently on the agronomic

1517
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:07,220
side

1518
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:09,980
but I think there is always going to be

1519
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:12,230
a market for the types of products that

1520
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,490
these these cannabinoid pharmaceutical

1521
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:16,099
research companies are putting together

1522
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:18,859
and I think that it's really important

1523
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:21,679
for us to may not necessarily support a

1524
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:24,410
company that you know got to their spot

1525
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,940
in their market position via a natural

1526
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:27,319
monopoly in another country before

1527
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:29,840
Americans could actually do the research

1528
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:32,300
on it but I think it's also important to

1529
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:34,700
to see the benefits that have come out

1530
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,450
of that research because I mean as a

1531
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:38,029
plant breeder

1532
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:41,119
I read the work that GW pharmaceutical

1533
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:43,490
breeders wrote they published these

1534
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:46,069
these articles in peer-reviewed journals

1535
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:48,139
about how to attain different types of

1536
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:50,030
cannabinoids and plants and after that

1537
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:52,309
it just became an analytical and a

1538
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:56,210
sifting process for us to to find those

1539
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:59,029
things so it's they're doing good things

1540
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:01,730
but when you turn it into a monopoly and

1541
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:04,670
you try to control access to something

1542
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:05,869
that is already proliferating throughout

1543
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:08,059
the country I

1544
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:09,859
that's when I start to have issues and

1545
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:12,739
question the question the motives oh

1546
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:17,539
that's an awesome transition to our last

1547
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:19,369
topic which is I to read the GW Pharma

1548
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:22,429
papers because I wanted to find out what

1549
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:24,739
was in Sativex

1550
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:27,859
and when when it comes right down to it

1551
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:30,229
it's it's essentially roughly two point

1552
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:35,360
five milligrams of THC and two point

1553
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:37,670
five milligrams of CBD in an oral spray

1554
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:40,190
that you're supposed to take as needed

1555
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:43,220
up to like five times a day and you know

1556
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:46,909
that's so easy to reverse engineer into

1557
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:49,069
an alcohol tincture and then move you've

1558
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:52,730
got whole plant sativex that you made at

1559
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:55,580
home one thing for sure the gray market

1560
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:58,070
will be providing CBD to neighbors and

1561
01:03:55,579 --> 01:04:02,239
family and loved ones probably forever

1562
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:04,670
now that CBD genetics are all over the

1563
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:07,339
country do you think there's any model

1564
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:09,619
that would quell people from growing and

1565
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:12,920
sharing their own CBD with sick friends

1566
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:14,359
now that the genetics are everywhere the

1567
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:16,190
only thing that would make sense is that

1568
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,510
you can walk into a store and buy the

1569
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:19,250
product

1570
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:24,560
and you don't have to grow it prepare it

1571
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:26,389
and you know basically compound the the

1572
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:31,099
substance to give to your friends and

1573
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:33,139
family and if you walk into most stores

1574
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:37,159
at this point those products are already

1575
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:39,949
on the Shelf when it comes to CBD and I

1576
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:41,358
guess and the the challenge of course is

1577
01:04:39,949 --> 01:04:45,679
the model that we you and I were just

1578
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:47,599
discussing where where CBD you know go

1579
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:49,210
scheduled to and isn't solely in the

1580
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,759
hands of pharmaceutical companies that

1581
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:55,369
would theoretically put pressure on the

1582
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,080
states to to remove CBD from their

1583
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:59,539
licensing structure which I don't know

1584
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:02,599
how that would work but the idea is that

1585
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:06,349
you just can't limit availability of CBD

1586
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:09,380
because if you put any restriction on it

1587
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:11,420
the people will will work around it

1588
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:13,130
because their health is way more

1589
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:16,880
important to people than following the

1590
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:19,070
law 100% accurate I'm looking at this

1591
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,980
this move by GW Pharmaceuticals and

1592
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:24,470
reaching out to the farmers that we work

1593
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,608
with here in Oregon and saying you know

1594
01:05:24,469 --> 01:05:28,039
they're going to go forward with this

1595
01:05:25,608 --> 01:05:29,539
and and keep this is something to keep

1596
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:30,920
in mind as well with just the way that

1597
01:05:29,539 --> 01:05:32,750
the laws are written as I'd mentioned

1598
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:36,740
the state's actually do have a little

1599
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:39,050
bit of control over over drugs it's not

1600
01:05:36,739 --> 01:05:41,750
just the FDA so if you're manufacturing

1601
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:43,880
a product in your state and it that

1602
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:46,369
product does not leave your state it's

1603
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:49,400
sold within the boundaries and under the

1604
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:51,530
legal framework of your state the FDA

1605
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,090
can't do anything to step in and say hey

1606
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:56,000
you can't do that unless you're making

1607
01:05:53,090 --> 01:06:00,050
medical claims so in the case of CBD and

1608
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:04,150
say children with dravet syndrome we

1609
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:06,950
could just give it away which I mean

1610
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:08,809
from a perspective of seeing cannabis

1611
01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:11,689
culture change now that it's been

1612
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:14,840
permeated by by legal in a legalization

1613
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:17,809
and the forces that come along with with

1614
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,280
modern late-stage capitalism to me

1615
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:21,829
that's that's a bit of beautiful

1616
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,780
beautiful contribution to kind of keep

1617
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:26,119
in line with what the people who kept

1618
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:28,470
cannabis alive during the Prohibition

1619
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:32,608
would want to have happen

1620
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:33,899
so I honestly I think companies like GW

1621
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:38,639
need to be very careful with their

1622
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:41,818
approach because people have people have

1623
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:43,348
have the ability to to undermine what

1624
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:45,690
they're trying to do you know

1625
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:48,269
mechanisation doesn't work I don't think

1626
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:51,150
people have been saying free the plant

1627
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:52,829
for all these decades free the plant for

1628
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:54,720
pharmaceutical companies you know they

1629
01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:56,309
they wanted it back in the hands of the

1630
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,828
citizens amen

1631
01:06:56,309 --> 01:07:00,780
yeah it's I agree with that and at the

1632
01:06:58,829 --> 01:07:02,548
same time I also it's I'm going to

1633
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,680
hammer at home one more time the

1634
01:07:02,548 --> 01:07:08,068
research that they're doing is stuff

1635
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:11,338
that you know I have a PhD and know how

1636
01:07:08,068 --> 01:07:12,750
science works I can't do what these

1637
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:15,058
these big companies are doing they're

1638
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:17,309
doing some really incredible work and

1639
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:19,349
they should be able to to get that

1640
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:21,240
product in the hands of people who could

1641
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:23,490
benefit from it and they they deserve to

1642
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:24,868
make some money off of it but total

1643
01:07:23,489 --> 01:07:26,219
control of the marketplace is not

1644
01:07:24,869 --> 01:07:30,900
something that should ever be ceded to

1645
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:32,939
any any individual or corporation right

1646

on well set thank you so much for taking

nice to talk to somebody who's got a

1649
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:42,029
command of the economics of the CBD

1650
01:07:38,969 --> 01:07:44,699
market like you do because so much of

the talk around CBD is just myth and

1652
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:49,348
rumor and people playing the telephone

1653
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:51,900
game with facts so to be able to come
