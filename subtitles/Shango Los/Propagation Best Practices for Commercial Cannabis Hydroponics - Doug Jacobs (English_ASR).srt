1
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,910
all right I guess I'm just gonna speak

2
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:17,618
up since there's no microphone here on

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,980
the podium welcome everybody to the

00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:22,899
10:30 presentation propagation best

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,630
practices from commercial scale

6
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:27,608
cultivation for optimal growth if you

7
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:29,768
would please silence your cellphone's

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,810
I am Shango Lowe's host of the shaping

00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:33,670
fire podcast if you like listening to

10
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,679
smart interviews with the top minds in

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,039
cannabis I invite you to check out the

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,628
show at shaping fire calm we also have

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,088
an extraordinary youtube channel with

14
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:44,558
over 150 speaker videos I recorded at

15
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:46,899
events just like this one

16
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,390
Doug Jacobs our speaker is already on

17
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:52,030
the channel and will be posting this

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,149
presentation next week

19
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,670
Doug Jacobs is technical advisor with

20
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:00,039
grodan providing expert consulting on

21
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,780
proven precision growing methods he has

22
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,850
extensive experience with indoor outdoor

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,400
and greenhouse hydroponics vertical

24
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,920
farms aquaculture and cea system design

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,570
today Doug will be speaking about proven

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,820
precision growing methods to optimize

27
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,829
crop production using irrigation

28
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:16,899
strategies and other operational factors

29
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:18,760
to produce the best quality plants using

30
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,719
the least amount of inputs and you

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,700
taught me on the side we're going to

32
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:25,349
talk a lot about mothers today so please

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,350
put it together for Doug Jacobs

34
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:41,899
good morning thanks to the excellent

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,240
introduction so yeah my name is doc

36
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:47,118
Jacobs I'm a technical advisor for Rodan

37
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,158
I started growing plants probably when I

38
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,129
was a baby than their parents did

39
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,240
rewards and tropicals in South Florida

40
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:54,408
you know like a lot of people in this

41
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,530
room I probably got involved with

42
00:01:54,409 --> 00:02:00,049
cannabis early around 14 15 years old

43
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,189
you know drew a little bit sold a little

44
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,890
bit really was fascinated by the plant

45
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:09,099
got out of it probably right before

46
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,659
legalization started doing urban farming

47
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:14,150
vegetable consulting and building every

48
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:16,280
type of pot farms greenhouses got a lot

49
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,200
of cool experiences out of that and

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,900
about four years ago I started working

51
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,969
for grodan did you think I was gonna end

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,489
up doing cannabis again but happy to be

53
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:27,949
here we've been spending the last four

54
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,080
years helping to marry a commercial

55
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:32,629
vegetable production with cannabis

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,700
production so a little bit about grodan

57
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,469
you know for 50 years growing husband a

58
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,389
leader in manufacturing hydroponic

59
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:40,759
substrates for these commercial

60
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:43,009
horticulture industry with a focus on

61
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:46,870
informant formative and sustainability

62
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:50,389
we've developed propagation blocks plugs

63
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,640
slabs loose substrates for tomatoes

64
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:55,638
cucumbers peppers and obviously for

65
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,349
cannabis our goal has been to help

66
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,519
increase the sustainability of our

67
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:03,799
farmers around the world using less

68
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,319
water less the nutrient decreasing labor

69
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:11,180
costs while increasing yield and quality

70
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,429
in addition to making growing media we

71
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,680
have developed tools like the burden

72
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,719
grow sense water content sensor that

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,180
allows you to make

74
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:23,830
the water content and EC in the root

75
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,450
zone in real time giving you insights

76
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,219
this allows you to stupid plant growth

77
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:30,619
providing exactly what the plants need

78
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:34,789
they are not to grow drastically

79
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:37,939
reducing the amount of water nutrient to

80
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:39,229
grow those crops and we're going to be

81
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,419
building on this knowledge experience

82
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:43,429
over the next couple of years increasing

83
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:45,649
these tools and building substrate

84
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,849
specific to cannabis to increase your

85
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:52,219
sustainability profitability so today

86
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:54,199
we're going to talk about uniformity

87
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:57,319
where I talk a lot about growing mother

88
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,419
plants taking cuttings the veg phase and

89
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,599
a little bit about rock structures

90
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:05,919
primarily from the tomato industry and

91
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,900
how they might be applied to to cannabis

92
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,299
so uniformity in greenhouse and indoor

93
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,879
farming is a fundamental requirement for

94
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,980
making consistent quality plants the

95
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,469
farm design and plant care plan should

96
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:21,168
be developed with uniformity of mind

97
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,660
that is why modern greenhouses are tall

98
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:27,079
built to a large footprint with no

99
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:30,050
internal walls to create differences in

100
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:32,389
environment making a uniform climate for

101
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,569
for tank growth heating systems are

102
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:38,509
designed to deliver he irrigation the

103
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:41,089
informant uniformly and grower has left

104
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:43,639
the soil over 50 years ago to grown

105
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:45,109
Rodin because of improvements and

106
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,689
sustainability and uniformity it

107
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,580
provided so say 50 years ago a tomato

108
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:53,560
grower could get 10 kilograms per meter

109
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:53,560
squared and how we can get almost 100

110
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,800
uniformity really starts with with

111
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,729
another stock and propagation because it

112
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,620
can if you can repeat we throw that of

113
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:05,539
young plants and steer them correctly

114
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,629
from the start you can maximize

115
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,110
production and growth while all other

116
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:13,759
subsequent inputs labor client

117
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,218
to be optimized delivering the highest

118
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,270
quality cannabis plants time after time

119
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:21,468
so sourcing mother stock as you know is

120
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:23,448
probably the most important step to

121
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:25,550
creating uniform crop whether you're

122
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:28,250
getting rooted cuttings seeds tissue

123
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,419
culture starts you should take steps to

124
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,899
ensure you're not bringing pests and

125
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:34,218
disease into your tiered grows a test

126
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,228
batch of plants should be created and

127
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:38,209
run through a whole life cycle to

128
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:41,120
determine how they perform in your

129
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:43,008
facility you should take notes on how

130
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,689
these plants developed at every stage

131
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,770
how they reacted to pruning climate

132
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:51,528
irrigation conditions and climate

133
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:55,218
conditions will help you move these

134
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:57,139
plants into production other things in

135
00:05:55,218 --> 00:05:59,000
crop registration which is not common in

136
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,340
cannabis should be taken on we should

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,228
find measurements that we need to to

138
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,638
take to see any cause this crop

139
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:06,168
developing is it's developing

140
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,778
differently from the last time I'm

141
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:10,098
through it and why because if you're not

142
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:12,620
taking these measurements you'll never

143
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:15,740
get any understanding of how the crop is

144
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,829
is developing so like taking notes on

145
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,139
route speed quality of the routes the

146
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:24,800
plant height stem diameter leaf and stem

147
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:27,288
color node spacing the the natural

148
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,629
structure of the cramp of the plant so

149
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:31,310
taking a none top plant putting into

150
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,319
production see how it develops on its

151
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,939
own and the making decision on how to

152
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:40,520
treat that plant later on but before you

153
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,718
can even grow your mother plants you

154
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,698
have to select the substrate type

155
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:46,098
determine how much volume is needed for

156
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:48,710
each mother an ideal planting density

157
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:51,560
all of which will define the irrigation

158
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:53,028
system requirements canvas while the

159
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,769
plants are typically kept in large

160
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:56,959
amounts of growing media you know five

161
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:58,609
to twenty five gallons of substrate and

162
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,739
water than three point a usually three

163
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,550
to six times per day is they're lucky

164
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,019
this is a carryover from black and gray

165
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,419
market days where you have limited space

166
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:09,359
to commit to your mother's plant count

167
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:12,779
restrictions of the

168
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,490
non-fans you could have so it's time to

169
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,809
sort of we look at this with growing

170
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,579
mothers and see if there's a better way

171
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,098
to get more consistency out of gonna

172
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,750
crop so having large mother people

173
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:24,329
having large mothers and large vines and

174
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,819
substrates has several drawbacks first

175
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:32,098
it increases the risk of one bad mob

176
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:33,718
spoiling a whole batch effects taking

177
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:35,339
large amounts of cuttings from a single

178
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:37,319
plant all at once creates a lot of

179
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,668
stress on the mother cannabis is a very

180
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,050
resilient plant to you otherwise

181
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:41,728
wouldn't know there's anything wrong

182
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,310
with it just by looking at it most of

183
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:46,139
the time the tipping you know third or

184
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,668
fourth of the plant off at one time it

185
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,949
does create a lot of stress and has a

186
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:54,598
cascading effect on all your subsequent

187
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:56,778
cuttings down the road and then finally

188
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,800
a labor perspective large mothers

189
00:07:56,778 --> 00:08:01,199
sometimes require workers to get on the

190
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,329
ladders were constrained positions that

191
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,259
you know increase your liability as as

192
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:09,508
growers and owners so it's time to look

193
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,370
at maybe using a higher density of

194
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:14,009
mothers smaller mothers and smaller

195
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,490
substrates that are more reactive that

196
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,288
you can steer this increases this

197
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,538
decreases the threat that one mother

198
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:26,399
would pose to a whole batch of tanks and

199
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:29,189
using a smaller volume of substrates or

200
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,049
growing media especially something like

201
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:34,288
grow dad with a lot of group space would

202
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:39,750
allow you to use irrigation as a tool to

203
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:41,729
steer mother growth so when I talk about

204
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,839
crop steering for those who haven't been

205
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,639
to one of these presentations before

206
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,649
we're talking about the difference

207
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,750
between vegetative and generative growth

208
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,480
so vegetative growth simply put on

209
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,970
growing leaves and stems focusing on

210
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,250
building out the crop the plant where

211
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,829
general growth is I focus more on fruits

212
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,198
and flowers but I can use the steering

213
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:03,599
for both regardless at what stage so I

214
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:04,870
can be generative in my mother exactly

215
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,509
generative with

216
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,460
like regenerative and veg genitive and

217
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,379
flour I can be vegetative in all those

218
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,629
stages I think I think that's where the

219
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,669
problem starts is that a lot of growers

220
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:18,759
start out generative and upbeat

221
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:20,528
vegetative and end up hurting

222
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,559
development so a little more detail to

223
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:25,330
this you know so vegetative irrigation

224
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,819
strategies have to be higher water

225
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,490
contents you have smaller decreases

226
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,800
overnight in smaller dry box so

227
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,080
decreasing water content by and you do

228
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,689
this by manipulating the start and stop

229
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,129
times of irrigation your decent

230
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,710
frequencies typically higher so I think

231
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:43,480
of aeroponic systems the more times I

232
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,670
can deliver irrigations to the plant

233
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,700
without over saturating the root zone

234
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,829
the faster I can get it to grow each

235
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,450
seeds having lower Easy's allowing for

236
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,310
easier uptake of water is more

237
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,410
vegetative and then having an overall

238
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:58,809
higher substrate temperatures is more

239
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:01,059
fetch data and then generative on the

240
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:03,819
other side is is lower and decreasing

241
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,739
water contents again being manipulated

242
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,050
by these start and stop times of the

243
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,269
irrigations of the day irrigation

244
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:12,250
frequency though were typically

245
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:14,199
delivering the same volumes we're just

246
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,360
taking away the frequency and just

247
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,150
delivering a bigger shot of irrigation

248
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,100
so you know when I want to be more

249
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,919
vegetative I have smaller shot size but

250
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,310
overall I'm just changing the way I'm

251
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,679
applying the same amount of water

252
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:31,869
eces to the rehire ECS and generous

253
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,609
steering and then substrate temperatures

254
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,159
you know you've been making the natural

255
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:40,480
seasonal change by decreasing the roots

256
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,219
on tap like irrigation climate has a

257
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,350
significant effect on how the plants

258
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,230
grow and can be used as a tool to steer

259
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,730
growth how does the lighting pipe and

260
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,480
the environment affect later stage

261
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:55,750
development plants switching from

262
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,670
fluorescents to HVS or from LEDs to HBS

263
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,830
you know can cause a lot of problems so

264
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:02,019
you need to take note of these and

265
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,960
really see hey I'm going from a lower

266
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:07,720
lighting source to a higher

267
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,009
agents are so going from LEDs to HBS I

268
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,070
don't necessarily want to match the

269
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:14,350
intensities I may want to go lower to

270
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,240
prevent stressin from changing these

271
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:22,930
plans from from cuttings to veg to

272
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:24,430
flower so how can you effectively steer

273
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,259
mother plants back and forth to get

274
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:27,819
better cuttings faster while at the same

275
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,950
time managing growth so your mothers

276
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,420
don't grow out of control even when

277
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,310
taking their cuttings you need to take

278
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,319
note of the environmental conditions

279
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,659
that you're taking the cuttings in you

280
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,390
know having high light intensity low

281
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:43,029
humidity while taking the cuttings can

282
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:44,259
affect the the cutting quality same

283
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:48,659
thing with a mother to do I want a very

284
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:51,069
active mother on her highlight high

285
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:52,389
humidity high temperatures when I'm

286
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,370
taking the cuttings and then trying to

287
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:55,929
stick them that I probably wanna reduce

288
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,220
my light intensities at the time of

289
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,139
taking the cuttings super your roars

290
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:05,740
your workers will appreciate this as

291
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:06,939
well so as I mentioned before the weight

292
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,549
cannabis when the plants are cultivated

293
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,280
might need to be revisited so we're

294
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:13,659
going to talk previously briefly about

295
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,730
the method of propagation for

296
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:17,769
chrysanthemum flowers to see how it can

297
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,810
be adopted apply it to to cannabis

298
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:21,569
so chrysanthemum other plants are

299
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:25,739
typically grown at a very high density

300
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:28,690
30 to 40 plants per square metre 1.8 to

301
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,049
2.5 plants per square foot so this is

302
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:35,830
like sea of green style of growing this

303
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:38,639
allows high density mother's we grown

304
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,410
give you typically straighter cuttings

305
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,840
more vigorous cuttings the high density

306
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:46,360
hedge also reduces the threat of one mom

307
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,170
affect a whole batch of cuttings but how

308
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,789
does this delivery uniformity so when

309
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,750
they're gonna go santhu of others they

310
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:55,539
typically

311
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,460
all the plants have the same number of

312
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,809
these sets so they used leaf sets of the

313
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,840
determining factor of wanting to take

314
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:03,399
the cup to pinch the first half so after

315
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,110
the mothers of the planted and growing

316
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,629
for about four weeks until they hit four

317
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,009
or five leaves tall then the head and

318
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:10,720
the leaf is pinched creating a uniform

319
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,299
crop structure across all the mothers

320
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,360
here you see the the pinch on the fifth

321
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:19,059
leaf so keeping the number of leaves and

322
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,210
branches even across all the plants is

323
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:24,519
cheap keeping the growth rate the same

324
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,960
the low crop structure makes it easier

325
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,159
for growers to harvest the cuttings and

326
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:33,670
instead of taking only straight tops so

327
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,860
15 to 17 17 days after the first finish

328
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:37,449
two cuttings have taken these are all

329
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,550
straight tops it has the highest growth

330
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,080
potential so this first flush and I

331
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:43,809
think mushrooms that first flush of

332
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,340
mushrooms is usually the strongest then

333
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:48,789
subsequent flushes and cuttings can be

334
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,290
taken every every week or two during

335
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:52,110
this process you may end up with some

336
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:55,149
taller plants that may be jam-packed

337
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,039
between and before harvest as you see

338
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:58,090
here on all the cuttings are taking in

339
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,649
one day

340
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,180
so really traditionally with the

341
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:03,220
chrysanthemums there they're grown in

342
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:05,319
another country they're cut the footing

343
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,690
of a frigerator and then they're shipped

344
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,580
to the greenhouse and then the planted

345
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,960
at once so this is something some

346
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,910
cannabis growers are starting to

347
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,680
experiment with it's taking the cuttings

348
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:15,669
putting in the refrigerator and then

349
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,209
taking them out when they're ready to

350
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:20,740
stick so as to go through each

351
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,330
subsequent flush you'll need to maintain

352
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,100
an equal number of leaves and branches

353
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,530
between them other plants to keep them

354
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,269
growing at the same rate to figure out

355
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,500
how exactly this can be applied to

356
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,750
cannabis with all the different

357
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,850
cultivars that includes will take some

358
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,250
experimentation and crop registration

359
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,779
and what the ideal number of leaves the

360
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,629
growth speed and how many cuttings can

361
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:43,000
produce in what time frame once you've

362
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:45,220
done this a few times with each cultivar

363
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,889
you can create an ideal crop structure

364
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:52,420
density and develop schedule for cutting

365
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:53,539
specific to that variety so making some

366
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:55,759
other plants

367
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:58,009
between each harvest of cuttings the

368
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,389
growers will then go through these

369
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,370
plants almost daily to ensure that

370
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,289
they're growing informally leaves are

371
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,659
removed graduates so they're not doing

372
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:07,279
full strips of the plants because you

373
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:09,079
know the leaves are not only sold solar

374
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,519
panels they're the batteries the cold

375
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,740
water and the whole nutrients and they

376
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,389
help keep the plant in balance so if you

377
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,129
start ripping off the leaves excessively

378
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,169
or all at once it can throw other plants

379
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:20,439
out of out of balance some plants while

380
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:23,679
take water faster or slower than others

381
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,270
so it's something to be considerate of

382
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,239
so in chrysanthemums specifically that

383
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:30,559
keep these mothers for about 26 weeks

384
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,940
because they see a significant decrease

385
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,529
in cutting success rates after 26 weeks

386
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,690
but considering the success with

387
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,389
cannabis it might be even shorter we've

388
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,190
seen growers find that after 3 months of

389
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,500
having a mother planted cutting

390
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,420
successor it just takes a nosedive you

391
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,110
know where they were getting a 90 80 %

392
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:53,029
second success they got down to 60 50

393
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,680
percent I can't explain why was that

394
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,809
mother's been stressed out it's been

395
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,899
there too long it's it's time to time to

396
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:01,909
change it out so to take the most

397
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:06,110
uniform cuttings possible with the least

398
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:08,600
amount labor to Santa Cruz use this

399
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,310
specialty tool here to help ensure all

400
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,070
the cuttings are the same length

401
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:14,869
this plastic tool uses a flat surface

402
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:17,410
with the sharp edge that not only

403
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,970
supports the cutting as it's being taken

404
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:22,730
but also ensures all the cuttings are

405
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,410
the exact same length with a uniform

406
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,490
number of these sets with without the

407
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:31,669
need of additional labor so only new

408
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,259
growth head cuttings are taken even

409
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:35,149
those with cannabis you can take lower

410
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,419
growth cuttings and still have similar

411
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:40,189
success rate and some stem is left above

412
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:42,490
the note to protect it so you can grow

413
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,490
another

414
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:50,969
so it's important to have a clear visual

415
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,940
scale for the size cutting you wish to

416
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,500
make San Thurman growers use this visual

417
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,350
scale to group the cuttings together to

418
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,029
maintain uniformity so stem diameters

419
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,330
use to group the cutting this acts that

420
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:05,129
good or thin and by having this visual

421
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,470
and measurable standard to group the

422
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,330
cuttings together allows them to be

423
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,959
placed in batches so they all can grow

424
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:16,500
at the same rate in addition to keeping

425
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,779
the stem length diameter it's consistent

426
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,099
between the cuttings they also have to

427
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,709
ensure that the cuttings have the same

428
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,329
number of leaves so if you're lucky

429
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,390
enough to have spaced intercolonial room

430
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:29,849
you should should create a tray spacing

431
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,640
that does not require you to have to cut

432
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:34,529
off too many leaves in the tips which is

433
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,810
a contributing factor to creative

434
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:38,730
differences in growth rates so I mean

435
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:41,099
there's been some university studies in

436
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,490
Canada that found that just taking the

437
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:46,679
leaf tips reduces cutting success rate

438
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,609
anywhere from like seventy one fifty

439
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,080
percent so I mean we take leave tips off

440
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:53,699
because we're trying to cram a lot of

441
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,009
plants in one space that if we leave

442
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,140
more leaf tips on and technically more

443
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,700
leaves and then find it ideal spacing

444
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,100
they'll probably get healthier cuttings

445
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,830
so that same study done by the

446
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:07,079
University of Guelph found that cuttings

447
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:09,329
with three leaves as opposed to two

448
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,909
leaves had a 15% higher quality and

449
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:14,129
rooting which is pretty significant so

450
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,050
if you have that space in the luxury to

451
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,730
to spread out your cuttings and not do

452
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:23,369
the typical 98 72 or 50 plants per tray

453
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,930
you'll find that you know 20 to 25

454
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:27,500
plants in a tray tables will give you a

455
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,500
better quality

456
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,759
so now that we have uniformity in mom's

457
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,990
and some uniform make cuttings we now

458
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,599
have to place them and construct

459
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,509
substrate and have a way to maintain the

460
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,099
cuttings until the next stage of growth

461
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:43,450
first if you have the luxury of space

462
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:44,709
you'll need to find a good density that

463
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,798
allows you to grow these cuttings

464
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,538
without being overcrowded in the tray

465
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,490
substrate volume can be adjusted based

466
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:53,679
on how long you intend to keep the

467
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,740
cuttings in the nursery tray so you can

468
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,720
use a small small amount of substrate

469
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,460
and grow very small cutting and have a

470
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,909
transplant a very fast but if you use a

471
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,950
bigger volume so we're using a two inch

472
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:09,250
propagation cube you probably

473
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,659
accomplished a little bigger cutting and

474
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,159
if you have an irrigation system that

475
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:13,990
allows you to water it more frequently

476
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,370
without over saturating the root zone

477
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:20,140
you could probably accomplish some of

478
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:22,689
your veg in the cutting base so having a

479
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:26,320
larger volume so the timing and

480
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:28,240
frequency used to irrigate cuttings has

481
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:31,210
a tremendous effect on how the plants

482
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,859
develop so wandering too early seems to

483
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,380
be the biggest problem for most cannabis

484
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:37,418
growers especially in Rockwall Rockwell

485
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,669
has a a higher of water holding capacity

486
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:42,400
than most other substrates so if you

487
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:44,770
water too much too frequently you'll

488
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,350
have for root development so the idea

489
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:49,389
after the first stick your cuttings and

490
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:51,879
substrate you look the the growing media

491
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,190
dry that typically you could use weights

492
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,600
to determine when your water and then

493
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,490
when you go for that first irrigation

494
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,869
you don't want to submerge the cube

495
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,460
again you don't want to push up all that

496
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:02,589
airspace because it's gonna slow down

497
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,690
plant development so you may just want

498
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:07,298
to tap the bottoms of the blocks just

499
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,298
really just touch them just to give some

500
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:12,369
new nutrient and bring the water content

501
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:14,379
back up a little bit but not up to full

502
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:17,829
capacity because that will slow you down

503
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,680
and then watering too soon so you know

504
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:21,089
just

505
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,680
your hand does not necessarily the best

506
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,329
measure especially for if you're letting

507
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,610
your laborers do it so you may want to

508
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,799
actually report the weights of the trays

509
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:30,659
or the plugs and use math to determine

510
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,460
when to water especially for hard

511
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:37,019
routing varieties that such as it seemed

512
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:41,700
to take forever so now that you have

513
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:44,039
your selected substrate you have system

514
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,680
for irrigation that automates or your

515
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,269
propagation now you have to wet up your

516
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,830
substrate so commercially this is

517
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:52,049
typically done with with wedding lines

518
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:56,099
these are conveyor belt systems with

519
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:59,309
three three booms of water that slowly

520
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:01,139
move the blocks across a system that

521
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:02,759
what's up the lots automatically most of

522
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,920
us don't have access to this equipment

523
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:08,789
that depending on your skill it may make

524
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:11,940
sense to automate this process the other

525
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:14,039
option is a wedding card so same concept

526
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,309
except in my manual I have three wedding

527
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,379
booms I'm moving the the card slowly

528
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,450
over the Watts to allow the water to

529
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,150
saturate the box if I throw too much

530
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,940
water too fast on the substrate I could

531
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,470
potentially just bypass the substrate of

532
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,480
different parts that water won't sprint

533
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,610
out we'll just go down and out so you

534
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,640
really have to work on applying either

535
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:39,659
water really slowly or fully submerged

536
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:42,480
your blocks and plugs to get initial

537
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,920
saturation once you initially saturate

538
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,690
your substrate you then have to check

539
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,190
the weights it's the only way you can

540
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,230
determine if I clean it up correctly and

541
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,269
consistency consistently across the

542
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,400
batch so using weights as a measurement

543
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,109
to determine how about have I fully

544
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,820
saturated my substrate and when did your

545
00:21:55,109 --> 00:22:02,369
date aren't probably the most important

546
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:03,809
tools you could use as a grower so again

547
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:06,509
yah weights weights the plugs and trees

548
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:08,250
and block students checked after initial

549
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:10,500
saturation to ensure that they've been

550
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,150
saturated correctly and it also helps

551
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,880
you determine hey is there something

552
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,530
with either the way up when it up or is

553
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,250
the substrate holding more or less water

554
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:23,309
and then am I gonna have to irrigate

555
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,049
sooner or later otherwise you're just

556
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:27,569
assuming everything is correct and

557
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:29,430
you're - Lee apply arrogation without

558
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:35,759
any consideration to what's going on in

559
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:38,160
the root zone so as you probably know

560
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:44,910
climate has a significant effect on how

561
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:47,160
cuttings developed often I see lowlights

562
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,920
and cutting rooms so less than the 70%

563
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,440
are 70 micromoles where in most other

564
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,759
earth culture crops 70 to 90 micromoles

565
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,029
is what's used just to supplement

566
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:59,640
natural sunlight at a greenhouse so this

567
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:02,519
low light intensity for cuttings

568
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,100
potentially slows down plant growth it

569
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:08,279
opens up the plants to diseases and

570
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:10,859
extreme humidity with low light

571
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:14,029
intensity can create Dino foiler

572
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:16,589
diseases so when you have plants in a

573
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:18,710
humidity dome with low light intensities

574
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:22,069
potentially high heat from a heat map or

575
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,259
the heat from the layers below it your

576
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:27,809
trading environment you create walls and

577
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:30,240
it's a lot of problems where people of

578
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:32,159
the top rebuilding problems are the

579
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,640
mildews and fungus those typically

580
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,840
started propagation so for example when

581
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,850
doing chrysanthemums this is a

582
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,538
chrysanthemum greenhouse in Holland they

583
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:44,978
do about how

584
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:46,749
many cuts per week when they lay out the

585
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:48,249
cuts they lay out a plastic tarp just

586
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:51,129
over top of all the cutting so you have

587
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:53,169
a big volume of air that makes it

588
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:55,138
consistent across the entire batch but

589
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:57,729
it's also keeping the moisture

590
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:59,378
potentially away from the leaf tips so

591
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,788
if you notice the cuttings that are at

592
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:02,978
the end developed differently than the

593
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:04,749
cuttings that are in the center so we

594
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:06,669
have to look at systems that allow us to

595
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:09,190
raise the humidity without creating

596
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:10,929
moisture on the canopy so it's a

597
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,088
revisiting of density and the cutting

598
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:15,669
traits but also trying to figure out

599
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:17,588
ways to grow cuttings without domes no

600
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:24,839
commercial crop other than cannabis is

601
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:26,618
used uses domes so to get the best

602
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,269
techniques possible you should look at a

603
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:33,908
system that maintains humidity between

604
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:35,919
70 90 percent lower should you know work

605
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:37,329
to ensure that the leaf temps the plant

606
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,119
temps themselves and not getting too

607
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:41,858
high so using a infrared thermometer

608
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:44,408
going in and checking hey so my root

609
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:45,848
zone tough to high or is the leader high

610
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:50,249
especially when you're first placing

611
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:50,249
those cuttings into the propagation

612
00:24:53,170 --> 00:25:00,640
so managing transit transitions from

613
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,100
cuttings to the growth grow out stages a

614
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,690
critical time so where possible you

615
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:06,369
should work to adjust the climate of the

616
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,370
cuttings gradually over the course of

617
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:12,159
several days to Maxo of the environment

618
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:15,250
you plan to transplant into fairy-tale

619
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,350
your - to match the the climates can

620
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,849
cause a negative reaction that you will

621
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,250
not notice immediately

622
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:24,039
Kazi shot to the plants and slowing down

623
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,589
development and reducing quality so if I

624
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,720
go from my my propagation room is

625
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:31,599
sending it to 90 micro balls and a low

626
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,789
temperature to by my bedroom with you

627
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,740
know 200 to 300 micro balls you know

628
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:38,079
really high light intensity high high

629
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,940
heat no humidity you know you can really

630
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,039
mess up their cup and not know it

631
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,390
not know until weeks later so it's

632
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,399
really important to match those things

633
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,380
or get the cuttings used to that

634
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,950
environment prior to even putting them

635
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,510
in the new substrate again the same

636
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,120
thing is transitioning from lighting

637
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:57,700
types so if I go from florescent into

638
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,039
HPS or led to HBS I don't necessarily

639
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,980
want to match the light intensities I'd

640
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:05,409
probably want to go lower on the HBS or

641
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,610
really any just when you make that

642
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:10,779
transition you should probably make that

643
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:13,949
up the new environment temperature lower

644
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:17,769
just to keep the plants a little more

645
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:19,480
safe until they're ready to to take off

646
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:20,349
when to be moved into the new substrate

647
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,890
community

648
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:28,538
you can grow fast as I talked about

649
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,460
earlier irrigation strategy is a

650
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:34,000
critical tool on how the plants develop

651
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,740
each irrigation of top slide sends a

652
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,319
vegetative signal to the plant to grow

653
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,509
think of a house plants grow again in in

654
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,210
their atomic systems since the roots are

655
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:45,190
grown in air the drive acts are faster

656
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:48,038
allowing for more frequent irrigation

657
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:50,140
and drives growth and speed if the goal

658
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:52,240
is to to develop the root zone dryvax

659
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,740
are important part of this process

660
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,349
especially when rooting into a new

661
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,179
substrate volume is again where

662
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,158
measurements by weight sensors come into

663
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:02,710
play to help you determine when when

664
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,179
done to your game if the roots are

665
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,710
leaving the block it's most likely

666
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:07,990
because you're applying too much water

667
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,058
you're achieving too much drain or you

668
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,349
have water buildup in the table you know

669
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:13,329
if you're growing in the substrate you

670
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:15,428
typically want to keep the roots in that

671
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:17,079
substrate if you're promoting the growth

672
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,759
outside of the box you're opening

673
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:20,349
yourselves up to more disease so when I

674
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,089
go to transplant I have all these

675
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:23,529
exposed roots in the bottom I don't put

676
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:25,869
it into something else I'm going to

677
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:31,269
damage these roots and attention to open

678
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:33,279
it up to to a virus or a capital so an

679
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:35,470
irrigation system is really the only way

680
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,720
to get consistent and uniform reefs a

681
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,569
chwarae sinead eurasian even for

682
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,519
cuttings and an in vet

683
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:44,408
irrigation systems like flood tables NFT

684
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,079
systems that use shallow trays with a

685
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:48,760
small water food running process not

686
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,788
only allows you to automate the aeration

687
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,529
process but will help you maintain the

688
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:53,890
uniformity you've worked so hard to

689
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:57,099
create

690
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:59,679
so inconsistencies created by hand up in

691
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:01,209
trays and watering will carry through

692
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,610
the up throughout the entire lifecycle

693
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,558
plan

694
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:07,298
flood heights and dip times can be

695
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,599
adjusted to apply just the amount of

696
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:12,549
water to steer the plants as you see fit

697
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,379
hand watering is possible during

698
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:17,680
face but it creates a lot of

699
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,480
inconsistencies so when selecting your

700
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,250
engaging system for better for cuttings

701
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,049
it's important to have a system that

702
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,630
allows you to manipulate a flood height

703
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:27,250
so I may I may want to fly high that

704
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,800
first irrigation when I'm saturated

705
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,569
substrate may be the second one

706
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,059
but later ones I may just want to apply

707
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:35,889
very small just touch the bottom with

708
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:37,990
the blocks or the pop so I'm not

709
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:42,910
completely pushing out all the air from

710
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:47,589
the the growing media so here's an

711
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:49,509
example graph initial dry back from

712
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:51,970
abroad and small block for for tomato

713
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:53,680
crop so the drive I happen slowly over

714
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,329
the course of of four days

715
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,330
so you're going from a water content of

716
00:28:55,329 --> 00:29:01,179
roughly 80% of a new submission of

717
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:03,309
saturation down to 30% and then I'm

718
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,430
giving it a feed and then I'm going Java

719
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:08,259
gamut so this strategy reads roots it

720
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,730
forces those feeder routes to come out

721
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:12,640
and search and the route into the new

722
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:15,460
substrate but after I've done that then

723
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:20,800
I can start using irrigation as a tool

724
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:22,960
to steer growth so once you bring them

725
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,029
to the new substrate then you can apply

726
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,430
the irrigation strategy so for generous

727
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,680
steering you'll want to apply larger

728
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:32,590
fiims of substrate or larger volumes of

729
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,390
irrigation with less frequency so in an

730
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:36,819
ebb and flow system this can consist of

731
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:39,730
flooding higher up the site the block

732
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:41,409
less frequently in drip this can be

733
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,049
accomplished by applying irrigation

734
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:46,660
volumes of 6% of the total substrate

735
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:49,509
size so say I have 1 litre of growing

736
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,390
media I would give it a 6% shot which

737
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:54,549
would be 60 mils the timing of these

738
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,870
irrigations will dictate the dry back so

739
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:58,359
if you wish to have to be more

740
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:59,289
generative you can wait longer to apply

741
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,839
the first year

742
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:04,269
of the day and you'll stop earlier in

743
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,039
the day today several hours before the

744
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:11,049
lights go off to to have an increase dry

745
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:13,299
vac overact this su result in a smaller

746
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:17,109
more compact plant with a better root

747
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:19,389
system inside the block if you want to

748
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:21,969
be more vegetative if you want the

749
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:24,640
plants to grow faster then you want to

750
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,039
apply a more vegetative strategy this is

751
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,900
a conference using smaller irrigations

752
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,519
each typically three percent or less

753
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,110
than the volume of growing media so

754
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,650
again one liter block I would be

755
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:37,329
applying a 30 mil shot or less in flood

756
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,160
systems you'd apply irrigations that

757
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:43,059
just touched the bottom of the block

758
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,620
half inch or less you will stolen to

759
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:46,419
ensure dry vaccine every night between

760
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:49,029
irrigations of at least one to two

761
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,380
percent if you have a sensor of water

762
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:53,019
content sensor that allows you to

763
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:56,890
measure those and drive X overnight of a

764
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:58,329
10 to 15 percent so this would mean you

765
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,580
might end up water earlier in the day

766
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:03,849
all the way throughout the days the

767
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:07,029
plants gonna tip up take water but

768
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:08,949
usually you need to wait for the plants

769
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:10,839
to start to drink before you dare do it

770
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,340
so you do want to let you don't want the

771
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:13,750
lights to come on and immediately start

772
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:15,339
applying water because this will slow

773
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,769
down growth so it's called transpiration

774
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:19,119
before irrigation so once you're able to

775
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:21,670
see that the plants are up taking water

776
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,829
either just you know about looking at it

777
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,420
or you have a sensor and you can start

778
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:30,189
applying this first irrigations of the

779
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:32,950
day this type of irrigation strategy

780
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:37,720
will result in healthy vigorous fast

781
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:43,390
growing plants and yeah just did you did

782
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:45,670
you a faster veg so so how does this

783
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,920
work in practice this chart shows how to

784
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:51,100
apply vegetative and gendered irrigation

785
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:53,950
strategy to grow Dan small blocks so

786
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:56,019
while the maximum wet wait the deep

787
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,940
water content stays the same the dry

788
00:31:56,019 --> 00:32:01,460
weight is almost 100 grams less for

789
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,980
janitor steering the rest time between

790
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,440
is used to steer the plans with long

791
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,180
rest tires between our Dacians for more

792
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,500
vegetative growth while shorter rest

793
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:13,970
periods steer the plants more vegetative

794
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,980
the EC's of the applied irrigation

795
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,650
solutions are adjusted and used to steer

796
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,019
growth so high DC's creating a more

797
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:24,259
generative steer while lorry sees more

798
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:26,779
vegetative climate is also used in

799
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:29,240
conjunction with with irrigation to

800
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:35,500
steer the car and it's just important as

801
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,500
a irrigation strategy almost that

802
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:43,629
so finally that the structures of the

803
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:45,849
plants have a profound effect on uniform

804
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,680
development plants with different

805
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:49,299
numbers of leaves and branches will help

806
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,400
take water at different rates I get this

807
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:53,019
complaint from growers all the time it's

808
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,150
like I have some plans that are really

809
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:56,500
wet sometimes are really dry you know

810
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,970
some of that's a placement within the

811
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,529
room how much light they're getting a

812
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,569
lot of it has to do with that crop

813
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:04,359
structure are they even between the

814
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:08,049
batch so having different numbers of the

815
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:10,240
leaves and branches despite a great

816
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:12,279
excessive leaf removal pinching king

817
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,500
tree uptake inconsistencies in the days

818
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:16,180
calling their applications so when you

819
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,579
do go through and you do remove leaves

820
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,860
you probably have to make an adjustment

821
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:23,319
to your irrigation strategy in the days

822
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:24,849
following that those lethal illness

823
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:28,329
otherwise you're either over the water

824
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:30,279
along with the plants what's pictured

825
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:33,849
here is provided by a seed company

826
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:36,910
selling high-wire cucumbers specifically

827
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:40,539
this this chart here defines how the

828
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:42,220
plants should be delete into in relation

829
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:44,259
to fruit and flower development so as

830
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,880
the fruit is removed a leaf is removed

831
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,250
to keep the plants growing all the same

832
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,980
rate in imbalance so if I'm talking

833
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:53,140
about a 16 hectare to make that up

834
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,460
cucumber farm I want all those plans to

835
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,250
grow at the same rate back to organize

836
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:01,750
my labor plan for my harvest so all my

837
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:03,730
plants have to be exactly the same so in

838
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,009
my opinion heavy deleting and pinching

839
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,210
of cannabis creates a lot of

840
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,918
inconsistencies in the way the plants

841
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:12,510
grow I'm not saying don't remove your

842
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:12,509
leaves by nuts

843
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm just saying you should look at

844
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:19,960
different ways of removing them and

845
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,769
maybe keeping it more balanced where as

846
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,320
opposed to doing all those to be things

847
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:27,630
one day or two days I'm doing it over

848
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,850
the course of several days this keeps

849
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,590
the plants healthy and vigorous they

850
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,839
also keeps you labor labor a little more

851
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,309
happy because by the end of the time at

852
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,620
end of the row they're probably just on

853
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:40,829
autopilot just dripping leaves and it

854
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:43,949
can cause damage to the crops so only

855
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:45,719
through the time and testing only one

856
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:49,619
day be able to have proven strategies

857
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:52,439
like like the chart here for cannabis so

858
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:54,569
very quickly to demonstrate discussing

859
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,250
any significant pinching process can be

860
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,750
on plaintiff element I just won't

861
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,619
discuss some pinchy techniques for

862
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:04,050
tomato so the single headed tomato plant

863
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:08,969
this is an unpopped you know it's very

864
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:11,039
strong it grows very fast you know it's

865
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:12,899
it's it's not typically done because it

866
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,929
requires a lot of climate steering to

867
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,170
keep the plants to bring to talk too

868
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:20,579
fast but I think this may be a good

869
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,409
different structure for campus plants is

870
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,319
you know instead of pinching early we

871
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:28,649
pinch later using pinching as a height

872
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,840
control method but what what needs to

873
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,539
happen is we need to figure out the

874
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,640
exact timing when two spaces bet so a

875
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,230
lot of reasons we can gin canvas is

876
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:38,670
because we were again we had limited

877
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,949
space for our mothers limited space for

878
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,530
cuttings limited space for fetch so we

879
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:46,199
weren't able to transplant and space the

880
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:49,019
veg plants on time so you had to pinch

881
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:51,059
to create the the side branches but if

882
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,489
you have more space and I can say I'm

883
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:56,159
going to space my plants one week out to

884
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:58,439
transplant then I could probably build

885
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:01,949
out the side and lower lower branches

886
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,690
better than taking off the head

887
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:05,250
so the

888
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,500
the other one is the tendency to

889
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,119
transplant on the second leave set so

890
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,838
this is this is the most common one for

891
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,050
tomatoes the second piece of the plant

892
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,369
is the head and the second we just

893
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:21,030
pulled off about 45 days after

894
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:22,769
transplanting out of cutting this plant

895
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:26,910
type is ready to transplant about 55

896
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:29,400
days after you've taken the cut so they

897
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:34,429
use climate and irrigation to control

898
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:38,280
the highlights plants so usually you are

899
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:39,449
keeping the day/night texts even you see

900
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,950
actually manipulating day night

901
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:42,539
difference of a bigger difference

902
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,098
between day and night the more stretch

903
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,108
out yet so if I want a less stretching

904
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,880
plan I can keep the temperatures even

905
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:49,980
this also helps with Smita tea control

906
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,780
so instead of dropping the temperature

907
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,730
is and then creating dewpoint I can keep

908
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,560
the temperature even have a higher

909
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,050
humidity a nighttime temperature which

910
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:02,009
really helps for climate control and

911
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:04,619
then finally finished on the first set

912
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,930
of truly is this this is for primarily

913
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:08,970
seeds I would not necessarily recommend

914
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:12,419
this for cannabis but it's an

915
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:14,578
interesting it's an interesting crop to

916
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,619
pinch it now you have two headed plant

917
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,890
they're all growing at the exact same

918
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:24,660
rate and now I've had a lot of control

919
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:26,969
the truck here sort of shows this when

920
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,098
to apply my things Asia developed arts

921
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:31,348
like this when do I when do I do my

922
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:34,200
first pinch when do I space the plants

923
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:36,838
in bed and then what kind of climate and

924
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,588
irrigation strategies do I need to use

925
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:42,639
to control the plant type thank you

926
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:44,199
season so in closing uniformity starts

927
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,348
with mothers cuttings and in the veg

928
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:49,058
phase consistent initial saturation

929
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:51,940
irrigation climate help maintain that

930
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:53,469
uniformity planting densities from

931
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,450
mother's cuttings and the later growth

932
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:56,950
stages need to be optimized to build the

933
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:59,228
most uniform crop structures possible

934
00:37:56,949 --> 00:38:01,838
with the least amount of labor and

935
00:37:59,228 --> 00:38:03,998
energy climate and irrigation stirring

936
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:07,058
should be applied used that everything

937
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:08,738
at every stage of growth from mothers

938
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:11,859
cuttings veg and throughout the

939
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:13,150
flowering cycle and lastly pruning has a

940
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:15,098
powerful effect on how the plants

941
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:19,809
develop and is a primary tool for

942
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:20,200
maintaining uniformity yeah all right

943
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:21,940
great

944
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:23,048
so we've got about five minutes for a

945
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,818
couple questions if you've got a

946
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:26,170
question put your hand up while I'm

947
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:28,179
getting to you I've got one for you

948
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,969
they're going so you're saying that the

949
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:33,190
studies said data and having more leaves

950
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:35,048
when you do your cutting is going to

951
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,599
actually be beneficial for the plant is

952
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:39,880
there a a high end of that where where

953
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,588
are the plant that we're pulling is too

954
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,930
big and it's going to put too much

955
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:46,449
pressure on the other root formation

956
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:49,719
that's the only tested three and four

957
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:51,399
leaf sets they did not test bigger

958
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:53,469
plants but not something interesting I

959
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,298
hope to look at that this year and I

960
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:56,889
have taken longer cuttings I'm sure

961
00:38:55,298 --> 00:38:58,659
people here taking longer cuttings as

962
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:00,190
well so I think it's something to

963
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:03,429
explore what is what is the ideal

964
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,599
cannabis cutting length I don't think

965
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:06,399
anyone's really defined that we have

966
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,170
everybody doing different things until

967
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,818
people have the scientific data I've

968
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,298
done the Charles themselves and if you

969
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:15,748
probably will verify the variety of

970
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:15,748
cannabis

971
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:26,019
did you know the diameter of the Cuddy

972
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,430
on stem diameter no nothing's been done

973
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:30,130
yet on the stem thing already

974
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:31,359
I have to see that stuff but I think

975
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,670
makes it would make a difference

976
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,870
obviously you know or you know where

977
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,250
where it comes from the plant they

978
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,170
didn't study where it came from the

979
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,400
plant okay whether top companies or

980
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,809
bottom cuttings were better and they

981
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,289
found that there was really no

982
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:48,639
difference between the top of the bottom

983
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:53,259
it's not a question prior pension system

984
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:54,940
eight oh I dumped into a dozen I wasn't

985
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,050
sure if we be deal with cannabis when

986
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,800
the plant gets a little bit bigger

987
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:04,120
actually just this one

988
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,490
Yeah right there those are planted down

989
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:10,869
into the medium to create more freedom

990
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:12,669
do you think cannabis good I think you

991
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:15,219
can't do this I think this is for me is

992
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,990
really would make weaker cannabis plants

993
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:18,819
and know it makes weaker tomato plants

994
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:21,159
overall that these these plants are more

995
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,750
weak and this is not that the one that's

996
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:24,969
used anymore I've seen it done on

997
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,769
cannabis it's just I don't think it's

998
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:29,709
the right way and I think it's either on

999
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:31,809
top or a late top plant so it's like

1000
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:35,199
because most people are using toffee has

1001
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:36,639
a method for pretty side branches but

1002
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,529
also for height control these that I've

1003
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,539
let the plant grow on top it's gonna be

1004
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:45,160
a massive plant so it's question do I

1005
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:47,320
top into vet or do I top mid 4 meter

1006
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:50,319
sweet flower second a flower or do i top

1007
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:54,850
at a height so I think that's something

1008
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,440
that needs to be explained how can you

1009
00:40:54,849 --> 00:41:01,210
use mother's floor before you have to

1010
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:03,519
flow them into flower I mean keep people

1011
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:06,010
to keep you mothers for years but it

1012
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:07,630
seems like after after 3 to 4 months the

1013
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:10,480
the success rates of the cuttings

1014
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,190
declines rapidly I mean I think we

1015
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,079
really don't know what diseases and

1016
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,670
viruses affect cannabis and because it's

1017
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,309
such a resilient plant and it's

1018
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:19,510
resistant to so much that you wouldn't

1019
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,840
know that there's something wrong with

1020
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:24,790
it

1021
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:27,210
you know I wasn't there so I guess we do

1022
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:27,210
have good morning

1023
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:40,239
so in lesson 9 easy dumps to dismiss

1024
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:45,069
different looks with different lighting

1025
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:47,469
and humidity to adjust their communities

1026
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:49,330
humidity tents so I mean it depends on

1027
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:50,739
what your grow room setup is it's hard

1028
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:54,190
it's hard because we've all designed our

1029
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:57,309
rings around domes and trays you know

1030
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:59,710
for the chrysanthemum farms they have a

1031
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:02,679
tray that hasn't built in kind of

1032
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:05,559
structure that would support a tarp so

1033
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,940
do I make a mini hoop overtop of today

1034
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:08,529
can't put it over top of your rack

1035
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,659
because now you're catching all that

1036
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:12,820
heat in there and you're gonna melt your

1037
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:15,009
cuttings so you have to figure out a way

1038
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,600
to insulate the trays from possibly the

1039
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,420
lights below and then maybe just a mini

1040
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,889
hoop and then a plastic view over top

1041
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:27,010
just to keep them moisture away from the

1042
00:42:20,889 --> 00:42:30,879
leaf tips the last question here when is

1043
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:33,460
it too late to take our take our tops

1044
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,650
anymore because we've moved too far in

1045
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,510
the flowering process and the hormones

1046
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,480
are starting to gather at the top to

1047
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:43,360
form flowers and if we actually take the

1048
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,019
cutting at that point we will actually

1049
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:50,320
be impeding future flower which I'm I

1050
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:53,259
taking cuttings are window.top well if

1051
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,360
if someone's trying to do this for wave

1052
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,380
control acts right that's a good

1053
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,059
question I don't know and I think it

1054
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,220
depends on the variety because you know

1055
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:02,799
some varieties will stretch a lot more

1056
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:04,539
than others so I think that's it's a

1057
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,980
variety dependent thing I think that's

1058
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:08,230
why it's a crop registration is

1059
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:10,420
important because I don't think there's

1060
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,730
we've so far seem to be applying the

1061
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,470
same strategy to all cannabis plants but

1062
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,909
they're all different they're all

1063
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:17,989
significantly different terms of height

1064
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:20,779
development and stretching and how

1065
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:22,819
you know so I think it's it's specific

1066
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,540
to variety they're not right now let's

1067
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,539
put our hands together for

1068
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:29,549
[Applause]

1069
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:36,969
you
