3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,120
things that you could be doing so I'm

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,199
glad that you are here uh thanks to Dave

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,798
for the kind introduction and thanks

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:17,559
also to Eric Norton and his team from

7
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,039
imperious Expo um not only for creating

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,960
this opportunity for us all to get

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,599
together and strengthen our scene um but

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,439
also for this opportunity to speak to

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:26,679
you this

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,240
morning so there's no doubt that

13
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:32,799
cannabis is an exceptionally high risk

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,558
uh business for entrepreneurs and and

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,078
yet we've all been attracted to this

16
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:39,878
industry like a moth to light right I

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,679
mean we're all here and we're feeling

18
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:42,960
passionate about it and we pride

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,159
ourselves on participating in this

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,679
industry that is one part patient care

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,198
one part booming green rush and let's

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,280
face it one part taboo and sticking it

23
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,640
to the man right so our industry is a

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,640
tornado and and yet here we are it's

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,799
it's filled with risk it gets Messier

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,798
every day and here we are feeling

27
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,399
passionate about it and taking those

28
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:08,799
risks so during my short keynote today

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,400
we're going to consider this dichotomy

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,280
of the mess and the risk and also why we

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,280
feel so driven to be

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,359
here for newcomers to the industry it'll

33
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,079
be consideration of the risks and

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,879
benefits of participating in this new

35
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,839
cannabis industry and perhaps a warning

36
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,118
of some new surprises that may come

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,960
along when Arizona legalizes adult use

38
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,159
in 2018

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,599
and for others who have been in the

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,479
industry a bit longer it will provide

41
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,798
some laughs about our shared struggle up

42
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:41,438
to this point so first let's start with

43
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,439
the risks let's look at what we're

44
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,398
really talking about here well first and

45
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,039
foremost what we hear from people all

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,519
through the uh the Expo this weekend is

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,640
people are afraid of running out of

48
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,359
money one of the questions that we hear

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,079
out on in the panels is that people are

50
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,959
like I know I've got raised this much

51
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,839
money I need to do everything I need to

52
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,280
do for that amount of money and yet the

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,118
numbers often don't uh pencil out that

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,878
is a very significant risk you're an

55
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,280
entrepreneur you've put it all on the

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,719
line and your money is quickly draining

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,120
away another risk though is that you can

58
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,439
have an otherwise solid business model

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,319
you can be an entrepreneur who's

60
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,800
practiced in business and coming from

61
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:26,958
another industry and do everything right

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,080
and yet your state and local taxes can

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,000
eat up the profit that you have and what

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,080
you're used to excluding with your taxes

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,959
because of the 28 issues eats into your

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,920
profits so you can do everything right

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
and still lose because you're not

68
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,919
generating the appropriate

69
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,479
profit not only that but cannabis

70
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,518
business partners make strange bed

71
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,039
fellows it is incredibly common across

72
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,840
the country for people to get together

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,400
decide over smok in a bowl that they're

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,280
going to start a business together and

75
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,239
then everything goes aide just because

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,640
you're good toking Partners just because

77
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,599
your neighbors just because you like to

78
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,919
serve together just because you like to

79
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,238
hike together does not make for good

80
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:12,759
business partners especially when it's

81
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,799
very likely that one or neither of the

82
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,959
business partners has any business

83
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,959
experience they just think they know

84
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,640
weed these are very real risks and these

85
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,640
are not risks that we generally run into

86
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,119
in other Industries because in other

87
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,479
Industries there's usually some sort of

88
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,879
Journeymen capacity right where you

89
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,119
you've started uh as a newbie or an

90
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,759
intern and you become an admin assistant

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,920
and then you work your way up and then

92
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,000
and then you you know get some middle

93
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,639
management experience and then you break

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,878
off and you start your own company well

95
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,839
everybody who's doing that was

96
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,798
Prohibition era and most of the people

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,878
in prohibition era may or may not have

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,000
much experience with the sales cycle

99
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,759
with HR with handling the finances and

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,199
so what we've got is a whole bunch of

101
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,239
people who are starting businesses on

102
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,318
passion personal faith and quite

103
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,200
possibly

104
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,199
the money of their

105
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,319
neighbor let's also be aware of the high

106
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,719
risk there is that a landlord changed

107
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:14,560
their mind we see this all over the

108
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:17,238
place we all experience the pressure

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,040
right from our friends and family um to

110
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,238
some degree about going into cannabis I

111
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,720
can't tell you how many times I've heard

112
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,399
the story from Cannabis entrepreneurs

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,960
who were talking to me and they said you

114
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,638
know I knew that cannabis was going to

115
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,120
be a real [ __ ] you know I knew that I

116
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,240
had to give it my all I knew I was

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,240
signing up for 7day work weeks I

118
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,319
understand this is startup but I did not

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,280
expect the the parents of my children's

120
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:43,000
friends to no longer let their kids come

121
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,079
over to my house I did not expect that

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,759
the pastor at my church was going to

123
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,639
take me aside and saying what are you

124
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,199
doing to the children of our

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,759
Parish I did not expect that you know

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,280
the local shopkeeper that that I

127
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,240
normally work with every day would just

128
00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:00,399
like start making these uncool comments

129
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,120
about the business that we're in and yet

130
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,799
we as cannabis entrepreneurs we

131
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,120
experience this regularly and the more

132
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,478
you come out which essentially means the

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,038
more success you have the more likely

134
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,719
that this is going to happen and so that

135
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:18,318
delineates the the the last risk in this

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,080
section SE section which is

137
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:25,840
divorce it is incredibly common for any

138
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:30,560
new startup to put an insane amount of

139
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:32,679
pressure on a marriage and even if both

140
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,280
people in the marriage are part of the

141
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,918
Cannabis company and maybe sometimes

142
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,159
even more if they are it puts pressure

143
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,879
on all of our relationships our time

144
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,160
with our kids go down our time with our

145
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,879
spouse can sometimes go down and if you

146
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,639
work with your spouse your off time

147
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,399
you're often talking about how to have

148
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,360
the canvas company not

149
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,120
crash it is astonishing as I travel the

150
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,080
country to talk to in the different rep

151
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,319
states to hear people say yeah well I

152
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,758
have a lot more time now to invest in my

153
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,319
company because I'm separated from my

154
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,680
significant other these are all very

155
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,360
significant risks and yet all of the

156
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,840
risks that I've given you so far um are

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,960
things that can happen to any startup

158
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,439
it's just um turned up to 11 when it

159
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,959
comes to

160
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:24,240
cannabis so then let's talk about the

161
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,239
Cannabis specific

162
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,240
risks one of the most common is that you

163
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,918
have put together this fantastic IC plan

164
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,160
for a marijuana grow and you have got

165
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,079
your strains all figured out and you

166
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,840
know you're getting your genetics and

167
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,639
you are ready to go but then there's a

168
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,560
hitch right and it changes from state to

169
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,280
state but it kind of smells like you

170
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,038
didn't win the lottery to get a license

171
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,119
or perhaps you didn't get approved for

172
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,199
some crazy reason that they may not even

173
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,319
tell you because most of these decisions

174
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,639
are made in a black box of

175
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:01,120
bureaucracy and then you know also maybe

176
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,120
they have um maybe you're misreading a

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,079
felony that you used to have maybe it's

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,038
for producing cannabis and now you're

179
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,038
trying to go legit you're going to leave

180
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,800
your black market days behind you and

181
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,478
bring your excellent skills to the legal

182
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,038
market and they're like eh you know we

183
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:16,598
know that the laws say that that we're

184
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,560
not supposed to look at those but but

185
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,639
you know we're still going to put

186
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,959
somebody else in line in front of you

187
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,720
these are all risks and these are risks

188
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,198
that affect us every day and are become

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,720
a part of our Lives because we're

190
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,800
choosing in to this high-risk industry

191
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,720
another specific risk that comes a lot

192
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,400
with cannabis is the guy or the gal who

193
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,039
had all this money and was going to fund

194
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,598
your program suddenly does not have all

195
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:46,158
the money that was going to fund your

196
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,478
program and we all know right we're

197
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,360
certainly not getting Bank uh bank loans

198
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,439
to start our businesses so that means

199
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,158
okay where's your money going to come

200
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,038
from either somehow you were magically

201
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,319
independently wealthy and you are going

202
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,279
to make a big beted on cannabis or

203
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,120
perhaps you got some some friends that

204
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,839
you you know play sports with or your

205
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,519
neighbors or they're at your church or

206
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,839
wherever and you talk to them and

207
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,318
they're all like they see dollar signs

208
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,918
of the magical green rush and they're

209
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,680
like I don't want to be left behind I

210
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,839
remember when I missed Google right and

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,360
they're like trying they wanted like

212
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,079
they wanted they want to prove the world

213
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,919
right this time they want to they want

214
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,598
to uh they want to show that they they

215
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,240
they smelled the money when it was

216
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,719
happening and so they tell you I've got

217
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,680
this money I'm selling my this other

218
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,720
business I'm selling this painting I'm

219
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
selling whatever I'm I'm getting I'm

220
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,038
getting inheritance there's a good one

221
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,158
too and they tell you you can have all

222
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:39,598
of it for your business so you start

223
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,838
work so you go ahead and you start

224
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,759
banking all of this work and you and you

225
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,720
start putting in seven days a week and

226
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,519
you st start to make promises to your

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,120
allies you start reaching out and making

228
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,799
new networking friends all on the idea

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,959
that you're creating this inertia and

230
00:08:53,799 --> 00:09:00,159
then when that check is received and

231
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,278
transferred to you you're ready to go

232
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,639
go then the day comes you've got

233
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,200
everything all set

234
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:10,000
up you're calling them you're ready you

235
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,079
know you know the the the the the we're

236
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,720
ready to build it we're ready to put the

237
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:17,319
order in for the parts from China we're

238
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,399
ready to sign a lease and you know they

239
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,839
don't get back to you for 3 days a week

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,200
and you realize that the person that you

241
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,760
were depending on for the Lynch pin of

242
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,839
your business plan has evaporated and

243
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,679
they're embarrassed so they don't want

244
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,320
to talk to you and it really doesn't

245
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,078
matter at this point what their excuse

246
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,560
is or what their reason is because it's

247
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:39,679
already done and all the work that you

248
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,639
put in your seven days a week is flushed

249
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,519
out this is depressing stuff and we all

250
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,559
know that we see it all around us in

251
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,839
this scene there are more companies that

252
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,599
are vaporware than there are actual

253
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,519
companies in our industry at this point

254
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,079
and we all really hope that we're not

255
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,720
going to be the one but we also happen

256
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:01,439
to know that it can happen to anybody

257
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,440
cuz we've seen iten to good folks so

258
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
even outside of maybe things in your

259
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,720
business plan you know all over the

260
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,399
country as as cannabis legalization is

261
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,399
getting more real and more tangible a

262
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,919
lot of counties are just freaking out

263
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,440
and establishing

264
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:21,439
moratoriums so suddenly out of nowhere

265
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,160
where you live is no longer allowing

266
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,000
cannabis growing cannabis companies

267
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,799
cannabis retail and they just they you

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,839
know nine people on your local County

269
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:35,599
Board suddenly makes the change like

270
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,680
that I'm still not perfectly clear how

271
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,200
in the world a state can legalize

272
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,120
marijuana and a county can then say

273
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,079
except here it just seems wrong to me

274
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,360
but it happens all the time Oregon

275
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:51,919
Washington California and I'm assuming

276
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,919
it's happening here in

277
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,879
Arizona but if it's not as you move

278
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,199
towards recreational and people start to

279
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,720
see the difference between medical and

280
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,759
recreational they just start to smell a

281
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,680
different vibe I'd say that you can

282
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,000
expect

283
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:10,599
it you can also be expected that

284
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,639
neighbors of grows will start doing

285
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,278
whatever they can to kind of push your

286
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,759
buttons and push you out you

287
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,838
know in the city it's challenging and

288
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,679
important to uh make sure that your

289
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,760
exhaust doesn't smell like Candace right

290
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,359
Alpha and beta pining has got a smell to

291
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,319
it that not a lot of people are familiar

292
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,879
with or if they are they're Amar with it

293
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,040
and they either well probably like most

294
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:37,399
of us like who's smoking the day right

295
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,919
and for us it smells good but for a lot

296
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,559
of people they smell that and it smells

297
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,199
like the bad guys it smells like the

298
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,518
criminals and they don't want that smell

299
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
anywhere near their house and so if you

300
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,000
live in the city and you're growing

301
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,919
indoors in a warehouse you need to darn

302
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,879
sure that your scrubbers are intact so

303
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,639
that you're not smelling up the

304
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:58,120
neighborhood but similarly where I live

305
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,519
on Vashon Island you know we only have

306
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,679
agriculturally zoned property The

307
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,159
Growers on our Island figured we're good

308
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,199
to go you know people have got cows

309
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:09,679
people are growing all sorts of crops it

310
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,160
should be safe here as far as smells go

311
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,000
because we've got 5 10 15 acres and that

312
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,600
shouldn't be a problem and yet you have

313
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,360
neighbors who just don't care for

314
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,639
cannabis maybe morally or maybe they

315
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,600
think it has something to do with their

316
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,120
kids and so they just start filing

317
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,839
little grievances with the County Board

318
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,039
they turn you in they say oh I smell

319
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,040
this aw stink when maybe they smelled it

320
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,919
once on a sunny day during your Bloom

321
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:39,958
cycle and it wafted their way sometimes

322
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:42,799
they it's not even about the the reality

323
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,278
of it it's about their reaction to it

324
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,519
this is another risk that we have to

325
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,919
deal

326
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,720
with and finally the last one in this

327
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,519
section is especially appropriate

328
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,079
Arizona there's a risk that some giant

329
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,480
pharmaceutical firm puts its thumbs on

330
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,198
the scale of democracy and plunges a

331
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,600
half million to influence a state

332
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,679
election so they can pedal more opiates

333
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,959
and try and Corner the market on

334
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,319
cannabis before it gets legalized with

335
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,159
the

336
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,360
people we all know that cannabis is

337
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:17,000
going to get legalized properly in 2018

338
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,600
but it's a shame that corporations can

339
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,759
put that kind of money into what is

340
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,159
essentially a local election and tip the

341
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,319
scales of Justice towards corporate

342
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:31,120
greed instead of thinking about

343
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,120
individual rights and patient

344
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,838
needs finally

345
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,198
raids now if your first thought was

346
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,000
raids we don't have them they're not in

347
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:45,278
my neighborhood and they're unlikely I

348
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,720
got to tell you you need to be prepared

349
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,720
for it it does not take a lot for rates

350
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,278
to begin in your local area because when

351
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,480
you think about it what we are doing is

352
00:13:54,278 --> 00:14:00,120
diametrically opposed to the income of

353
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,680
traditional law enforcement now it's

354
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,320
certainly true that there is a great

355
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,078
deal of law enforcement that supports

356
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,839
legalization for a variety of reasons

357
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,838
but we also know especially in small

358
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,920
towns there are local sheriffs and

359
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,560
others with a chip on their shoulder who

360
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,639
see this as some sort of loss and they

361
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:24,679
are looking for a way to retaliate and

362
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,680
they want to buy their new gear and they

363
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,800
love coming into your business and

364
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,839
capturing all of your gear

365
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,599
so all you had to do all you have to do

366
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,160
in a lot of places in the country is

367
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,720
simply piss somebody off whether it's a

368
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,439
local sheriff a councilman who has some

369
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,480
influence some midlevel bureaucratic

370
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,880
jerk who demands some ridiculous permit

371
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,959
that you just say you know this is a tax

372
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,958
that you're putting on me locally which

373
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:55,278
is not justified based on the state law

374
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:58,278
and yet locally they make this permit

375
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:01,320
and so they're essentially extorting you

376
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:04,039
any of these people that I'm describing

377
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,879
can give the green light for a raid to

378
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,360
happen on your property and you know I'm

379
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,958
not saying it's necessarily a violent

380
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,600
raid but I'm saying that anytime someone

381
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:17,078
comes to your property in swat gear and

382
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,360
yelling that sounds like emotional

383
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:21,638
violence to

384
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,600
me you could just be laate on your taxes

385
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,480
you know a lot of folks are laate on

386
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,879
their taxes a lot of people are really

387
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,159
late on their business taxes but when it

388
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,480
comes to cannabis ta taxes we have to

389
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,000
meet a different standard I know of

390
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
jurisdictions in California where if

391
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,919
you're laid down your taxes just like

392
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,399
you know three four business days they

393
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:43,198
know that since you can't use Banks

394
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,120
you're sitting on cash at your place of

395
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:49,399
business and they know now they've got a

396
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,480
reason that'll stand up in court to why

397
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,799
they can come to your

398
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,680
property force their way into your safe

399
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,439
capture your money and then make you

400
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:01,838
fight them to receive it back and God

401
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,000
help you if you've got some nice CO2

402
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,240
extraction equipment well they'll take

403
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
that as well and then you're down

404
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,959
another six figures for that plus if

405
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,399
you're an extractor that way well put

406
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,078
you out of business because you may not

407
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,120
have another 100K to pick it up get it

408
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:20,318
installed and and um and get all the

409
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,318
necessarily finishing technology as

410
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,919
well there's also the possibility of X

411
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,240
employee trash talk so maybe you have an

412
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,360
employee that worked out for a little

413
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,759
while but you know canvas companies kind

414
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
of go through employees pretty fast and

415
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,039
you know they leave with a chip on their

416
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,360
shoulder and they kind of want to throw

417
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,958
you under to the bus so they go to that

418
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,199
sheriff that councilman that person who

419
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,119
gives the permit and they said you know

420
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,439
what they're violating this rule this

421
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,519
Rule and this

422
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,920
rule that is often enough to cause a

423
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,600
raate on your property when they should

424
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,838
totally just send somebody a permitting

425
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,480
officer to check it out but when it

426
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,519
comes to cannabis people jump the gun

427
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,839
they go right from questioning to we're

428
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,759
bringing in with the guns in the flag

429
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,880
jacket and I had thought about that for

430
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,000
a while why is this why do they go from

431
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,959
Zer to 100 so fast and it's because the

432
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,798
bureaucracy still considers us scrims

433
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,120
they are assuming that we've got weapons

434
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,318
they are assuming that we are going to

435
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,239
resist they are res assuming that they

436
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:25,798
have to be protecting their lives and

437
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,120
with time this will go away because I

438
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,679
don't see a whole lot of violent people

439
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,439
in this room we're just normal folks

440
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,960
we're normal folks who are excited about

441
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,038
something and we want to

442
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,679
participate but that's not how everybody

443
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:41,440
sees

444
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,038
us it's okay to be cautious about going

445
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,480
into cannabis and you know it's probably

446
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,240
really smart before you go in a cannabis

447
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,319
you should have a real heart-to-heart

448
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,960
talk with your family spend some time

449
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:54,480
thinking about what your risk tolerance

450
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,200
is you know you cannot be brave or

451
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,880
courageous though with some amount of

452
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,960
fear and everybody in this room who is

453
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,039
has chosen to start a cannabis company

454
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,240
is exhibiting courage because we are

455
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:09,759
moving in the direction that history

456
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,798
supports even though a lot of those in

457
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,798
power don't yet recognize

458
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,038
it entrepreneurs and other Industries

459
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,679
they try to equate themselves with us

460
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,279
but Canabis entrepreneurs are their own

461
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,200
breed and like no one else you how we

462
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,678
cannot even use the bank

463
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,600
what is an entrepreneur without a bank

464
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,400
and checks and the ability move cash

465
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,158
around and develop cash flow we have

466
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,080
none of that and yet entrepreneurs in

467
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,880
other Industries say to us oh you know I

468
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:46,439
could do that if I wanted to no you love

469
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,919
your security too much you are not risk

470
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,640
tolerant in this way and you don't care

471
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:57,480
about the plan we are

472
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,720
different we are odd we're Fringe we're

473
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,480
dreamers even even if you're a suit wear

474
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,519
and finance person with an MBA if you

475
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,360
are in cannabis you're still an oddball

476
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,599
Fringe dreamer to show up in cannabis

477
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,439
and dive into all of this risk and find

478
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:17,038
joy in it doesn't matter where you come

479
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,640
from the fact that you are here means

480
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:22,558
you're part of this new

481
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,960
community all right so now that we've

482
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,240
covered all the depressing stuff that

483
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,720
makes a second guess why we're even here

484
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,679
today let's talk about why we're here

485
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,319
here

486
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:37,720
today the title of this talk today is

487
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:41,200
risky business why we choose

488
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,600
cannabis we're here because we choose to

489
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,919
participate we choose to be courageous

490
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,918
in the face of messy

491
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,319
laws unsteady

492
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,319
enforcement and the Judgment that we get

493
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:58,839
from our community sometimes so for all

494
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,119
of this risk and potential headache what

495
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:04,279
are these rewards that keep us deeply

496
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:07,199
involved and working 7 days a week and

497
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:09,319
potentially risking all of our

498
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,640
savings you know this answer is

499
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,200
different for everybody but there are

500
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,520
certainly some common

501
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,558
things number

502
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:22,480
one and most important to me we are

503
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,399
healing humans it's as simple as that we

504
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,960
are self-empowering and choosing to do

505
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
the good thing we have chosen to be on

506
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,000
the right side of history and make

507
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,919
cannabis happen where we live we choose

508
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,279
to work our asses off in order to

509
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,720
relieve the suffering of our fellow

510
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:46,359
human now in states that are still P

511
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,759
purely medical that is the primary

512
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,599
conversation that happs how are we going

513
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,519
to help patients but I got to tell you

514
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:55,959
by living in and visiting other wck

515
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:59,359
states that gets lost awfully fast as

516
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,840
soon as the W Market comes and it splits

517
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,079
our scene there are schisms in our scene

518
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,558
between people who are in it because

519
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,119
they cared about the plant and they want

520
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:10,798
to heal humans and people who smelled

521
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:12,558
money and moved into the new industry

522
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,720
they were in Tech and then they were in

523
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,079
real estate and now they're in

524
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,440
weed I'm not really faulting these

525
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,599
people but they're different than us

526
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,278
they're different than the people who

527
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:29,278
are into it because we can help heal

528
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:31,440
each other number two it's just fun

529
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,679
the Cannabis industry is the best

530
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,880
industry I have ever been in and I'm one

531
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,440
of those people who

532
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,000
did Tech the doom boom and real

533
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,360
estate I was a cannabis Enthusiast the

534
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,919
entire time and I was educating those

535
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,240
around me about how to heal themselves

536
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,559
with cannabis but I also wasn't really

537
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,960
all that interested in going to

538
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:58,240
prison the community we have created is

539
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,880
funloving our events are way better than

540
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,440
any other industry and how great is it

541
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,880
to be able to get together at events

542
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,798
like this get together compare business

543
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,039
strategies share best practices teach

544
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,440
each other about extraction technology

545
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,119
talk about our favorite strains trade

546
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,720
genetics and then go up to the roof of

547
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:21,119
the hotel and totally get

548
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,960
bait we are funloving people and even

549
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,079
though you know I'm in a suit today

550
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,919
because it's kind of the role I'm

551
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,519
playing as panel moderator and

552
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,440
delivering the keynote to you today

553
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:33,839
we're probably the only industry where

554
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,759
we can dress like this and still be

555
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,879
considered professionals it's a damn

556
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:40,679
good time to be in the Cannabis industry

557
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,480
and that holds a lot of weight

558
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:46,159
especially if you've ever done time in a

559
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,079
blue chip company or in a cubicle or

560
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,080
working for some

561
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,200
jerk another reason is that for many of

562
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,720
us this is a dream come true right I

563
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,000
mean think back to when the first times

564
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,880
you were smoking with your friends it's

565
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,640
a summer afternoon and you're all high

566
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,760
and laying on the grass and looking at

567
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,520
the sky and joking about when you be

568
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,359
great someday to move somewhere warm and

569
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,639
you we'll just grow weed and we'll have

570
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,558
a really good life right sometimes

571
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,799
you're fantasizing about you know living

572
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:20,240
in Humble County maybe it's Hawaii

573
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:22,558
that's a real popular one but you know

574
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,599
since we're here in Arizona this pretty

575
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,839
boss too I can see people fantasizing

576
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,959
about moving here and growing as well

577
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:34,158
the point is is that that growing

578
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,720
cannabis is filled with ideals that

579
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,799
encourage

580
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,400
Community positive relationships within

581
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,720
people and many people's ideals and

582
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,440
dreams of fantasies about what life can

583
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,440
look like fit right in line with growing

584
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,960
cannabis so not only is growing cannabis

585
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,600
and being in the industry fun and it's

586
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,360
been a dream come true for many of us

587
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,879
it's also

588
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:07,240
cool and cool to a certain extent is the

589
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,760
Judgment of other people because we can

590
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,400
know we're cool but it's different

591
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,558
because I love when I tell people that I

592
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,440
work in cannabis so often their response

593
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,200
contains a little bit of awe and I know

594
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,558
you've had that experience right because

595
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,519
when people find out you work in

596
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:26,240
cannabis you can decide you see this

597
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,879
thing in their eyes where they're like a

598
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,640
they never really thought that somebody

599
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,799
who looks like like you might be in

600
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,799
cannabis or that they thought you did

601
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:37,079
this other thing but more than anything

602
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,720
you can almost feel a little bit of

603
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:42,599
jealousy because you are following your

604
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,798
passion and you're choosing to like we

605
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:46,599
said earlier kind of Stick it to the Man

606
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:50,319
a little

607
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,918
bit which leads me to my last one

608
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,879
another reason why it's great to work in

609
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,960
cannabis is simply because it's taboo

610
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,278
you know everybody in this room feels

611
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,120
and identifies a little bit with being a

612
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,480
rebel with a cause a bad boy or a bad

613
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,278
girl right we are giving the finger to

614
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,759
the man and maybe her parents and

615
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:12,798
certainly the whole structure of our

616
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,599
society who has told us for years that

617
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:19,000
good people don't smoke

618
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,959
marijuana yes yes we do and we're going

619
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,640
into

620
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,038
business and finally number

621
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,320
six even though there's all the risks

622
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,558
that I already delineated and that's a

623
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,200
lot of risk and you really have to have

624
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:37,278
an insane amount of risk awareness and

625
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,600
comfort with risk to even go down this

626
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:43,519
path but if you do in addition to it

627
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:46,000
being fun and enjoying yourself and

628
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,398
helping patients and being cooler than

629
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,480
your friends there's a chance there's a

630
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:55,119
chance that you can make some

631
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,159
money the challenge with that though is

632
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,798
that we all know from states that are

633
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,520
already into this that the mark are

634
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:04,038
tight and a lot of it's eaten up by

635
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,960
taxes and yet there's that promise of

636
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:10,278
being first and we've seen how being a

637
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,558
first mover in Industry can equate into

638
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:14,839
large sums of money down the line and

639
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,759
you know sometimes it doesn't even have

640
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:21,278
to be large sums of money sometimes it

641
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,879
can just be making enough to get by but

642
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,640
doing it in a way that you can feel

643
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,000
proud of maybe tons of money will come

644
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,960
down the line but but maybe that's a

645
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,759
long-term goal maybe you're just glad to

646
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,880
be taking part in righteous living and

647
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,119
righteous income and feel that you're

648
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,480
living your life with honor and wanting

649
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,199
to help patience and move the ball down

650
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,640
the

651
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,319
field so in

652
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,080
summary

653
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:55,519
cannabis is sketchy and risky and mean

654
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,480
people play

655
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:01,480
dirty the risks that I've delineated are

656
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,919
not new to any of you and there's as

657
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,640
much luck involved as there is skill to

658
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,559
having success in cannabis and you may

659
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,600
need to try several several times to

660
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,639
find the right situation or company or

661
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,359
business partners before hitting the

662
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,240
right

663
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:22,839
opportunity but I'll tell you

664
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,599
this it's the best game in town and for

665
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:27,959
many it's the only game in town we get

666
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,839
to help patients and we get to be cocky

667
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,798
love Breakers at the same time and we

668
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:39,199
just might make money so dream big help

669
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:42,918
your neighbor make smart moves and enjoy

670
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,159
this building process every damn day

671
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:48,000
because today is the only day we know we

672
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:53,080
have and building a cannabis business is

673
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,079
an honorable Pursuit thank you
