4
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:18,879

animates me for inviting me to come to

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,210
speak with you today I'm Sheng colos I

9
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:37,189
am the host of the shaping fire podcast

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,609
I'm also the founder of the bash on

11
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:43,399
Island Marijuana entrepreneurs Alliance

12
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:45,379
we work on - one Island to find new

13
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,600
channels for product for our medical

14
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,670
growers which is now wrapped up but the

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,160
the organization's still exist as an

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,469
educational organization I'm also a

17
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,808
former brand strategist and then CEO of

18
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:59,359
Green Line farms and I'm a longtime

19
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:03,799
canvas business consultant for both

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,349
medical and 502 so the point of the talk

21
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:09,109
today is going to be to suggest a

22
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:11,599
strategy that you can use to find a job

23
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:13,989
in cannabis that is not the same

24
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,269
strategy that everybody else is using

25
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:19,759
one thing that that works in life but

26
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:22,009
also especially works well when looking

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,290
for a job is find out what everybody

28
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,780
else is doing and then do something else

29
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,299
because everybody else is doing that one

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,090
strategy and so whatever sex success

31
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,759
there is to be had from that strategy is

32
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,710
probably going to be taken advantage of

33
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,500
by somebody else so simply because of

34
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:41,030
the numbers so we're gonna start in a

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,890
really kind of an odd place we're going

36
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,228
to start with are you sure you want a

37
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,109
job in cannabis and obviously if you're

38
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:49,489
here you're pretty sure that you do but

39
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:52,280
we're going to go through this because

40
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:54,069
part of the idea of it talk today is

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,140
that we're going to leverage your

42
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:59,328
passion for working in cannabis to get a

43
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,618
job and so by going through this quick

44
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,618
little exercise will

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,750
right alright so so first of all um if

46
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,549
you really want to work in canvas

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,348
because you've got to be passionate

48
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,360
about it because when it comes right

49
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,669
down to it working in cannabis is

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,580
working at a start-up and working at

51
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:19,349
startups is really hard it's not like a

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,930
normal job where you you know you can

53
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,849
punch in and punch out you know when

54
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,069
you're gonna get paid you've got some

55
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,169
stability we don't have any of that in

56
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,000
the cannabis industry yet and and you

57
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:32,098
know we have to be after 18 years we

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,830
never had that in medical ever either

59
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,839
and so you know you can probably expect

60
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,310
a good five to ten years before we get

61
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,439
anything that looks close to stability

62
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,120
so let's talk for a second about the

63
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,219
downsides or the challenges of working

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,110
at a startup you know you need to be the

65
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,379
kind of person who's going to be down

66
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,730
but I'm working on unexpected duties if

67
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,989
you're the kind of person who's like

68
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,119
well you know that's not my department

69
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,700
you know working at a start-up might not

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,769
be for you because you are going to

71
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,839
essentially be an employee in every

72
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,459
department you know you might be a

73
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,319
grower but some days you might need to

74
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,879
do packaging you might be a packager but

75
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,979
some days they might need you to file

76
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,289
stuff at HR you might be an HR person

77
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,699
and you might end up doing deliveries

78
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,858
now if you're the kind of person who's

79
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,259
going to be all I don't know what I do

80
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:18,030
well you know startups might not be for

81
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,469
you because you've got to be willing to

82
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:26,579
wear a lot of hats um also

83
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:29,219
if you live so close to the bone that if

84
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,290
you get paid a couple days late you may

85
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,169
want to have awarenesses around that too

86
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:36,509
because so many

87
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:39,929
5:02 folk are also running so close to

88
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:43,709
the bone that I see constantly folks are

89
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,840
you know one day three days a week late

90
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,390
simply because their cash flow is such a

91
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,299
drag now if you're gonna get a job at a

92
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:53,829
highly funded company and they even have

93
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:57,310
an HR person and you know the late of

94
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,890
that definitely goes down but more often

95
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,539
than not the 502 companies are doing

96
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,179
everything they can on a shoestring and

97
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:07,479
making their capital go as far as it can

98
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,219
and if they just made a big purchase so

99
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,340
that they can process it into product

100
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:14,439
they may not they may end up a roll the

101
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,410
dice and lost and they're like we don't

102
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,988
have payroll for like five days and you

103
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,090
know as an employee you need to be

104
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,919
willing to suck it up a little bit now I

105
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,869
don't mean let let your company take

106
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,300
advantage of you because you know we are

107
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,670
all our own company right and we need to

108
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,520
defend our own you know rights in the

109
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,770
world but at the same time there is such

110
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,240
thing as taking one for the team and and

111
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:39,339
you know having your pay will be a

112
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,470
little late is something that happens at

113
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,299
startups all the time so you need to

114
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,640
have like little emotional flexibility

115
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,370
on that and then of course there is the

116
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,229
hours right you know there's a lot of

117
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,180
variety of the kinds of jobs in Canada

118
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,640
there's there's hourly jobs and those

119
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,129
are pretty much you do your hours you

120
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,089
get paid for menu

121
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,889
but you know if you get a salary

122
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,089
position you need to understand that

123
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:04,269
there's a certain amount of that that is

124
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:06,939
open-ended you are paid salary for as

125
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:09,129
many hours as you're needed now granted

126
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,168
you may decide that the agreement that

127
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:13,269
you made with your employer is not

128
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:14,589
something that you're okay with anymore

129
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:17,319
and so you decide to leave because

130
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:19,899
they're asking 60 hours for 40 hours pay

131
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,228
which makes your hourly wage atrocious

132
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:24,939
right um but there's something to be

133
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:26,620
said for sweat equity right you know

134
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,810
when I started The Bachelor Island

135
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,430
Maryland entrepreneurs Alliance I wasn't

136
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,459
getting paid at all and actually I never

137
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,220
got paid for it but it was because I put

138
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:38,299
in the time to make it happen that I

139
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,070
learned connections and got the

140
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,110
networking done so that then I could

141
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,060
launch the rest of my consulting career

142
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,310
and podcast and all this other cool

143
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,990
stuff that's happening now similarly if

144
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,000
you're getting a job at a startup you

145
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,439
know

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,240
expecting to only work 40 hours is

147
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,920
probably a little unrealistic you know

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,509
50 is probably a little more realistic

149
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,420
and if you're the kind of person who's

150
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:01,519
like you know it's five I got plans I

151
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,230
have no pull some tubes I have to go you

152
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,029
know that's not really the kind of

153
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,129
startup mentality I'm getting is because

154
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:08,839
almost everybody in the industry does

155
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:11,149
but but the idea that you've got

156
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,859
somewhere better to be is the part that

157
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:14,539
I'm talking about and if you've got if

158
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,009
you go into it wit like I only want to

159
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,500
do my own job and I got somewhere else

160
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:22,610
to be it startups might not be the thing

161
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,040
for you so um also you need to be aware

162
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,980
that working and working in cannabis has

163
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:31,730
got some challenges for example being

164
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,290
judged by other people you know a lot of

165
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,790
people who are working in chemists they

166
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,310
have to deal with you know what their

167
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,660
aunt said or what their grandparents say

168
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,480
especially if you're hoping to get some

169
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,100
inheritance and I see this all the time

170
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,890
where people have got challenges they're

171
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,930
like oh man cannabis is my passion but

172
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,849
my family is like getting down on me or

173
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,230
maybe you need to get an apartment right

174
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,939
and you're applying for a new partner

175
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,319
and they look at your job and they're

176
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,819
like oh I don't know this company what

177
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,139
is this in your life Canada's industry

178
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,849
they're like no we don't want you to

179
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,019
find around here well they might want to

180
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,600
say that they just wouldn't call you

181
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:05,060
back right but that happens or how about

182
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,560
going to apply for a car and they find

183
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,300
out that your incomes from the cannabis

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,790
industry and they don't want to go fill

185
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,189
the cannabis money you know to pay off

186
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,290
your karma this stuff happens I mean

187
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:16,939
those of us who are cannabis business

188
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,890
owners we're still having a hard time

189
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:20,750
finding banks that will take our money

190
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,930
anyway so we can pay you your payroll

191
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,569
right so these kinds of challenges are

192
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,370
all doubled down as far as being a

193
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,860
start-up that's in cannabis and then

194
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,259
finally there is risk involved you know

195
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,310
cannabis companies go down all the time

196
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:39,589
and it is it's it's messy it is

197
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,870
high-risk the regulations are changing

198
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:44,509
there's moratoriums that suddenly make

199
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,819
your company illegal and the county that

200
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:50,269
you're in it is an exceptionally high

201
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,649
risk to job and and and sometimes they

202
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,779
don't even have to close sometimes all

203
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,250
they have to do is just reorganize they

204
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,949
can reorganize and decide you know what

205
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,779
when we fired for this we hired nine

206
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,550
people and you know we think we can do

207
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,409
it up for the three people and that

208
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,879
means that frees up six salaries to do

209
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,189
other things and now we're going to go

210
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,100
hire a bigger sales name you can be on

211
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:11,389
the low Internet and so these are the

212
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,879
challenges notices you need to be

213
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,919
prepared for now if you're if you heard

214
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,689
all that you're like yeah I can make all

215
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,160
that happen well then we get to talk

216
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:21,250
about the upsides right because we're

217
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,900
you mean cannabis is awesome and I am

218
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,910
very lucky to have you know lived in a

219
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:29,239
time where when I worked in the dot-com

220
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:31,280
boom they said you know oh we all have

221
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,409
these once-in-a-lifetime jobs and now I

222
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,429
get to twice in a lifetime we work right

223
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,559
because I've got two brand new

224
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,239
industries so if you can handle all that

225
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,099
risk we were just talking about well

226
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,529
number one you get paid to work legally

227
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,970
with weed which is awesome right it's

228
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,730
the kind of stuff that we used to like

229
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,889
joke about hi in college value someday

230
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,289
man and then like now we're living

231
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:53,899
someday and that's really cool and and

232
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:57,079
so also you know being involved in a

233
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:59,449
brand new industry it's it's too late

234
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,400
the ends exciting and you are

235
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,170
participating in building something that

236
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,078
has an system before and because of that

237
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:09,778
you get to put your mark on an industry

238
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:11,370
you can help make the rules and it's not

239
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:13,588
very often that you get to participate

240
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,620
in industry where you will be able to

241
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:18,510
play a role in making the rules and then

242
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,539
it up self is cool on the outside of

243
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:23,370
your compensation package also there is

244
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,769
a certain advantage if you're the kind

245
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,419
of person who likes to be on edge to be

246
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:30,028
able to work in something that's taboo

247
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,289
right I mean I I like it when I tell

248
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,000
people what I do for a living and you

249
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:34,528
can kind of see you know you know the

250
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,360
people who don't immediately like ask me

251
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:39,328
for a job are the other folks are going

252
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,459
kind of a little gas you know and and

253
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,958
that's cool because because I like to

254
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,268
you know I'd like to get that reaction a

255
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,319
little bit you know

256
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:48,409
being brought up with a bit less maybe

257
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,730
causes that so

258
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:52,698
but also there's other really important

259
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,220
things like thank asked upward mobility

260
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:58,169
there is no other industry right now

261
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,209
where you can move up in the ranks

262
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:02,578
faster than cannabis you know I've

263
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:04,828
already seen people who started a year

264
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:06,389
and a half ago is a budtender they did a

265
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:08,819
really good job suddenly now they were

266
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,039
like the supervising budtender and then

267
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,690
they moved into the operations manager

268
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,730
and they are opening closing the store

269
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,190
and then they got poked by another

270
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,050
company to to help run operations and

271
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,199
the processing facility and now they've

272
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:23,939
got you know a real salary and and

273
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:27,000
they're like okay well do I want to stay

274
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,040
here in Washington or do I want to go to

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,190
be hope go where I'm being posed to come

276
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:36,149
to in the matter right furthermore um it

277
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:39,510
happens fast the the talent pool is tiny

278
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:41,250
tiny right now and so once you get your

279
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:44,578
foot in the door if you're doing a good

280
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,610
job you can expect a quick leave up

281
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:49,469
early mobile position um also it means

282
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,839
that you can switch companies pretty

283
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,339
easily you know there is kind of a you

284
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,170
know a certain amount of glass ceiling

285
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,300
being a budtender because there's only

286
00:10:55,169 --> 00:11:00,509
so many so they're only so high to go in

287
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:02,399
retail right but but there's so much

288
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,740
reform asmath where people who are

289
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,120
already working in the industry that if

290
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,970
you have done a good job in a bunt

291
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,679
header you understand the 502 rules if

292
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,040
you've proven that you've got management

293
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:17,579
skills it's very easy for you to jump to

294
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:20,309
another company and and and be able to

295
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,680
move through you know a you know but

296
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:24,209
tender glass ceiling that way and so

297
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,679
there's there's a lot of this linear

298
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,519
mobility between companies and you know

299
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,620
managers are used to it you know it's

300
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,939
not like other industries where they're

301
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,259
all I've added you're leaving those

302
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,410
other company you're just gonna leave us

303
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:39,240
well yeah I'm probably gonna do that but

304
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:40,980
you might get two years out of me and

305
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,230
you need me and I need you so let's

306
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,490
dance you know it's a different scene

307
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,560
and so you know to a certain degree

308
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,720
working in cannabis is like musical

309
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,699
chairs where we're you know folks who

310
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,250
are attending this event they're coming

311
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,990
in and then their musical up and then up

312
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,639
again and then and then you know the

313
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,320
folks who come to an event like this in

314
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,409
a year they're gonna come in because

315
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,050
we're all new we're all new and that

316
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:08,939
allows for a lot more flexibility and

317
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:11,490
honestly negotiation in your

318
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,020
compensation package too and then

319
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,240
finally I touched on this a moment but

320
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,269
the skills you learn here in Washington

321
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,278
can be worth mad

322
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:22,720
in another state in a very short period

323
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:26,570
of time you know we are very lucky that

324
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,490
we are in Washington because we can get

325
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,040
our start here before all the other

326
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,709
states are have even gotten out of the

327
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,439
gate and so it is not uncommon now for

328
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:40,189
me to see people who started their gig

329
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,630
in Washington they they were huge into

330
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,490
learning about their job they studied

331
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:46,250
every aspect of it they stayed after

332
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,470
they ask questions they took positions

333
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,019
of management and and they learned jobs

334
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,170
that weren't theirs and so they got a

335
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:55,879
reputation for being good at it well now

336
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:59,809
they're being headhunted by a company in

337
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:02,480
Ohio or Florida or Arkansas or you know

338
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:05,088
wherever and and you know run by

339
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,620
recently got pending on it now suddenly

340
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,140
he's in Chicago right he's in Chicago

341
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,570
and he's building out five extraction

342
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:14,149
facilities and they treat him like a

343
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,700
rock star and you know he is a rock star

344
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,830
you know he's got mad skills but you

345
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,450
know when he started he was just an

346
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,180
extractor that people respected in

347
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,620
Washington right and now you know there

348
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:27,769
are there's national news stories about

349
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,110
his badass company in Chicago that can

350
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,059
be you we are still in the early days of

351
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,560
this industry where if you get started

352
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,828
now you can earn your stripes in

353
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:38,479
Washington and then go to another state

354
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:40,009
you know where your family lives or

355
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,389
where you like the weather better or you

356
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:42,289
just want to explore because maybe you

357
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:44,740
were going to do grew up in Washington

358
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:47,838
so anyway with that

359
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,039
know we're all very firmly established

360
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,770
the fact that we're all passionate about

361
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,139
being a cannabis and want to do this so

362
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,299
here's the formula that I have used my

363
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:58,189
entire life I actually learned this from

364
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:59,899
my folks growing up and I've used it in

365
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:03,710
all sorts of industries and it works

366
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:05,209
really really well in cannabis so so

367
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,139
here we go and this is the part of

368
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,300
you're taking notes you're gonna wanna

369
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:12,069
take notes on so what's the best tactic

370
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:15,349
to find the way to the job you want

371
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:19,090
choose the company that you want to work

372
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,470
for don't wait for them to post a job

373
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:24,290
you know it's important for you to

374
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,970
answer the ads when people are asking

375
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:28,149
because that's low-hanging fruit but

376
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,139
that ad that you're responding to

377
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:32,659
thousands of other people are very

378
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,699
likely responding to that ad as well

379
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:36,559
because the company's step and said

380
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,430
we're looking for folks I get this

381
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,809
deluge of resumes but now you're just in

382
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:44,029
with everybody else and you're not

383
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:46,369
really all that special and it makes it

384
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,230
harder to get the job makes it harder to

385
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,120
keep your job because they we got them

386
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,070
from an open call we can you know get

387
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,649
somebody just like them again doing the

388
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,290
same thing and when it comes time to let

389
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:59,539
people go unless you've really made

390
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:00,889
yourself look impressive to the company

391
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:02,839
you'll be one of the first people to get

392
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:05,720
rid of it because you were easy you know

393
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,850
and and we see that time and time again

394
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,370
that being able to stay at a company a

395
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,850
long time and you can start that with

396
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:16,039
day one and how you find them

397
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,470
so flip the script flip the script by

398
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,059
choosing the company that you want and

399
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,350
the job and you're interested and then

400
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:26,569
going after it very literally start by

401
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,750
making a list of ten companies in

402
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,520
cannabis that you want to work for that

403
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,289
you feel high about that you think

404
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,838
they're cool maybe their brand maybe

405
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:37,610
their product maybe the kind of

406
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,230
extraction technique they work on maybe

407
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,279
that they respect their employees maybe

408
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,800
they're into a diverse environment

409
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,338
whatever

410
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,649
that you feel is attracting you to that

411
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:49,480
company make a list of ten of those

412
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:52,089
companies and I don't need to make a

413
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,769
list of three companies or you make a

414
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,860
list of seven and then you kind of run

415
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:59,470
out of gas no go through and push and

416
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,389
find ten companies to target because the

417
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,278
secret is in the numbers right the more

418
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:05,078
people you contact the better you're

419
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,778
increasing the likelihood that you're

420
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:10,019
going to find a job now if what I said

421
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:10,019
you know

422
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:16,149
think about the companies that you want

423
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,190
to work with based on what they do right

424
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,230
if you're like I don't know what these

425
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,459
companies do or I don't know why I like

426
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,990
these companies well then you haven't

427
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:25,389
done your homework yet you need to do

428
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,730
more homework these companies want to

429
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,309
hire somebody who already has an

430
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,528
awareness of the industry now you don't

431
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:34,268
have to come from cannabis but you have

432
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:37,088
to at least understand the differences

433
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:38,649
between the companies you know find out

434
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,329
who the people are behind the company

435
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:43,389
where they do business read their

436
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:46,179
website so so you aren't developing your

437
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:48,338
tastes in a company that you want to

438
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,399
work for so that you can tell them why

439
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,870
you want to be there

440
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,240
so after you've got this list of 10

441
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,220
companies do your homework very

442
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,759
specifically about those 10 companies

443
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,860
think of each one of them as a target I

444
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,730
always recommend finding out who the

445
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,588
visionary is at the company find out who

446
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,299
that principal is because they're all

447
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:12,789
gonna have one they're gonna have the

448
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,769
person who had the idea and put it

449
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:17,379
together and decided that we're gonna

450
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:19,168
make this happen and it's those those

451
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,059
people

452
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:24,819
it's those people who will be most

453
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:27,129
responsive to the resume that you're

454
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:29,500
gonna send them that says I am

455
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,929
passionate or how you chose to do things

456
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,319
and if you're if you're passionate about

457
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,669
how you chose to do things um you're

458
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,980
already getting your foot in the door

459
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:41,860
because they're excited the visionary

460
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:45,630
could be like oh he loves or she loves

461
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:48,089
the decision that I made myself to to

462
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:51,660
run my company this way and so so that's

463
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:53,279
that's a warming a point for you so so

464
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,009
then you know after you've done this

465
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,509
research you've got your ten jobs our

466
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:00,359
ten companies that you want to work for

467
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,559
and you know who the visionary is now

468
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,000
you want to write your cover letter

469
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,079
because you know we're assuming that you

470
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,960
already have your professional

471
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,089
experiences page right now and if you

472
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,650
need help with writing a resume you know

473
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,089
the good folks at Veridian staffing are

474
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,560
the people to talk to that's not really

475
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:14,699
what we're talking about today but

476
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:18,299
you're going to write a cover letter

477
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:21,330
that is unique for each individual

478
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,789
company now they can have the same spine

479
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:25,619
they can be similar but you don't want

480
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,779
to take the same one and just go you

481
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,149
know ten times send it out you want to

482
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,609
write that resume the cover letter that

483
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,460
says why you think their company is

484
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:37,859
badass why you want to work for them and

485
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,130
what you think that you can add that

486
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:43,439
goes along with what you respect about

487
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,240
them if you're an extractor talk about

488
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,309
what you like about their extraction why

489
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,039
you hold it in esteem and what you think

490
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:52,349
you can add to their team if you are an

491
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,049
awesome administrator middle manager

492
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:57,809
tell them why you like how their company

493
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,309
is run or their brand or or even their

494
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,259
product line that you just think they've

495
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:04,980
got great pre-rolls whatever it is that

496
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:07,619
you love about that company write that

497
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,599
in a letter and you know sometimes when

498
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,329
we write cover letters we write them in

499
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,099
such a way so we sound my business e you

500
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:15,539
know you like clean up your language and

501
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:17,519
stuff you want to do that to a certain

502
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,009
degree but when you're writing a

503
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,289
passionate cover letter speak from your

504
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:25,470
heart you know you don't need to use

505
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:26,879
that business narrative language all the

506
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,860
time because if you think about it the

507
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,870
person who's reading it they are in

508
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,869
cannabis they started their company

509
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,909
because they're jazzed by again let them

510
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:38,429
hear some of your excitement don't be

511
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:41,100
shy about it don't don't get rid of the

512
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,710
Jazz enos in your writing voice just to

513
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,599
sound more professional because honestly

514
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,759
there aren't a lot of professional folks

515
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,339
in cannabis and that's really not a

516
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,750
standard that that a lot of people are

517
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,819
going by you know we want you to you

518
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,920
know you know shut up the work on time

519
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,210
we want you to know how to interact with

520
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,070
your other employees and we want to be

521
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,380
able to do your job really well but a

522
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:04,980
level of professionalism is not

523
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,290
something that is really you know a big

524
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,190
demand in the industry just yet and use

525
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,710
that to your advantage so

526
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,440
one thing that I learned today

527
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,750
from Kara from Veridian staffing during

528
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,450
her introduction for the for the folks

529
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,609
that are here today

530
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,830
she mentioned don't put in your cover

531
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:27,119
letters that you're a patient and you

532
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:29,819
know what that makes a lot of sense you

533
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,889
know back when Washington only had

534
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,599
medical cannabis it was important that

535
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,940
we've all heard our cover letters that

536
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,500
were a patient we get patients needs we

537
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,299
want to be involved in taking care of

538
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,900
your patients that was that was the [ __ ]

539
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:45,240
but now that now that medical has gone

540
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,190
away if you put in your cover letter

541
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,650
that you are a patient and so you

542
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,500
identify with the needs you're putting

543
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,090
the employer in an uncomfortable

544
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,460
position because you're coming up

545
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:59,399
against all sorts of laws that make them

546
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,059
not be able to tell you know because you

547
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,060
may be sick

548
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:13,389
jekko all right so um so you want to not

549
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,950
mention that you are sick and that

550
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,960
you're using cannabis or some way that's

551
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,730
that's your own business and it's better

552
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,680
for the employer to not know that

553
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,210
because you know they're concerned with

554
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,019
people what if we bring them in for an

555
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:28,180
interview and and they own the interview

556
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,650
and then we say no and then they come

557
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,750
back to us with a suit saying hats

558
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,150
because I got you know whatever you may

559
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,500
have they would just won't call you

560
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,610
because they don't want to even play

561
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:43,079
with that that risk of a lawsuit so so

562
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:45,209
don't mention your patient if you are

563
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,009
alright so um

564
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,480
after you have attached this fabulous

565
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:51,490
cover letter that you've written with

566
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,079
passion about the things that you like

567
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,549
about the company because you've

568
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,889
targeted this company and you've done

569
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:58,990
your homework now you send it to them

570
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,100
and this is the part that people kind of

571
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,430
roll their eyes about because we are

572
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:05,469
talking about redundancy here you want

573
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:09,279
to make sure that you try to get that

574
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:13,509
letter in the hands of the decision

575
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,220
makers any way you can so first and most

576
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:16,480
obvious you're going to put it in an

577
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,610
envelope and you're going to send it to

578
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,289
the principal the visionary the person

579
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:21,849
who started the company so that they

580
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,799
receive it with their mail and they open

581
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:26,769
it that is the most reliable way we have

582
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:27,940
to get it in their hands right you're

583
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:29,980
going to do that same thing but you're

584
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,809
going to send it attention HR and if you

585
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,610
can figure out who the HR person is if

586
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,049
they even have one you know more power

587
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:37,769
to you right you know you could even

588
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:39,779
call them up and say hand HR person okay

589
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:41,460
thanks juice you know and then and then

590
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:42,178
write it down and same thing now you do

591
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,990
it because you've done your

592
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,548
reconnaissance

593
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,048
so now you've sent them two letters

594
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:49,200
right you've send one to the principal

595
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:51,329
once one to the HR herself oh but they

596
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,788
may not like paper right and so now you

597
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:56,428
want that same thing via email so if you

598
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:59,839
can find the emails of the principal

599
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:02,400
that's right - it's amazing how many

600
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:05,519
principals have got their emails public

601
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,640
because they spoke at some events or or

602
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,700
they're on they're on an email list

603
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,799
that's that's online or who knows so

604
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,319
search them out search out their name

605
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:19,500
and the word email and see if you can

606
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,329
find it easily that way similarly if you

607
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,950
can when you're on your phones you know

608
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:24,869
kind of sneakily calling them you can

609
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,240
ask for the HR person's email address

610
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:28,408
and they they will likely not give it to

611
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,839
you they'll say oh please submit your

612
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:33,120
resume via our website thank you and but

613
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:34,769
you know maybe maybe you got somebody

614
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,869
covering for the receptionist whose it

615
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:38,970
was actually usually well enjoyed - my

616
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:41,609
god and her not her addresses boom

617
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,409
you're like thank you you know take

618
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:46,229
advantage with the chaos in the system

619
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:49,500
to your own advantage right and so and

620
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:52,079
so so now so now you said you've sent

621
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,058
this for different ways or two ways you

622
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,710
know you've sent it to be a mail you

623
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,109
send it via the internet to two

624
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,390
different people and now you're gonna

625
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:02,459
drop it off in person so most of these

626
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,350
you know they may not have facilities

627
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,150
that you can tour or get into but most

628
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:08,219
of them have got a front door that you

629
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,169
can open and startle the hell out of

630
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,140
everybody and they got walk-in traffic

631
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:15,409
and so it'll print it up on a decent

632
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,179
printer put it in the envelope and

633
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:19,919
and drop it off I always suggest putting

634
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,259
the visionaries name on it again I

635
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,970
probably wouldn't drop off - not one for

636
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:25,109
the visionary and one for HR just just

637
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,370
put the visionaries name on it because

638
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:28,769
chances are their reception it's going

639
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:31,319
to open it anyway but now now you know

640
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:34,408
that who you made sure you delivered it

641
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:36,579
themselves know some of the pushback I

642
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:38,350
get from folks about this is that you

643
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:39,699
know every dungeon see is going to annoy

644
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:42,129
them right because if you're successful

645
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,250
they've now gotten five communications

646
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,860
from you that you want a job from them

647
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:50,220
yeah in this many than this amount of

648
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:52,719
the time that might work against you but

649
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,000
number one chances are they're not going

650
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,470
to get all five communications from you

651
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,539
they're either going to not see the

652
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,039
emails or it's going to come the mail

653
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:02,349
and end up on somebody's desk and

654
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:03,609
forgotten or you know they're gonna get

655
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:05,139
the one that you handed them at the

656
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:06,579
front door and then take it with them to

657
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,620
lunch and then it's gonna get lost in

658
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:10,629
their car chances are they're not going

659
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:13,119
to get you're not going to successfully

660
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,590
ping them five times you know maybe

661
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,558
we'll see two of them maybe they'll see

662
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:19,990
three of them but you are only in the

663
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,460
game if they see your resume and then

664
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,319
sometimes you know they say you know uh

665
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,630
Moran doesn't really sit with you until

666
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,220
you've encountered it three times and

667
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,169
then maybe we'll make a purchase same

668
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,289
goes for getting a job the first time

669
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:34,030
the visionary sees your your resume they

670
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:35,558
may not even read it and the second time

671
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:36,910
they're like man is person is insistent

672
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:39,668
and then the third time they actually

673
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,919
read it is a damn good cover letter you

674
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:43,870
know I can feel their passion let's look

675
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,030
at their work experience yeah man this

676
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:48,548
works so this person likes my company

677
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:49,808
they like what I did with it and they

678
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:51,849
seem like your passion and they'd be

679
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:54,308
like a hammer on the office common for

680
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:56,619
our interviews right that's what we're

681
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:59,558
that is the goal of what trying to get

682
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:01,928
that interview and and the way you can

683
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,940
do that best is by doing everything you

684
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:05,919
can to get the resume in the

685
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,860
decision-makers hands and that's that's

686
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,679
what we're talking about here

687
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:15,548
then finally I suggest following calling

688
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:18,220
in a week and asking to talk to the

689
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:20,019
principal of engineering the HR person

690
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,360
and see if you can get something live on

691
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:23,740
the phone you know you're you're calling

692
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,269
the follow up to make sure they got your

693
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,589
resume and you know you know damn well

694
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:28,710
they did because you sent it five

695
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:30,959
different ways but this creates an

696
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,029
opportunity for them to save you oh yeah

697
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,009
we did get it that was pretty great I

698
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:37,379
was supposed to call you instead of an

699
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:39,990
interview I'm so glad you called me you

700
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,700
are making that person's job easier and

701
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,039
that's what we want to do we want to do

702
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,210
everything we can to make their job so

703
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,210
easy to hire us

704
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:54,210
so really your job is to get your resume

705
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,939
in the hands of the decision-maker and

706
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,380
you know that makes it it gives you kind

707
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,970
of a whole different thing than oh my

708
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,220
job is to get a job well yeah that is

709
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:05,880
but you need to break that out your job

710
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,710
is to target 10:00 do your homework send

711
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,720
it to them redundant ly and follow up

712
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,190
and make that opportunity where they ask

713
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,230
you to come in for the interview I'm

714
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,660
assuming that your passion and your

715
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,940
interest and your skill set is going to

716
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,790
shine when you're in an interview but

717
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,940
but you need to get to that point first

718
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:27,659
so so you know when you are done you

719
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,850
will have ten really great resumes with

720
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,529
awesome and passion cover letters in the

721
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,929
ends of ten different companies and I'll

722
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:36,539
tell you something you are going to be

723
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:40,259
ahead of everybody who's not in this

724
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:41,609
room right nobody's doing this no people

725
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,450
you know even in this room there's a lot

726
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,579
of folks we're going to hear the

727
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,710
strategy and then not do it because they

728
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:50,460
just they don't have the fire to do it

729
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:52,019
right but but if you do it you will be

730
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,730
in the you know top two or three percent

731
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:55,619
of people who are looking for a job in

732
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,960
canvas and that's that's really all you

733
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:59,879
need is you need to have something that

734
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,880
the other people are not doing and the

735
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,240
strategy is it so why does this work so

736
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,240
well

737
00:28:06,548 --> 00:28:12,710
so having a plan on how you are going to

738
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:15,589
get a job is more than just anybody else

739
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:18,308
has got to having this plan working the

740
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:21,980
plan working it through to the end

741
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:24,139
is is you implementing your own secret

742
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,579
to success and you know when when you're

743
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,620
sitting there in the interview and

744
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:29,389
you're talking to the HR person or to

745
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:30,949
the principal and they're all like

746
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,110
smiling because they got three copies of

747
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,509
your resume and they read your letter

748
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:37,399
and they're like man you really targeted

749
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:39,019
us you know you're here because we read

750
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,759
the thing and you're thinking yourself I

751
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:42,289
knew there were nine other companies

752
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,089
typically we're not going to talk about

753
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:46,190
that but what they're seeing they're

754
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,480
seeing your excitement that you you can

755
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,919
get things done that you've got the

756
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,990
follow-through you've got passion you've

757
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,669
got you know a plan you're gonna make an

758
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,200
awesome employee you know that

759
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:55,220
interviews will already have done they

760
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,640
just want to make sure that you're not

761
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,880
like a serial or at that and and so good

762
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,340
luck with that part

763
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,049
so so yeah I want to also say you yeah

764
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:07,459
go ahead and apply for the other jobs

765
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:09,558
that people are applying for it too

766
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,140
right because I'm not a big fan of you

767
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:14,960
know keeping all of one's eggs in a

768
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:17,809
single bicycle I know you know apply for

769
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,970
the jobs where they are listed in order

770
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:22,369
listed and on monster.com or craigslist

771
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,440
or whatever but that's not really where

772
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:26,779
you want to spend the most of your time

773
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,910
you want to do this kind of a plan where

774
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:30,619
you are being assertive and you're going

775
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,390
after the job you want right because

776
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:33,918
like the jobs that are listed on

777
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,990
Craigslist those are the jobs that are

778
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,250
available and you're like well I guess I

779
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,048
could take it to get my foot in the door

780
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,849
and you might need to take a job to get

781
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:43,069
your foot in the door anyway but how

782
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:44,659
much cooler is it to go to a company

783
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:47,649
that you already want to work for and

784
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:50,179
apply for a job that you want to do

785
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,259
instead of just taking you know the

786
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:53,630
low-hanging fruit of what's on

787
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:56,000
Craigslist and well you know I guess I

788
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:59,120
could do that like the aim higher and

789
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,400
then and then if you get a lower job you

790
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,899
know be grateful for that gig and then

791
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,880
and they get that experience and start

792
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,040
you know maybe another couple and then

793
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,910
do this

794
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:13,849
so there are so many jobs that are not

795
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:16,190
advertised people don't realize that the

796
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:20,299
majority of the jobs are not advertised

797
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:22,070
um so here are some examples so no one

798
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:24,529
has time to write or post the job

799
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:26,329
listing oh my god this is so common

800
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:28,759
they're all startups you know there's

801
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:31,609
probably not a dedicated HR person no

802
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:35,839
one likes hiring staff except maybe me

803
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:39,409
and and so when you are when you are

804
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:41,089
taking the initiative you have solved

805
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,790
the challenge they have of no one

806
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:46,309
wanting to write the damn map they also

807
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:48,680
have they have a job post at summer but

808
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:50,149
you have not seen it right so so maybe

809
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,820
you're looking at all the common places

810
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:55,340
but you know whoever is doing the thing

811
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:57,319
they're using their brother-in-law's you

812
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:59,029
know employment website that none of us

813
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:00,619
have heard of right now well we got the

814
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:03,889
job post we're not sure why we haven't

815
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:06,019
gotten any resumes in yet and and so so

816
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,759
suddenly they get yours in and they're

817
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,349
like oh yeah you know we cover one of

818
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,490
theirs let's interview them right and so

819
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:12,799
there's that possibility

820
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,839
um they aren't about to let someone go

821
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,669
this happens all the time you talk to

822
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,889
502 owners they all got that one

823
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:20,420
employee that they're like you know I

824
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,420
would love to get rid of them but I

825
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,039
don't have time to write the ad and and

826
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,930
they just don't have the there's not

827
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,369
ready to let them go but they wouldn't

828
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,810
really like to it's like give me a

829
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:31,399
reason to let them go you know and

830
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:33,049
sometimes it's because they like you'll

831
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,000
break something severe or something I

832
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:36,799
don't know I got my reason but maybe the

833
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,109
reason could just be that you showed up

834
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,919
and so you are causing the impetus to

835
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:44,719
create room for yourself

836
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,970
so maybe they have an employee they

837
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,829
don't like but they've not decided to

838
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:50,120
let them go yet and they haven't really

839
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:52,819
thought about letting the go but they

840
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:55,879
just don't like them and you think your

841
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:57,769
resume that says I like you I like your

842
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,780
company I'm badass of what you need to

843
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:02,180
hire me for let's do this and they're

844
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:03,898
like oh you know what I didn't like this

845
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,419
other employee but I didn't realize that

846
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:09,118
there was an alternative until you gave

847
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:11,340
them the alternative you're creating

848
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:14,238
these opportunities that didn't exist

849
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:16,769
before for them to hire you

850
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:18,389
also they need help but they've not

851
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,159
really thought about hiring somebody

852
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:21,868
well you know they've got their tight

853
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,519
team of five people this is how they've

854
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:25,738
done it for the last eight months and

855
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,909
they've been working their butts off but

856
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:28,259
it never really occurred to them well

857
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:31,369
you know you could make your life a lot

858
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,419
easier if you hired another person and

859
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:35,788
you know a lot of these companies don't

860
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:38,489
actually have you know a lot of budget

861
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:40,259
to hire another person but you know the

862
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:42,778
the amount of cannabis being sold is

863
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:45,298
going up and up every month these

864
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:47,338
companies that have not been in the

865
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:48,989
black are now starting to get in the

866
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:50,548
black and maybe it hadn't occurred to

867
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:53,009
them you know what maybe we should hire

868
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:55,440
somebody and maybe they don't have an ad

869
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:57,808
out but when they read your cover letter

870
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,259
they're like well I think it's time to

871
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,259
hire somebody

872
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:08,210
and then my favorite is the last one and

873
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,920
this is how I've gotten the majority of

874
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,920
my jobs in my life and definitely all

875
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,940
the kick-ass jobs I've got it's that you

876
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:20,058
win the visionary gets their hands on

877
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:23,750
your resume they read it and they're

878
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:26,240
like hell yes this person gets me they

879
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,940
get the company they get what we want to

880
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,440
do I'm gonna make a job for them and

881
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,360
it's you know I think it's probably

882
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,400
having eight or nine times in my life it

883
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:36,619
happens all the time and then after you

884
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,870
know I've always asked to speak to my

885
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:40,789
friends kids about this this strategy

886
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:42,849
and I hear back from that was like oh

887
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:45,170
you know so so

888
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:47,659
snowboarding company they weren't even

889
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:49,789
hiring but then when they got my resume

890
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,620
that said they don't have a snowboarder

891
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:53,960
and I love their company and I've been

892
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:55,879
to you know competitions and I've rooted

893
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,410
for their teams and like they asked me

894
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,450
for interview they made a job for me I

895
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,820
mean I'm delivering mail but I'm in at

896
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:05,289
Burton or wherever right you know this

897
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:08,659
could be you the idea of being able to

898
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:11,329
happen reach the visionary who can very

899
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:13,550
literally with a yeah yeah bring them in

900
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:16,009
for an interview create a job for you

901
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:19,369
there's a lot of power in reaching that

902
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:22,040
person and it happens all of the time so

903
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:25,460
two four six so there's there's six

904
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:29,690
different ways that a job could exist

905
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:31,730
for you that is not advertised and the

906
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,429
companies hire you doesn't even know

907
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,128
they need you yet this is why the

908
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,139
strategy works

909
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:41,358
so your odds are also way up because no

910
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,760
one else is applying for a job this way

911
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,949
and chances are they may not even be

912
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,369
getting very many resumes because a lot

913
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:51,189
of folks take the take the low road

914
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:52,358
on to the Craigslist jobs and you know

915
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,128
they send those they'll come to

916
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,808
something like this because I hope I can

917
00:34:54,128 --> 00:34:57,998
I can get up and go and be there for a

918
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:59,950
few hours on Sunday but not a lot of

919
00:34:57,998 --> 00:35:01,868
people are putting in the effort to

920
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:03,578
target companies and go to the kind of

921
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,200
work that we're talking about doing and

922
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:06,999
honestly you know the strategy of time

923
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,919
but this is not a lot of work right you

924
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:11,468
can do most of this in an afternoon you

925
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,809
just have to like stay focused and not

926
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:16,599
let yourself get distracted and you know

927
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:18,880
stay sober enough to do it and and you

928
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,609
know the time commitment is not a lot

929
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,009
what it is it's it's the hard commitment

930
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:25,630
that's a lot and that's why I'm talking

931
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:27,880
about getting a job in cannabis with

932
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:30,729
your passion today right this is not

933
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,739
this is not luck this is you activating

934
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:35,828
your passion to get something done

935
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:37,568
because you've got clear intent and that

936
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:39,818
clear intent will come through your

937
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:41,558
cover letter and it will just explode

938
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:43,619
all over the floor in your interview and

939
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:47,289
you'll have a job

940
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,358
so Canada's jobs are a game of odds you

941
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:51,880
know by by targeting the companies that

942
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:54,248
you want versus taking the ones that are

943
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,559
applying you are increasing your odds of

944
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:58,389
getting a job by writing your great

945
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,278
cover letter you're increasing your odds

946
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:02,018
and then by being redundant and getting

947
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:04,329
to them you're increasing your odds and

948
00:36:02,018 --> 00:36:05,889
and they're if you were serious about

949
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,778
doing this increasing your odds and

950
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:09,788
decreasing your risk is what how you

951
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:11,199
want to play this game and and you're

952
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:13,920
going to be the only person in the room

953
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,538
doing that for them

954
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,369
so I mean I've seen this work time and

955
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:20,259
time again both for myself and for

956
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:22,180
people that I work with and for folks

957
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:23,829
that I consult for and it's really

958
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:26,978
amazing because that now I know so many

959
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:29,410
people who who own cannabis businesses

960
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:30,838
and and so many the visionaries they

961
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:34,088
feel like people

962
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:35,558
don't hear them they think they don't

963
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:36,728
understand their vision anymore and

964
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,339
they're all stuck with the day-to-day

965
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:41,139
operations BS stuff and they're not

966
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:43,778
getting the necessarily do all of the

967
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:45,278
the passionate stuff that they kind of

968
00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:47,820
envision at the beginning because in the

969
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:49,739
end you know the fantasy working in

970
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,570
cannabis or the fantasy of starting a

971
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:54,179
job in cannabis is very much unlike

972
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:55,170
going to work every day especially if

973
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,429
it's everyday you know if you've heard

974
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,309
of the visionary you're working seven

975
00:36:56,429 --> 00:37:01,859
days a week and to have your resume come

976
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:03,659
in where you are speaking the secret

977
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,300
language of why what they're doing is

978
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:07,639
cool people respond to that in a very

979
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,670
serious way

980
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:14,489
so that's the strategy I suggest that

981
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,889
you do each step do it today do not put

982
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:18,569
this off and

983
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:22,500
follow through because just sending them

984
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:24,800
the resume may not be enough without you

985
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,570
following up a call

986
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,980
so I've got a little bit extra time so

987
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:32,059
I'll take like three questions if

988
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,059
anybody's got some questions

989
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:51,420
right now that's a really good point so

990
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,400
Dave says what if there are not and

991
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,440
Animas companies within your area to

992
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,608
commute and you know when I talk about

993
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,220
this in other industries what I

994
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:02,069
recommend people do is you take a you

995
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:04,199
take a map and you kind of draw an

996
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,420
outline of where you're willing to

997
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,129
commute and then you find companies

998
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,289
within that area that you think are cool

999
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,329
now now that works a lot easier when

1000
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:13,829
it's not just one industry if you've got

1001
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:15,358
more flexibility in your industry but

1002
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:17,190
since we're talking about only cannabis

1003
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,949
what Dave's talking about is is correct

1004
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:22,440
especially if you live in a county with

1005
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:24,509
a moratorium right so in that case so

1006
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,519
today saying that there's there's only

1007
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,100
for cannabis companies that are close

1008
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:31,409
enough to commute to and I would say

1009
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,569
just write them even better for those

1010
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:36,420
for you know it's hard to what you can

1011
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,550
you know if they don't exist yet you

1012
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,700
can't write to them but you know as part

1013
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:45,960
of doing the R&amp;D to get the job you know

1014
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:48,989
watch for new companies to you know you

1015
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,699
can you can see the the landscape usage

1016
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:52,500
boards that go up before they set up

1017
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:54,599
shop you know and you know write to them

1018
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,980
before they even exist as a company well

1019
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,599
you're right you know the fact that the

1020
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,789
canvas companies are not evenly

1021
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,039
distributed around the state means that

1022
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:04,590
anybody in you know King County

1023
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,509
generally is in a way better position

1024
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,530
that somebody who's like way north you

1025
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,530
know we're the Canadian border

1026
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:18,680
who the visionaries are by going to your

1027
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:21,109
local box floor and where do you buy

1028
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,759
yeah there's a there's a lot of creative

1029
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,559
ways to find out who the visionary is

1030
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,810
you know you can you can find out who

1031
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,190
they are by you know looking at

1032
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:31,070
interviews that they may have done in

1033
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,889
don't magazine or Northwest leave Google

1034
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:35,920
their name look at their you know search

1035
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:37,969
the company name and a LinkedIn right

1036
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,590
you could even call that same

1037
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:41,929
receptionist that gave you the HR

1038
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,850
person's email address maybe the year

1039
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:45,379
you can say oh you know I'm calling what

1040
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,549
what's the name of the person who

1041
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,500
founded the company and they'll probably

1042
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,789
give it to you pretty easily so just

1043
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,650
just be you know a little little

1044
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:54,050
creative about it it's not really hard a

1045
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,570
lot of most of these visionaries you

1046
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:59,180
know I've got a nice dose of ego but you

1047
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:01,280
need to run a company and because of

1048
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:02,779
that they're usually somewhere you know

1049
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,950
out and about talking about how badass

1050
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,950
their company is anyway

1051
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:17,029
my best advice for somebody who wants to

1052
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,470
start their own cannabis company is to

1053
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,840
do something that does not require a

1054
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:22,699
license

1055
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,329
the hardest companies to run are the

1056
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:29,710
ones that are licensed by the state

1057
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:29,710
it's like what is they

1058
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,700
correct because you don't you know you

1059
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:36,440
need to get certified by the state but

1060
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:38,750
you don't necessarily have to be to get

1061
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,420
a license the hoops that you have to go

1062
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,639
through to obtain your processor license

1063
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,340
or your growers license or god help you

1064
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:47,779
a retail store and and just to have you

1065
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,870
know where you live I have a moratorium

1066
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:54,019
the regulations are so ugly in

1067
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:56,659
Washington and the opportunities are so

1068
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:59,090
rich in quarterly industries you know

1069
00:40:56,659 --> 00:41:01,670
maybe you're going to invent like the

1070
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,660
new super cool bomb or you're you're

1071
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,210
going you know you want to do a

1072
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:07,519
lifestyle brand and put out clothes or

1073
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,570
you've got you know like the heavy

1074
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,579
weights like who knew there was an Indus

1075
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,380
and wicks right but there's a couple

1076
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:15,259
really great companies that are making

1077
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,309
money net I mean

1078
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,860
invent something really cool that

1079
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:22,529
dabbers are gonna love right you know

1080
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:25,079
dampers have got so much discretionary

1081
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,240
income to be able to buy the things of

1082
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,569
their passion they will buy your Google

1083
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:32,819
invention and so so similarly with

1084
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,400
services right maybe maybe you are an

1085
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,350
accountant at REI or like a bookkeeper

1086
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,090
at REI and like you love your you know

1087
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:40,409
you love a REI and stuff but you want to

1088
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:44,250
do something a little more edgy well

1089
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:46,289
maybe you start a service firm that

1090
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:49,139
specializes in catering to the cannabis

1091
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:50,639
industry and now suddenly you know

1092
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,650
you're the you're the first person that

1093
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,150
does your specialty for only cannabis

1094
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,410
clients right and maybe you're doing

1095
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,820
that while we were still working in

1096
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:59,250
Ariane you're doing this you know one

1097
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,740
day a week person so so that that would

1098
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,539
be my best recommendation is to find

1099
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:07,049
something that you're excited about that

1100
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:08,789
you are willing to sell and to try to

1101
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:11,010
stay out of anything that requires the

1102
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:13,730
license at this point one more question

1103
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:13,730
yes

1104
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:24,039
at this time

1105
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:25,420
report what's appropriate at that stage

1106
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:27,250
right on let's let's answer that

1107
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,200
question a couple ways so she's asking

1108
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:32,018
about what happens if you have your

1109
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,298
interview and then they say no thanks so

1110
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:36,879
the first thing would be if you really

1111
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:40,000
want that company apply again in six

1112
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,710
months and you know you know three

1113
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,318
months is a little bit on the fast side

1114
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:45,670
um they might decide that you're in your

1115
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,650
attend and you don't really want that

1116
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,389
but definitely six months I mean all

1117
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,730
these companies they radically change

1118
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:53,259
every couple months so it's six months

1119
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,759
you know the person in HR who

1120
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:58,059
interviewed you may not even be there

1121
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:59,318
anymore right and so and their needs and

1122
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:01,089
maybe they just got another round of

1123
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:03,400
financing so now they can hire a lot

1124
00:43:01,088 --> 00:43:04,750
more people so so that's number one go

1125
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,059
back to the same company that you're all

1126
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:10,298
juiced about in six months but more to

1127
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:12,930
your question wait what is the specific

1128
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:12,929
part of your question

1129
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,809
so do that Oh IRA and then the second

1130
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,480
part is go look for a job at a different

1131
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:23,559
company don't sweat right because except

1132
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,210
for maybe where Dave lives where there's

1133
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,160
only four companies there's lots of

1134
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,380
cannabis companies where we're generally

1135
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:32,288
like you were in the Seattle land area

1136
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:34,630
right and so so just you know don't

1137
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:35,950
don't get too bummed out and I mean I

1138
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:38,980
certainly have got like two or three

1139
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:41,500
brands in the state that I think are

1140
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,000
super cool and then I was looking for a

1141
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,548
job I would go there and if they told me

1142
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,579
no I'd be like crestfallen but the game

1143
00:43:45,548 --> 00:43:50,858
is not to only be able to get a job with

1144
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:54,009
solstice right the game is to get a job

1145
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:56,199
in Canada's period so if you interview

1146
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:57,429
with the super cool cool and they're not

1147
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:59,199
ready for you it doesn't mean that

1148
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:00,460
you're a bad person or you're not ever

1149
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,868
going to be able to work with them it

1150
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,909
means it's not the right fit right now

1151
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:05,798
so go back to them in six months and in

1152
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:09,730
the meantime the shift of somebody else

1153
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:12,880
on your list so if you are into this

1154
