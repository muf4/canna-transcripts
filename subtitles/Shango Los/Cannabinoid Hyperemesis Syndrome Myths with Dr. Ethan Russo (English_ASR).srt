1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,839
hi there friends Shango Los from shaping

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,480
fire and I am here again with Dr Ethan

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,839
Russo good friend of ours and we are

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,640
going to be talking about cannabis

5
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:24,198
hyperemesis syndrome today and if you

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,359
are new to CHS I encourage you to listen

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,960
to shaping Fire episode 80 where Dr

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,920
Russo and I talk about cannabis

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,719
hyperemesis syndrome in detail but today

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,760
we are talking about CHS specifically to

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,960
talk about Dr Russo's new paper on the

12
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:44,199
topic debunking some of the the the

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,759
myths that are being circulated about

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,120
CHS so the recent article we're

15
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,920
discussing today is called uh

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:55,238
cannabinoid hyperemisis syndrome genetic

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,600
sucess susceptibility to toxic exposure

18
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:00,439
so Ethan thank you for being here today

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,359
um this new paper

20
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,840
uh is very necessary to clear the air

21
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:10,759
about what many people think the causes

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,478
are to CHS and very freely share their

23
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,799
opinions online about what causes CHS

24
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,359
but are not keeping up with the science

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,118
and um your review paper's goal as far

26
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,599
as I understand it is to help clear up

27
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,879
those understandings so as we move

28
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,319
forward um both those of us who are

29
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:33,599
cannabis enthusiasts and are susceptible

30
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:36,639
to to having CHS but also all of us who

31
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,319
speak online and to conferences so that

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,640
we understand the state of the science

33
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:44,718
and we can be spreading appropriate

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,239
information so so let's start at the top

35
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:51,000
um I think that for many people who are

36
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:55,640
are seeing this they may be new to uh

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,438
CHS as uh as an ailment so um uh while

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,118
people can find out all about it in

39
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:03,559
detail on shaping fire uh episode 80

40
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,599
would you please just summarize for us

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,159
what CHS is to bring everybody up to

42
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:13,318
speed sure thanks Shango so canabo

43
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:16,919
hyperemesis syndrome or CHS was first

44
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,799
described 20 years ago in 204 in

45
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,439
Australia in eight patients who

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,680
presented unbeknownst to each other with

47
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:28,840
a similar set of signs and symptoms

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,760
which consisted of nausea vomiting

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,360
abdominal pain

50
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:36,598
and an

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,800
unusual uh manifestation that they would

52
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:43,560
spend hours at times taking hot showers

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,680
or baths to reduce symptoms and all of

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,400
these were chronic users of high THC

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,239
cannabis so that was 20 years ago but

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,400
the description really hasn't changed

57
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:00,959
this Syndrome has become more prevalent

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,560
it seems some by virtue of recogn

59
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,158
of the syndrome but also associated with

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,799
the higher potency cannabis and

61
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,439
particularly concentrates that have

62
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,680
become more generally available it

63
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,400
Remains the case that this is far more

64
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,280
prevalent in the US and Canada where

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,360
there is access to such materials as

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,719
compared to the rest of the

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:29,080
world so we are seeing an increase

68
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:32,120
amount of CHS prevalence in people um

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,719
because the um the potency of the

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,759
products that we have are increasing and

71
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,719
we're talking about to some degree

72
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,399
higher THC um uh flour but really what

73
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,438
we're talking about is oil concentrates

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,239
and dabbing right quite often um in our

75
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:51,079
surve published a couple of years ago

76
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,519
the average intake was four grams a day

77
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:59,760
of high THC material among CHS sufferers

78
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:03,000
I know so um when we spoke um during

79
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,078
aping Fire episode 80 um you were very

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,079
clear that uh in the early days we did

81
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,519
not know what the cause was um which

82
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:15,560
caused science to happen right and so uh

83
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:19,079
you came on the show to talk about um

84
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,000
what was not the cause and what you had

85
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,000
found was the cause or the pathway to

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,879
the cause which gave us a better idea of

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,639
what we were dealing with now I'm going

88
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,199
to ask you in a moment to go through the

89
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,400
list with me of the various things that

90
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,199
you debunk in your new paper that are

91
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,879
not the cause but you were very uh clear

92
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,639
on episode 80 that we do know what the

93
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,918
genetic mutations are in a human that

94
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,960
makes them susceptible to

95
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,359
CHS um let's cement that in right now

96
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:54,319
will you describe the genetic mutations

97
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,400
that are at the root of CHS sure so it

98
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,399
was apparent to me over time that there

99
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,399
was a small minority of cannabis users

100
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:06,279
that seem susceptible to

101
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,679
CHS and these were distinct from a lot

102
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,638
of people we know that used high amounts

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,879
of cannabis but had never had similar

104
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:19,079
symptoms so what was the difference um

105
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:21,199
although as we'll discuss people had

106
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,038
implicated things like

107
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,960
pesticides uh the symptoms didn't match

108
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:30,159
and I felt that the cause of the

109
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:33,159
susceptibility to ch

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,560
must be genetic explaining why some

111
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:40,520
people got it and some people did not um

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,639
so we really started

113
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:47,560
there and so um I know for most folks um

114
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,360
hearing you talk about the AL will not

115
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,759
be anything that anyone understands but

116
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,520
but but there are certainly people who

117
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,759
are listening and watching who are um

118
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,719
you know legit scientists so for that

119
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,479
those folks in the audience would you go

120
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,280
through and hit where the mutations are

121
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:08,159
sure so our first candidate was the gene

122
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:11,799
that encodes the CB1 receptor canabo one

123
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,240
receptor where THC works and our endoc

124
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,160
canabo the canabo within our body work

125
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,079
but we didn't see a mutation there and

126
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,800
this will be important later I think

127
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,079
when we discuss distinctions from other

128
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,840
syndromes that are mistaken for

129
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,399
CHS our other two hypotheses were that

130
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:34,119
this had something to do with the

131
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:38,159
enzymes that break down uh THC in the

132
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,199
body um specifically something called

133
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,240
cyp2c9 and we did see statistically

134
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,720
significant difference that this gene or

135
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,680
mutation on a gene which called a snip

136
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,360
or um single nucleotide polymorphism was

137
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,759
present statistically significantly more

138
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,240
in people with CHS as opposed to our

139
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,598
control group which was people used High

140
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,038
volumes of cannabis again averaging four

141
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:09,038
grams a day but did not have CHS so we

142
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:12,159
did see a mutation there uh the third

143
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,759
hypothesis which also proved true was a

144
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,639
mutation on what's called trip

145
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:21,840
V1 trip V1 is a receptor that has to do

146
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,079
with pain and it's triggered by heat and

147
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:29,758
ethanol otherwise known as alcohol um

148
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:33,279
and acid um and uh this mutation helped

149
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,759
explain why the Heat or capsacin the

150
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:39,318
chili pepper extract on the skin

151
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,960
temporarily reduces symtoms uh so those

152
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:46,800
were two um we found two mutations on

153
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,878
genes affecting dopamine dopamine is a

154
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,478
very important neurotransmitter in the

155
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,599
brain and problems with it are

156
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,199
associated with addiction as well as

157
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,598
psychosis

158
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,080
schizophrenia um and a whole host of

159
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:04,319
other Psych atric problems having two

160
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,478
genes that were statistically

161
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,879
significantly present in the CHS group

162
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:13,240
as compared to the high volume cannabis

163
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,479
users that didn't have CHS again

164
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,840
indicated something important at the

165
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,399
root of it and we know that a drug that

166
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:24,239
blocks do dopamine haloperidol is one of

167
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:27,758
the things that is used in emergency

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,319
rooms to try to stop the on nause and

169
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,320
vomiting whereas more common drugs to

170
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,959
treat nause and vomiting don't work in

171
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,320
this syndrome um finally there was a

172
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,319
mutation on a gene called abca1 that has

173
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,040
to do with cholesterol

174
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,160
metabolism this is really unexpected but

175
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:52,679
um has some important implications in

176
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:56,679
that uh mutations there may make these

177
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:59,559
people susceptible to Alzheimer disease

178
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:02,000
uh coronary artery disease and diabetes

179
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:06,879
mtis later in

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,679
life so the reason why we're here is to

181
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:13,399
remove some of the untrue information

182
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:17,639
that's being spread around and the

183
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:20,600
impetus for um Dr Russo uh publishing

184
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,838
this article is very specific um would

185
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,720
you please explain to us um what

186
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,880
happened um to cause you to uh go

187
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,680
through the effort to put out the paper

188
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:32,320
well I'm afraid we're dealing with a

189
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:36,120
post-truth world uh where science is

190
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,600
being ignored or challenged um but I

191
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,839
kept hearing that well it must be this

192
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,519
or it must be that and people are really

193
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:50,600
devoted to trying disprove the fact that

194
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,679
uh the CHS occurs due to cannabis usage

195
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,600
or synthetic

196
00:09:52,679 --> 00:10:00,399
cannaboids that hit the same CB1

197
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,120
receptor um so among these

198
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,919
misconceptions uh have been pesticide

199
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,600
exposure now I am the first one to say

200
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,958
that pesticides in cannabis is a huge

201
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,920
problem where there isn't sufficient

202
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:17,759
screening testing going on I published

203
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,799
on this in 2016 to show the rampant

204
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:24,200
contamination that was present in the

205
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:27,039
Washington State Legal Market uh but the

206
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,680
fact is as bad as those chemicals are

207
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:33,159
and as many problems as they can create

208
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:35,759
over time the symptoms that they produce

209
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:40,120
don't match CHS at

210
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:42,480
all so um people are very often online

211
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,440
saying it's got to be pesticides or this

212
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,560
you know this kind of pedde or or Eagle

213
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,959
20 or and then everybody's got an

214
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,479
anecdotal story of how it happened to

215
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,559
their their Uncle cousin trimmer

216
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,519
whatever right but but these individual

217
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:00,399
stories do not add up to science because

218
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,560
you have looked at um a larger pool of

219
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,159
both data and people sure additionally

220
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:09,359
we've had people who've documented that

221
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:13,559
uh the Cannabis they used was from a hom

222
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:17,039
grow with no pesticide use at all um so

223
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:19,799
it it just doesn't fit um and

224
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,639
unfortunately we're dealing with some a

225
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,838
lot of Wishful Thinking here in relation

226
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,720
to this

227
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:34,680
diagnosis so um another category that is

228
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:36,920
common um to blame for CHS is is neem um

229
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,000
uh uh there's a lot of talk about oh you

230
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,399
know people use neem and and this is

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,559
what happens when you smoke cannabis

232
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,958
that has been um treated with neem or

233
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:50,638
worse so when you concentrate it into an

234
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,838
oil and then Dab Oil with neem in in it

235
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,799
um what does the science say well it

236
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,399
really doesn't fit and I take this one

237
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,359
personally because I've used neem uh in

238
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,720
my organic gardening for many years and

239
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,720
I admit I've eaten berries uh the same

240
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,920
day I've sprayed with it no

241
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,720
repercussions but that's only an

242
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:14,319
anecdote the truth is um that neem is a

243
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,639
considered a safe organic pesticide for

244
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,639
the most part

245
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,480
um I scoured the literature on

246
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,919
toxicities associated with neem oil and

247
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,278
it's one of its active ingredients

248
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:33,639
called aaon and again we've got a

249
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:36,360
situation where the symptoms don't fit

250
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:40,480
there have been rare cases of toxicity

251
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,159
one associated with an a suicide attempt

252
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,199
um but we've got a mismatch additionally

253
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,039
is that

254
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:50,078
araon has an extremely high boiling

255
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,399
point it's questionable that you would

256
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:57,479
even recruit it out of cannabis by

257
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:00,679
smoking even though uh the the lit tip

258
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,680
of a cannabis joint is uh in the

259
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:08,559
hundreds of degrees celsus uh so it uh

260
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:12,399
it really is a situation that once again

261
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,638
can't explain the syndrome and again

262
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,839
wishful thinking too right because we

263
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,360
wish we could just point to ah it is

264
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,519
this chemical and let's just remove that

265
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,278
but it's far more complex because the

266
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,879
precursors are actually our genetic

267
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:30,519
makeup sure additionally um neem is

268
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,838
typically used pre flowering as the

269
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:38,078
cannabis plant uh is growing it

270
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:41,320
dissipates entirely in 3 to 4 days um

271
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:45,198
and I I just think if you did analyses

272
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,920
for a zaratin or neem on flower you'd

273
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:51,399
rarely find it and the concentrations

274
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:54,159
couldn't possibly explain the few cases

275
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,839
of toxicity that have been observed

276
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:01,879
mostly in people who drank a some

277
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:05,680
significant amount of uh a or as thata

278
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:09,198
and fluid and even if somebody um was

279
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:12,278
Ill advised and they use neem in the you

280
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,319
know seventh week of flower or something

281
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:17,039
um you know while that is not going to

282
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,720
be a necessarily good experience for the

283
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:24,198
Cannabis Enthusiast the um the diagnoses

284
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,079
for CHS are so spread out with so many

285
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:29,319
different sources that we know that a a

286
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:32,519
very rare opportunity like that is going

287
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:37,720
to be the cause no again uh statistics

288
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:41,198
would not explain this I know um another

289
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,959
uh potential or or rumored cause for CHS

290
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,838
that that you debunk in the paper is uh

291
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,838
hop Laten viroid and so would you go

292
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,320
through that analysis too sure so a

293
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,839
virid is sort of a primitive virus and

294
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,199
this has been rampant um in the

295
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,839
cultivation of cannabis it does stunt

296
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:05,838
the growth of the plant and can uh limit

297
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:08,720
its potency but here's the thing it not

298
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,560
only has there never been a case of hop

299
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,360
latent vroid showed in a human there are

300
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:18,119
no cases of any plant virus or vroid

301
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,278
affecting humans we are sufficiently

302
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,198
different from Plants uh fellow living

303
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,439
creatures but we're sufficiently

304
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:30,000
different that there's no likelihood uh

305
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:34,079
that any infectious agent of this pipe

306
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,559
uh could uh affect a human let alone

307
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,879
with

308
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:42,399
CHS so so now we get to the big one so

309
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:47,879
um we'll come at this a couple different

310
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:50,958
ways the first is that um as the

311
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:55,078
definition of cannabis hyperemesis

312
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:59,879
syndrome evolved um some were wondering

313
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:04,519
if it was cyclic vomiting syndrome then

314
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:07,399
uh recently we have run into that um a

315
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,839
uh significant scientific journal group

316
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,799
them together which got your dander up

317
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,800
and you wanted to clarify sure so uh I'd

318
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,879
like you to do both at the same time

319
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,519
right would you would you address uh

320
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:23,078
what cyclic vomiting

321
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,919
is how it is

322
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,838
not um

323
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:30,240
CHS and the error that's made in the

324
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,920
scientific journal sure so this is in

325
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,919
the Journal of

326
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:38,958
gastroenterology and they said basically

327
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:42,958
that CHS was a subset of cyclic vomiting

328
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:45,599
syndrome I took UMD at this because uh

329
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,518
CVS cyclic vomiting syndrome is

330
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,839
something that I'm very familiar with as

331
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,720
a neurologist particularly as a

332
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,199
pediatric neurologist so

333
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:01,240
CVS cyclic vomiting syndrome typically

334
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:05,199
presents in a child or or a teenager who

335
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,160
has episod episodic nauseum vomiting

336
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,880
without other explanation and they might

337
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:16,439
get an an advanced workup uh invasive

338
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:19,319
studies scans you name it um but what

339
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:22,880
this is what's known as a form fruit

340
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:25,879
frustrated form of migraine the natural

341
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,559
history of cyclic vomiting syndrome is

342
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,679
this is a child or teenager who has a

343
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:36,639
family history of migraine typically

344
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:40,000
their mother and they get the symptoms

345
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,280
of nause and vomiting without a headache

346
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,240
but as they get older the migraine with

347
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:50,160
the headache will establish itself

348
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:54,279
interestingly cyclic vomiting syndrome

349
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,720
like many forms of migraine is very

350
00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:00,918
amenable to treatment with cannabis

351
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,798
whether it be acute or is a preventive

352
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:07,240
but you can see how this has created

353
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:11,038
confusion however I'm quite critical in

354
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,679
that uh people with nause and vomiting

355
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,158
typically end up in emergency

356
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,720
departments and unless the doctor is

357
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,760
willing to spend the time to really ask

358
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,120
the right questions it's simple to have

359
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:27,679
this confusion finally can we really

360
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:32,038
tell the difference well um in fact

361
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:35,880
there is that mut on the CB1 Gene

362
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:38,480
cnr1 um there is a mutation in the

363
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,080
cyclic rening syndrome that we did not

364
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,400
find in the cannabinoid hyperemesis

365
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:48,000
syndrome patients so we have a the

366
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,960
capability of distinguishing these based

367
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,919
on Laboratory

368
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,360
Testing so um I want to finish up

369
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:59,080
talking about um um the various canabo

370
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,599
and their role in CHS but I want to I

371
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:03,759
want to hit this this I want to

372
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:06,959
summarize what you just said very

373
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,519
clearly that while we are still

374
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,960
researching

375
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:15,720
CHS we have got enough science done at

376
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,319
this point that we understand that CHS

377
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,240
is not called by caused by pesticides

378
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:26,158
it's not caused by neem and it's not uh

379
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,599
CVS and what we know is that uh to

380
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:32,400
develop

381
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,319
CHS uh um you must have the pre-existing

382
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,360
gene

383
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:40,038
mutations and then you need to embibe a

384
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:43,399
whole lot of cannabis generally speaking

385
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:46,480
generally speaking upwards of uh you

386
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,240
know four grams of concentrate a day

387
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,679
generally speaking with each person

388
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,599
being you know having some variation do

389
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,159
I have the summary right yeah pretty

390
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:57,879
much um you know everybody might have a

391
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,200
different threshold for this I should

392
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,280
also point out that anybody who suddenly

393
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,480
has exposure to too high a dose of THC

394
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,798
may get sick and vomit but that's very

395
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,880
different from having this chronic

396
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:14,079
cyclic uh

397
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:16,799
situation um so we really are able to

398
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:20,519
distinguish it does require actually

399
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,720
talking to patients in detail which is

400
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,599
really not the model of current medicine

401
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,960
in this country I'm afraid right okay so

402
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:31,119
um I want to talk about how you finish

403
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,279
the paper which I found very interesting

404
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:37,158
because you know as somebody who is um

405
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:41,918
in cannabis media I get reached out to

406
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:43,440
by people who are experiencing CHS and

407
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,360
um they're you know by definition

408
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,840
they're a cannabis Enthusiast right they

409
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,439
they're they're using a lot of cannabis

410
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,839
every day which is how that in

411
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,000
cooperation with their gene mutations

412
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,720
causes these symptoms and so uh people

413
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,038
say oh I'm I'm going to try to switch to

414
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,640
just doing CB BD or I'm going to switch

415
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:07,200
to just CBG or um for this particular

416
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,640
autoimmune I'm going to try just

417
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,919
thca and um your your paper goes through

418
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,120
each of the popular cannabinoids that

419
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,080
that patients have tried to shift

420
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:22,079
through kind of

421
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:24,720
denying the Doom scenario of of actually

422
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,038
not being able to use cannabis anymore

423
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,120
and and now we have research that talks

424
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,158
about why to shift to another

425
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:36,079
cannabinoid is is not really going to

426
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,919
help um would you delineate that sure so

427
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:43,439
again we've implicated herbal cannabis

428
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:46,720
and THC in uh triggering CHS symptoms

429
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,480
but it will occur with any drug or

430
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,278
cannabinoid that stimulates the CB1

431
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,880
receptor so this would include synthetic

432
00:21:52,278 --> 00:22:00,400
Delta 8 it would include canaban

433
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,919
CBN it might involve CBD the problem

434
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:08,000
there is twofold number one it's

435
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:09,840
extremely hard to uh have a CBD

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,278
preparation that isn't going to have

437
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:18,240
some amount of

438
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:21,679
THC uh that's one um and two is that uh

439
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,319
CBD over time may increase in nide

440
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,038
levels and this possibly also is a

441
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:30,798
trigger to CHS symptoms if the levels

442
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:34,000
are too high um so there're those you

443
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:37,400
mentioned CBG as you know uh we've done

444
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,519
a lot of work on published on uh canaba

445
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,159
gereral I think it's a wonderful agent

446
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:45,000
um it is not

447
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,600
intoxicating uh it does not stimulate

448
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,519
the CB1 receptor with any particular

449
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:54,278
potency um on its own it's not an

450
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:57,599
anti-emetic it's not um one that's

451
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:59,440
usually used for vomiting it's likely

452
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,158
could be helpful

453
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,880
in reducing anxiety with the syndrome

454
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,159
and possibly the pain but I doubt it

455
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,640
would be an effective preventive on its

456
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,760
own there are CBG only plants and

457
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,640
preparations that are available in

458
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:20,119
contrast to CBD which unless it was

459
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,640
developed from an isolate is is unlikely

460
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:26,639
you mentioned the acid cannabinoids thca

461
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,919
is antiemetic it uh helps reduce

462
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,000
vomiting uh but the problem is it's not

463
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,480
stable and uh it's breakdown product is

464
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,880
THC so one sees the pitfall there

465
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,720
potentially how about cbda cannabidiolic

466
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,600
acid so this is uh CBD before it's

467
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,600
decarbox in animals that has a strong

468
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:51,678
anti-emetic effect um we don't have

469
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,199
enough information from anybody who's

470
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:59,159
tried this to know whether

471
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:03,080
cbda on its own might be um help ful in

472
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:05,880
this situation right now the only

473
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,359
effective treatment uh that will work in

474
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,679
the long-terms abstinence from Cannabis

475
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:13,599
or other agents that stimulate CB1 and

476
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,000
that includes synthetic

477
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,359
cannaboids uh because it's well

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,480
established in people that aren't using

479
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:23,839
herbal cannabis but have had CHS in

480
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,960
relation to the synthetic agents that

481
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:32,199
stimulate the CB1 receptor all right so

482
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,159
let's let's look forward so um you know

483
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,640
uh you have been right on the front

484
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,240
lines of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome

485
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,000
for the whole 20 years that we've been

486
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,038
looking at it you have been following

487
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,440
the research from the early days when it

488
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:51,599
was first um defined and described um

489
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:54,480
you have participated in most of the

490
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,558
early research so so you you know where

491
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,640
we're at

492
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:00,599
today um you have spent efforts through

493
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,840
this paper debunking the things that it

494
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:08,639
is not so that um we have a better grasp

495
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:10,879
of of what CH is CHS is both so that we

496
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,000
can research it and so we have good

497
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,840
information going throughout the

498
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,919
Cannabis scene um I'm curious to know

499
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,720
where you would like to see research

500
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,559
happen next to further our understanding

501
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,360
of CHS and hopefully relieve the

502
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,759
symptoms of the Cannabis enthusiasts

503
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:34,398
that are developing it sure so we have

504
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:36,960
plans now we'd like to um we're involved

505
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:39,439
in putting together a Consortium of

506
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,679
researchers to apply to the National

507
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,558
Institutes of Health for a grant to

508
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:49,159
study CHS in depth we would like to have

509
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:54,158
hundreds of patients who undergo the

510
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:56,278
genomic testing to look at the five Gene

511
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,240
candidates that we've identified and

512
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:02,000
possibly others uh additionally we'd

513
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,798
like to do metabolomic testing this

514
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,679
would involve a sample of saliva that's

515
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:12,038
analyzed for its chemical composition to

516
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,440
see if a CHS attack produces biochemical

517
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:17,919
changes that we can identify as

518
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,080
markers um so that would be part of it

519
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,960
additionally we need much better

520
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:27,558
investigation of the

521
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,038
psychiatric accompaniment to CHS which

522
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:32,038
we've mentioned

523
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:36,079
um the tendency towards addiction mood

524
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:40,200
disorders anxiety depression and others

525
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:43,439
um so that's the idea of the research it

526
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,919
would be very expensive so in this

527
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,480
instance uh we need a grant uh we'll try

528
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,240
the government um we'll see I'm not

529
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,759
confident that um there's going to be

530
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,919
great funding opportunities and biomed

531
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:02,679
research at a federal

532
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:06,919
level so um for people who are

533
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,960
interested to know more about CHS or

534
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,600
want to get involved clearly they're

535
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,960
shaping Fire episode 80 where you can

536
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,079
get in the in-depth look at CHS but what

537
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,120
if people want to get involved

538
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:22,519
financially in supporting their work

539
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,359
would they contact UM your company cros

540
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,759
science that way if they want to get

541
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:31,000
involved with funding sure um couple of

542
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,440
things first um the three papers that

543
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,720
we've published on canabo hyperemesis

544
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,360
syndrome are available free no copyright

545
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,960
problems because it's my personal

550
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,678
sis there there will also be Links at

551
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,640
the bottom of this video so you don't

552
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,360
have to write

553
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:06,360
and finally we have a website what is

554
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:09,639
CHS that's what- is-

555
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:12,839
cs.com that has a resource page with

556
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,120
links to the Articles again uh more

557
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:20,319
information at a nice level that I think

558
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:22,359
is easy to understand and um access to

559
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:26,519
the uh

560
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:29,599
CHS screening uh test uh that is

561

science and and sometimes scientists

568
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,398
don't get involved with the the

569
