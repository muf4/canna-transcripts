00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:10,768
the breeding of cannabis seeds is

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,809
elegant and thoughtful and inspired and

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,580
we've talked about that here before but

5
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:17,160
actually doing the work to bring those

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,539
seeds to market can be brutal

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,309
after you go through the work of

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,289
carefully crafting and breeding your

9
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,719
seed stock you still have to sort and

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,400
quality check thousands of seeds design

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,009
packaging and haven't manufactured

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,959
assemble the final product Rock the

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,059
social media to reach out and inspire

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,429
fans reach out to stores and online

15
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,649
retailers to carry your seeds travel all

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,329
across the country to attend shows pay

17
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,219
extra for everything because you're a

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,100
cannabis company and deal with thieves

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,230
and grifters and folks wanting to test

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,120
your seeds and this is all before you've

21
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,578
been paid even a dime for any of your

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,299
breeding talent any kind of startup is

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,460
hard I know

24
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,198
but a new cannabis seed startup is

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,149
usually a one-person job until the

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,429
company grows enough to hire help it's

27
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,170
grueling hours lots of travel and it

28
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,269
requires an incredible amount of

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,219
patience if you want to learn about

30
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,868

to the show Eric hey thanks for having

77
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:44,299
me I appreciate it well you know let's

78
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,680
let's go ahead and start right at the

79
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,719
beginning right because part of what we

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,060
want to talk about today is is the arc

81
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,370
that somebody who wants to start a seed

82
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,430
company would take from deciding that

83
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,569
they want to you know climb this hill

84
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,000
versus you know when they were starting

85
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,280
to win cups so so where did you learn

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,050
your skills did you have a have a mentor

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,990
or an internship how did you get into

88
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,750
the scene you know basically from the

89
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,270
time I was a young kid on I think I just

90
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,639
had a really a very piqued interest in

91
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,430
cannabis I was you know I was turned on

92
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,989
to it by a neighbor who he showed me

93
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,849
some killer herb and he was very into

94
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,439
High Times Magazine back he kind of

95
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,659
showed me that kind of got me going and

96
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,159
I really started focusing a lot of my

97
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,829
attention on to the different strains

98
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,870
and and all these different varieties of

99
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,590
you know canvassed around the world I

100
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,080
think it was until I hooked up with a

101
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,360
guy that introduced me to que estés from

102
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,820
granddaddy that I that I really took a

103
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,260
stance toward the breeding aspect I

104
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,969
thought about it before it was never

105
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,899
really something that I've considered I

106
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,430
always thought it was gonna be a lot

107
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,709
harder and I left that up for the pros

108
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,739
to do so it was kind of out of sight out

109
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,539
of mind but working with granddaddy it

110
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,090
kind of it kind of opened up the doors

111
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:57,769
it showed me you know what what people

112
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,599
were after I I knew I wanted to create

113
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,939
things that I wanted to smoke and I

114
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,099
figure if I'm putting things out that I

115
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:06,310
like to smoke other people would enjoy

116
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:08,719
it as well so that's sort of how it went

117
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,270
he he had some falling out with some

118
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:17,988
employees and so I was upgraded from a

119
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:21,290
seed rep and online you know sales guy

120
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:23,089
to full-blown breeder for kin and so

121
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,780
that that that sort of put a fire under

122
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:27,679
my ass and and really brought the light

123
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,329
on the whole suit

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,978
you Asian you know I think that's a good

125
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:33,319
thing to point out to that you started

126
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:35,418
at the bottom right you started doing

127
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,490
sales for somebody else there's a lot of

128
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:39,258
people who who want to get into well

129
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,210
every part of this industry they want to

130
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:43,220
start at the top right and it's like no

131
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,779
man you know a lot of people you start

132
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,970
at the bottom and you learn your skills

133
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:49,459
that way when you go ahead to start your

134
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,320
own business you've already done all the

135
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:54,049
jobs from you know sweeten sweeping the

136
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,750
floors all the way up and it gives you

137
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,639
better skills to run the company so so

138
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,269
when you were you know air quotes

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,910
breeding at at granddaddy what did that

140
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:08,269
actually involved were you doing big

141
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:12,139
sips or was this more like manufacturing

142
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:14,478
lines that were pre-existing I came on

143
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:18,050
board with literally absolutely nothing

144
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:20,538
we had we had all of our original clone

145
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,220
stock was stripped from us the guys who

146
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:25,129
were working with him out in Oakland and

147
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,900
NorCal they all literally left one day

148
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,339
they just every that everyone grabbed

149
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,859
their [ __ ] and left and just left him

150
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:33,079
high and dry so it was it was it was a

151
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,060
weird situation and he knew that he was

152
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,680
a you know we had a very popular brand

153
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,959
we were doing really well at attitude

154
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,069
seedbank

155
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,049
he needed some help so I basically

156
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,569
started over with everything I had we

157
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,139
had we had our GDP line which we were

158
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:50,029
most known for so I used a GDP male and

159
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,280
another male which was a Tahoe G times

160
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:54,739
granddaddy purp and that that was our

161
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,109
pretty much our our bread and butter and

162
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,400
that started the whole new line we did I

163
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,199
did I think 11 or 12 new strains for him

164
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,299
recreated the Candy Land which was lost

165
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,030
they they they lost that one completely

166
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,639
so what I redid it and again made it you

167
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:12,019
know sold out right on you know it's

168
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
kind of funny a lot of people say oh you

169
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:15,889
know somebody or other they got they got

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,300
a break right and it's like yeah this

171
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,150
you definitely got a break but you had

172
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,310
already been there for a long time slang

173
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,658
in somebody else's seeds and you just

174
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,430
happen to be there for the break right

175
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:26,719
and that's you know people say oh that's

176
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,050
luck well you know that's putting in

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,150
your time oh yeah no I start at the

178
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,139
bottom I was there was there were there

179
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:38,839
was uh years two three plus years of me

180
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,180
literally not getting paid anything but

181
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,659
seeds and then getting to you know I got

182
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,790
to keep

183
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,040
part of my sales but that sales are made

184
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,500
by me driving around all over the state

185
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,629
and you know hitting the hitting the

186
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,310
stores hard you know back when medical

187
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,409
days was going on so I was hitting up

188
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,750
every single store from Olympia to

189
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,640
Seattle and above there trying to sell

190
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,379
them seed so it was one of those things

191
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,209
like I had to put a lot of time and

192
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,240
effort in before I was even granted the

193
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,029
that the opportunity to breed for him

194
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,050
and even then that came with a lot of

195
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,309
you know there was a lot of things

196
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,840
attached to it you know and a lot of

197
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:17,420
drama and a lot of things that you might

198
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:18,919
not expect so I kind of had a not not a

199
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,560
shoe-in that's definitely not the word

200
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,449
to say but I kind of had we since we

201
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,079
already had a good thing going I it

202
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,279
couldn't have been

203
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,750
it couldn't worked out better is what

204
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,429
I'm getting at because we we had already

205
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,779
had the ball was already rolling whereas

206
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,000
if someone who was just getting started

207
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:33,769
it's gonna be a hell of a lot harder to

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,509
just pop up in the scene bag hi I'm a

209
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,889
new breeder take my stuff you know it's

210
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:38,750
you it takes a little bit to get

211
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,689
accepted yeah yeah yeah and it's funny

212
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,120
how much staying in cannabis is not

213
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,829
getting sucked into drama especially you

214
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,980
know in the seed scene right there's so

215
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:50,329
much drama in seeds that that a lot of

216
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,930
the work is actually not getting

217
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:57,469
yourself sucked into that politics very

218
00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:00,860
much so I mean it's a I I might have a

219
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:03,260
little bit of a problem to keep in my

220
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,389
mouse at at times because it's hard you

221
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,639
you have so so many people that want to

222
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,829
give their opinion and say something

223
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,360
completely negative or off-topic and

224
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:13,579
just basically just talk [ __ ] so it's

225
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,870
it's it's it's one of those things you

226
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:16,129
can be the bigger person and say you

227
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,759
know I'm not gonna say am I gonna

228
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,529
respond

229
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,269
give them the pleasure of it you know or

230
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:21,529
you can just like you know what I'm

231
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,699
gonna go different route I'm just gonna

232
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,229
be the guy that sticks up for himself

233
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,180
and and I'll just say what's on my mind

234
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,470
cuz I don't really even I care of people

235
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,668
think of me obviously but I want them to

236
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,110
know that I'm not gonna just be a

237
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:31,519
pushover if you have something to say

238
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,349
I'll say something right back I treat

239
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,788
people with you know as much respect as

240
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:38,509
you'll give me and we can all be friends

241
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:40,069
but it's it's very very drama-filled

242
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:41,418
industry I tell you what it's like it's

243
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,039
like high school over again there's

244
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:44,509
clicks there's people that they shaking

245
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,759
your hand you're talking everything's

246
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:50,269
all good as you walk away it's [ __ ] that

247
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:53,059
guy it really it really it really just

248
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,439
depends but yeah it's it's a good thing

249
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:55,429
it's probably best to just stay out of

250
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,810
the drama just kind of

251
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:58,519
focus on your brand I should probably

252
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:01,069
take my own advice a bit more but yeah

253
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,649
it's it's it's really it's cutthroat

254
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,390
industry man really is yeah so so at

255
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,370
some point you're working over at

256
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:10,159
granddaddy and you had this idea like

257
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,629
you know what I want to grow the kind of

258
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,639
stuff I want to breed the kind of stuff

259
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:15,679
that I want to smoke did that would that

260
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,199
happen early on when you were still

261
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,750
selling or did that did that idea occur

262
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,259
to you once you had already started

263
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,110
breeding at Ken's

264
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:27,439
I think a little bit of both really

265
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,990
because it he knowing what we want to

266
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,660
achieve and and my own knowledge he he

267
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,870
only gave me the opportunity I was given

268
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:38,179
based on him seeing how I I treated the

269
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,950
weed how I talked about it he could see

270
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:43,539
I was passionate I had a lot of

271
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,950
knowledge in the in the in the strain

272
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:48,769
history of strains excuse me

273
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,540
so he was very into my opinion and what

274
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,278
I could come up with and so I think he

275
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,778
was as soon as I started talking to him

276
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:54,919
and showing him he just trusted me from

277
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:56,240
the jump and knew that there was gonna

278
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,838
be some good things that came from it

279
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,278
and sure enough they did so we had some

280
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,770
good things come a lot of a lot of

281
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,049
really popular strains some of the lines

282
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,819
like I said before we're totally sold

283
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:09,109
out on attitude and and continued to be

284
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,080
as long as we could produce the seeds

285
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,159
they were gone so it was it was good was

286
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,170
there some time that there was an

287
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,208
overlap between when you started

288
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,860
dungeons vault and were still over at

289
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:21,649
granddaddy or did you do was there a

290
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,570
clean break between the two oh it was

291
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:26,600
100% clean break I mean I don't want to

292
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,278
get into too much of the the Nitty

293
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,170
Gritty of what happened but at the same

294
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:34,338
time it's a it's it's it's all over the

295
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:36,019
internet about what happened I was

296
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,420
working with Ken we had a big falling

297
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,828
out and it is just like any other job I

298
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,509
called him up and said hey you know what

299
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:43,399
this is me putting my resignation and I

300
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:45,528
wish you the best but I'm out and that

301
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,449
was that was when I immediately broke

302
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:50,269
ties with them it was December of 2014

303
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,339
when that happened and literally the

304
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:55,100
idea was already sparked in my head of

305
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,440
dungeons of all genetic scientists the

306
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,889
name around you know back in like 2009

307
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,850
to actually it was red eye and ready red

308
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:06,559
eyed yeah he I had joked him about it

309
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,269
and so it was as soon as I broke away

310
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,319
from Ken the idea was just it was

311
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,269
already there and I

312
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,340
jumped with it immediately all right so

313
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:16,220
let's let's take us back to that day so

314
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,889
so you you've decided that you are on

315
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,810
your own feet now and dungeons fault is

316
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:23,449
is going to be real as of today because

317
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:25,189
you had just given your notice what were

318
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,870
the things that you determine were the

319
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,790
first things that you needed to get done

320
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,799
because because obviously you need you

321
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:32,029
needed to not only get the brand up and

322
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,309
running but you also needed to get

323
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,110
something out to be able to make some

324
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:39,319
money at the same time so what were your

325
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,550
task priorities at that point well it's

326
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,470
that's a very question because that

327
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,389
that's kind of where the where I had a

328
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,680
little bit of trouble at early on stages

329
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:47,179
me starting a company and this is

330
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,719
exactly what I was telling you about

331
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:52,969
earlier anybody can make seeds but you

332
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,769
come to the market with them and all of

333
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,360
a sudden it's who are you and how did

334
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:58,519
you get this and who you know where'd

335
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,870
you get your stuff and how did you breed

336
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,579
these there's a ton of questions to come

337
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:07,789
with it but what really happened was I I

338
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:10,550
literally knew immediately that you know

339
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:12,409
I mean I have I had leftover stock that

340
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:14,659
wasn't you know taken from me

341
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:16,009
when I gave can a ton of stuff to go

342
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:18,079
sell and that was part of the reason we

343
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:20,779
had a big breakup because I never ended

344
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,700
up getting paid for you know a very

345
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,279
large quantity of seeds were going out

346
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,720
to to Europe so I never got my pay on

347
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,779
that so that was kind of what started

348
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,519
the whole you know split up but I still

349
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,529
had stock left over from granddaddy days

350
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,699
so basically I rebranded and then that

351
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:35,750
was part of the reason people were

352
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,300
having troubled me because they're like

353
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,500
well you broke away from granddaddy but

354
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,449
used to have the same strains as

355
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,860
granddaddy and you stole them which in

356
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,930
all reality I never stole a thing I

357
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,870
worked strange for him I did the work I

358
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:50,209
did everything under my roof with my

359
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,730
money my lights everything so nothing

360
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,680
was stolen but it was just odd for

361
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,879
people to see me coming out with the

362
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,349
same exact ones that I'd already

363
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,539
released under granite II so the biggest

364
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,639
priority for me at that time was get new

365
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:03,949
strains that separates yourself from him

366
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,169
from you know the whole the split needs

367
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,460
to happen and be completely clean you

368
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:08,990
know and have your own line that can

369
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,820
that you're coming out with with your

370
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,590
own ideas your own strains you did and

371
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,360
with no one else's into it and that's

372
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,160
exactly what I did yeah I can see how

373
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,500
that would be you know both confusing

374
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,209
because because you're feeling legit you

375
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,549
weren't feeling guilty at all or that

376
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,110
you had done something wrong but but the

377
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,750
buying Publix all like hey man this is

378
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,419
kind of weird right so so as fast as you

379
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:32,539
could put those strains behind you and

380
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:35,299
have your own thing going the better so

381
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:36,259
so in those early days right well

382
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:37,699
actually let's let's start with the

383
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:39,620
ultra basic question where the name

384
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,090
comes up for dungeons of all genetics

385
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,590
cuz it's you know it's a pretty unique

386
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,560
thing you know it's not like you know

387
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,670
some kind of generic cannabis name like

388
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,969
there's so many of them where'd it come

389
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:52,299
no yeah no I don't know man I I swear

390
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,580
there's did for me

391
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:57,409
cannabis has been you know as some

392
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,940
people could say hallucinogens open the

393
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:00,679
doors for certain things for their art

394
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,650
or whatever well cannabis is made me a

395
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:05,659
very creative person I think really when

396
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,009
it comes down to names and even my stray

397
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:08,659
names or how I came up with dungeons of

398
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,129
all it's all it's all comes together

399
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:11,779
with me just sitting around and smoking

400
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:13,879
a joint or just thinking to myself about

401
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,159
how what sounds good or what sounds cool

402
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,919
let me say this right now I am NOT a

403
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,719
Dungeons &amp; Dragons fan I don't mind if

404
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,399
you if you play Dungeons &amp; Dragons

405
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,840
whether you were a child and played it

406
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,759
and loved it or you're into it as an

407
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,350
adult that's fine but I just that was

408
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,500
not my thing I never really rolled those

409
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,120
dice but dungeons and dungeons vault

410
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,399
genetics was something that came up like

411
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,139
I said back in that he was oh nine I was

412
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,789
online I was I was making a joke about

413
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,350
all these guys that were talking about

414
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,819
starting up a seed company I was like oh

415
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,200
this satis and you guys are all just

416
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,420
kind of started oh my might as well do

417
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,129
it too and I said I must start dungeons

418
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:48,049
of all genetics and it was literally a

419
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,399
joke like I was joking when I said it

420
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,169
but I really had thought about the name

421
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,449
I thought it was a cool name but I was

422
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:57,229
already working with Ken at granddaddy

423
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,640
and I had no no desire to leave at the

424
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,930
time you know everything was fine we

425
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,129
were doing great we were killing it so

426
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:05,329
that I had no no plan on leaving but

427
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,009
over time it just started making more

428
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,710
and more sense but that's literally it's

429
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,179
just I can't say a ton of thought went

430
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,680
into it just just enough to I thought

431
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,449
the name was cool and I just wanted to

432
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,009
really think about you know man I guess

433
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,500
really if you think about the done a

434
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:20,480
dungeon is a cool dark place where they

435
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,009
keep you know prisoners so nothing about

436
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,210
cannabis has to do with you know we

437
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,470
don't wanna think about being locked up

438
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,840
and that's not really what I was going

439
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,519
with but the dungeon is a place that's

440
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,009
you know it's it's locked up it's kept

441
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,529
it's it's under control you know so the

442
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:35,450
vault even even more so it's a locked up

443
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,439
vault it's in the dungeon it's kept away

444
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,080
it's to seek its

445
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,940
secret place whatever so those strange

446
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,110
those genetics are kept up and locked up

447
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,400
and now they're being released to the

448
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,120
community so that's kind of where I was

449
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,439
going with it

450
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,389
yeah right on that makes a lot of sense

451
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,720
and it's funny that it just started as

452
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:52,819
an online you know STONER joke but then

453
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,200
yeah day came that you needed a name or

454
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,420
like [ __ ] I guess I already have a

455
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,129
name let's just go with it exactly I

456
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:00,229
mean it really it was as simple as that

457
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,730
I said Wow well this couldn't work it's

458
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,620
funny that's how life works sometimes

459
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,840
some you you think about something or

460
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,879
you put an idea down on paper and and

461
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,960
you you might look at it a couple times

462
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,460
here never you don't really think that

463
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,720
it's going to actually be something that

464
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,110
happens and then all of a sudden it just

465
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,330
it's when the time's right things work

466
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,830
together but I always say things happen

467
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,220
for a reason and this this worked out

468
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:24,800
and it's worked out for the better so so

469
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,310
I've only seen your your seed packaging

470
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:31,219
for say like the last three seasons or

471
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:32,299
so and and the art were I mean it's but

472
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,009
it's pulled together right we'll talk

473
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,779
more about packaging itself in in a

474
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:37,970
couple minutes but like as far as like

475
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,610
the graphic design of your brand you

476
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,230
know you can tell when I see a pack of

477
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,409
seeds I can tell it's yours that your

478
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,750
stuff has all got a similar aesthetic to

479
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:50,120
it is that something that you developed

480
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,100
yourself or do you work closely with a

481
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,310
graphic designer who's helping you know

482
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,899
you kind of line all this stuff up a

483
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:58,729
little bit of both actually you know so

484
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:02,149
let me only answer a few different ways

485
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,830
so originally the dvg logo my shield

486
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,109
logo and the script logo that has become

487
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,299
so popular that's on every one of my

488
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,369
packaging on my clothing everything was

489
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:14,509
actually done by the breeder at bay

490
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:16,068
exclusives my buddy who Bay exclusive

491

492
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,629
Oregon he he worked with me very closely

493
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,370
he's a good friend of mine he designed

494
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,810
the dvg logo for me and we kind of

495
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,539
talked about and he helped me get the

496
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,129
get that going so he did that logo for

497
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:31,849
me and then everything after that I

498
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:34,520
worked very closely with with a graphic

499
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:36,259
artist I have locally and then he does

500
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:38,869
all the print and excuse me but then did

501
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:40,910
my designer is actually 420 friendly

502
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:42,979
illustrations and he's the guy that's

503
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,140
been doing a lot of my art recently and

504
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,900
has helped with my citrus farmer logo

505
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,940
that dr. gonzo the full-metal-jacket and

506
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,600
he'll continue to help me with these

507
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,140
designs

508
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:56,269
he's an incredible artist with crazy

509
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,830
talent it's nice to that you can get

510
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:59,660
people that have gotten mad talent

511
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:01,220
freelance right cuz like you know yeah

512
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,860
when a company gets big enough sure you

513
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,079
can bring designers in-house but but

514
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:08,000
it's nice to be able to to work with

515
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,129
somebody who that you respect and

516
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,900
produces good work but not necessarily

517
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,280
have to pay them for all of their time

518
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,130
you can pay them for the time that you

519
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,950
need them yeah exactly I mean it good if

520
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,030
you had a full-time artist on deck that

521
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,590
was sitting there and always I mean I

522
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:24,710
would be paying so much stinking money

523
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:27,589
but what it really comes down to is each

524
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,940
design this guy does it's he's doing

525
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:30,859
he's doing a ton of work for other

526
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,259
people so when I need something done I

527
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:35,029
give him some notice in advance we sit

528
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:36,798
there we talk about what the concept is

529
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:39,200
and then we shoot back and forth ideas

530
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,700
and I swear it's like by the time it's

531
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,830
done it's like get out of my head you

532
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,298
you he literally it's so perfect and

533
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:46,038
it's so exactly what I wanted to

534
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:50,298
represent that I couldn't I couldn't ask

535
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:52,339
for a better artist really right not

536
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:53,629
good that's an awesome shout out so hey

537
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,369
let's go ahead and take our first short

538
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,840
break and be right back you're listening

539

to shaping fire and my guest today is

540
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,089
Eric Weber founder of dungeons of all

541
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,009
genetics as a listener of shaping fire

542
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:06,439
you already understand the importance of

543
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,269
living soil when growing cannabis when

544
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,490
you have active microbe communities in

545
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:12,529
your substrate you go way beyond simply

546
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,259
fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and

547
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:17,269
potassium having active microorganisms

548
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,099
in your substrate supports vigorous

549
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,900
plant growth throughout the plants root

550
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:23,719
zone making for higher yields and

551
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,880
thriving flowers mammoth pee is the

552
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,009
first organically derived microbial

553
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,380
inoculant that focuses on your plants

554
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:32,419
nutrient cycling processes to release

555
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,309
soil phosphorus and other micronutrients

556
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:37,159
from they're bound forms making them

557
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:38,658
more available to the plant increased

558
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,760
levels of phosphorus will also keep

559
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,159
internode shorter and focus your plants

560
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,470
energy on bud production not only that

561
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:46,820
but the microbes act as a defense shield

562
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,860
for the plants rhizosphere

563
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,379
by out competing potentially harmful

564
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:53,240
pathogenic microbes pretty cool right

565
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,400

nutrients in your soil but it also helps

567
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,259
protect your plant from disease mammoth

568
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:03,558
pees beneficial bacteria act like

569
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:04,129
microbial reactors continually producing

570
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:06,769
ends

571
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,690
that release nutrients mammoth pee was

572
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:10,910
developed at a u.s. university has been

573
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,279

is proven to increase growth and enhance

576

blooming one of the great things about

577
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:21,199
supplementing with microorganisms is

578
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,700
that they won't compete with whatever

579

00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,950
you know because because people are into

655
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:24,048
their cannabis and and so you seem like

656
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,778
you have to put out a hell of a lot of

657
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:28,700
energy when you're working I mean just

658
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:31,429
selling seeds itself working a booth

659
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,139
itself is exhausting but since you're

660
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:35,090
the guy that a lot of people are there

661
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:39,648
to see you seem to have to like work

662
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:43,128
double how grueling is that man it's I

663
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:45,048
tell you if you wouldn't think that just

664
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:46,849
standing there or even if I'm sitting

665
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,349
down just sitting there at an event to

666
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:50,778
sit there and tell people oh my god I'm

667
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:52,128
so so tired from the like you stood

668
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:53,839
there and talked to people and smoked

669
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:55,730
weed all day how [ __ ] bad is that

670
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,878
really it sounds pretty easy to me but

671
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,259
yeah really when you are talking to that

672
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:02,000
many people I mean I've never done a

673
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,500
count on how many people come through a

674
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,849
booth or even at those events but

675
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,119
there's enough there that by end of the

676
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:09,798
day I've barely left the booth enough to

677
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,469
go use a restroom or get myself

678
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,418
something to drink really quick or I

679
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,370
yeah that's that's really I don't get to

680
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,019
walk around very much my voice has gone

681
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:21,469
by end of the day or by end of the

682
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:24,558
weekend but I I i did i made this brand

683
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,360
by myself i do a lot of this stuff with

684
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,099
friends if you see people at the booth

685
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,959
they're usually friends of mine or guys

686
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,369
that i work with a tester who i've

687
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,200
become great friends with who

688
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,969
show up at these events and help me out

689
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,980
but for the most part I do everything

690
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,140
myself and I like to talk to the people

691
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,640
I like to be the one behind the booth

692
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,800
selling the seeds I'd like to do

693
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,750
everything I have my hands on everything

694
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,058
and know what's being said because I

695
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,319
want my company represented in a good

696
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:49,789
way and I want people to walk away

697
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,470
knowing that they had their questions

698
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,639
answered and Oran that they have all the

699
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,380
knowledge they needed when they made

700
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,300
that purchase I mean let's be real here

701
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,370
no matter how much money you make if you

702
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:01,849
spend any sort of amount of money on

703
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:03,319
seeds not only are you investing that

704
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:04,519
money that it's hard-earned money but

705
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:06,279
you are going to invest a lot of time

706
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:07,940
into those things so you want to know

707
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:09,678
anything that you want to know about

708
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,240
that strain should be answered at that

709
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,679
booth by a knowledgeable staff and if I

710
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,529
don't have someone there that I know can

711
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,970
they answer that question with 100%

712
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:19,879
confidence and I'll be right there

713
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:22,220
standing behind them helping anything I

714
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,690
can would you find that the kind of

715
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,350
questions that people ask you at the

716
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:29,808
booth are almost entirely about the the

717
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:31,129
seeds and cannabis botany and how to

718
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,960
grow them and verus those kind of

719
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,840
specifics or do you find that that

720
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,610
actually you know that's a lesser amount

721
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,049
of the questions and lots of people

722
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,149
actually want to like you know get

723
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:43,039
selfies with you and just talk shop or

724
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,630
or get you know tell you tell you how

725
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,670
much they love citrus farm or like like

726
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,590
how much of it is like people like

727
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,320
really needing to know that kind of

728
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:53,149
information it's it's a little bit it's

729
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,579
mixed because you have people that come

730
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,350
by you get you get the mom-and-pop that

731
00:25:55,579 --> 00:26:00,079
have literally now that cannabis has

732
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:01,699
become so accepted they are finally

733
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,139
making their way to an event like wow

734
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,700
I've never done this before can you tell

735
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,200
me a little about your seeds or oh I

736
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,730
didn't even know they sold these things

737
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,610
or whether they've heard of them or not

738
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,470
they might come by excuse me and they

739
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:15,889
want to have a little conversation about

740
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:17,329
how you know you know seeds have become

741
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:20,390
so popular and how people are growing

742
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:22,308
them to the the novice farmer to the guy

743
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,390
that just yeah they do want advice they

744
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:25,670
want to know everything that's going on

745
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,340
with the strains and you know how I grow

746
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:30,019
what's my choice for nutrients all that

747
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,759
stuff and then yeah you got the people

748
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:33,829
that come by that are fans you know the

749
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,200
Instagram fans or people that are just

750
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:37,730
you know buddies and and people you've

751
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,950
seen at different shows and they come by

752
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,539
to say hello and and shake your hand or

753
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,860
you just stop by and smoke a joint but

754
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,299
that's that gets into the whole thing

755
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,769
you asked earlier I'm so busy at those

756
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,389
talking to people and trying to make

757
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:50,940
sure everything's flowing correctly that

758
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,800
I rarely have time to I mean even when

759
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,330
you came by last time I was trying I

760
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,440
could see you stand there I want to say

761
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,569
hi to you but I'm in the middle of a

762
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,370
conversation and how rude to just walk

763
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:00,659
away from a conversation and then ignore

764
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,769
that person so I have to do everything I

765
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,380
can to make sure everyone feels

766
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:06,690
respected and that they are being taken

767
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,250
care of and then I can step away and say

768
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,019
hello to someone or try and talk to some

769
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,000
people so at times it can be hard

770
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:13,680
because I've only got a couple of people

771
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,420
working my booth with me and sometimes I

772
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,880
would really rather be the one talking

773
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,430
yeah yeah I get that and and certainly

774
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,590
when I see you at events I know that

775
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,870
your job there is to sell you know and

776
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:26,339
and and and when and when you you know

777
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:28,439
you didn't have time for me immediately

778
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:30,089
I did a loop and I came back and you had

779
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,009
more time and you know we said hey then

780
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:35,519
but I think yeah I think it's important

781
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:38,099
for people who are you know who are who

782
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,049
are fans but not particularly planning

783
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:41,849
on buying that day they have to

784
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:44,159
understand that they need to like step

785
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:45,919
aside so that the person who's got you

786
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,450
know a hundred dollar bill in their hand

787
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,740
gets your attention because that's you

788
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,450
know that's that's why the whole thing

789
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,670
can continues because that sales gonna

790
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,769
happen you know yes yes and that's part

791
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:58,259
of the reason why I made these laminated

792
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:59,549
menus now so I can just when I'm talking

793
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,109
to someone I can see out the corner of

794
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,579
my eye that someone wants to talk to me

795
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:05,189
or someone wants to ask a question so I

796
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:06,899
can just very very politely hand them a

797
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,070
menu so they can see what's going on and

798
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,590
they can hopefully have a question

799
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:11,909
answer that I can continue to show this

800
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:14,669
other person the respect they deserve

801
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,800
and continue their conversation until

802
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:20,580
they walk away but yeah I agree with us

803
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,500
we can just try and shuttle the people

804
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,579
that want to talk aside and let the

805
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,170
people they're looking to buy and

806
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,879
another aisle that's that's what I

807
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,200
should be doing but you know it's it's

808
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,850
nice to talk to everyone he always sees

809
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,730
fans and friends from from every show so

810
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:35,279
it's cool so so I know that you know the

811
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,529
shows on the west coast are chill and

812
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,170
pretty easy but I'm assuming that you

813
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:42,359
spend a lot of time in the newer states

814
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:45,630
as well like you know Michigan for

815
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:48,319
example and you know how sketchy is it

816
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:51,030
going into some of these newer states

817
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:53,669
carrying you know not only all of your

818
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,500
product to sell at the event but also

819
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,269
like you know your personal stash

820
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,419
because I you know you're clearly not

821
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:00,038
going to be you know

822
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:02,470
you know have a medical card in all

823
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,720
these states and the laws are changing I

824
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,100
would think that with you know

825
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,239
everything that all that you know

826
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:10,349
everything you on the line that that

827
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:13,058
could get pretty sketched sometimes I

828
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:14,738
I've got a few stories from airports

829
00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:18,220
that are pretty comical but ya know for

830
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:21,429
the most part they they really don't

831
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,528
seeds are really they don't care TSA and

832
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:25,600
and most of the people have made it very

833
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,819
clear that that's not something they're

834
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,730
concerned with so me traveling with

835
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:33,819
seeds so far hasn't been an issue I

836
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:36,429
would say once you start bringing you

837
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:37,778
know certain amounts of weed with you on

838
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:39,970
the plane or whatever you might want to

839
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:41,349
be careful but for the most part I kind

840
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,850
of leave all that [ __ ] behind and let

841
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:44,349
people know hey I'm traveling from other

842
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:46,298
states so the reason I don't have ten

843
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,469
jars with a quarter pound in each jar so

844
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,849
you can smell everything and make a

845
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,710
judgement on what you want to buy is

846
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:53,259
because a I don't want to go to jail for

847
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,058
this and it's just not it's just not

848
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:57,128
logical it's just there's really no way

849
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:59,769
to do it so unless I'm driving across

850
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:01,148
state lines and even then same thing I

851
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:02,888
can't be bringing weed across state

852
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:05,949
lines that way either so it's really

853
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:07,508
it's funny man you got to really build

854
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,679
your brand and let people know what you

855
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:10,450
got because if they're if they're

856
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,369
counting on smelling a jar to make their

857
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:16,179
third choice it's going to be hard for

858
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:18,128
them but yeah it's it's it's it's so far

859
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:20,440
for me going to the other States has

860
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:23,230
been incredible I mean Michigan honestly

861
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,940
one of my favorite places to go they I'm

862
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,558
so well-received there and I've got

863
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,590
nothing but love for Michigan those guys

864
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,239
show me so much support up there even

865
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:33,158
more so than any other state honestly I

866
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:36,119
think more than California more than

867
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:38,440
Oregon more than more than Colorado

868
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:40,058
Michigan has my back and is there's a

869
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,249
huge supporter of all things done she's

870
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:44,950
also big shout out to Michigan farmers

871
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:46,899
right on right on and and you know it's

872
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,759
funny too because you know so many of us

873
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:51,069
on the west coast between you know

874
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:52,868
having medical for almost 20 years

875
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:55,058
depending on where you are on the west

876
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:57,189
coast you know a lot of us have gotten

877
00:30:55,058 --> 00:31:01,298
used to what it's like to be around

878
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:03,340
easily-accessible top shelf weed and and

879
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:04,989
you know feeling generally safe that

880
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:06,638
we're not gonna get in trouble but you

881
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:08,619
know I'm actually from Michigan so like

882
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:11,289
when I go home to visit my family and I

883
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:14,049
see friends from back in the day

884
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:16,210
and uh you know the fact that they now

885
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:17,589
have got you know more advanced medical

886
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,190
and they're getting you know cool

887
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:23,799
products out there to see it reflected

888
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,680
in their eyes being so recently out of

889
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:29,500
prohibition it reminds me to be grateful

890
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,240
that I live on the west coast and that

891
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,400
I've even taken some of this stuff for

892
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,140
granted at this point because I'm around

893
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,880
it every day but you know you go back

894
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,620
behind the prohibition curtain and

895
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,300
people are all like man I can't even

896
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:44,199
believe I can buy this stuff legally you

897
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:46,240
know ya know it's it's it's times of

898
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,220
changing it wasn't it wasn't long ago

899
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,599
that I was arrested for a possession of

900
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,460
marijuana charge here in Washington

901
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,750
State and I remember asking the state

902
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,309
trooper I said man you guys are crazy

903
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,200
when you're gonna just [ __ ] legalize

904
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:56,589
the stuff and he said 90 times soon

905
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,539
buddy

906
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:02,559
well that wasn't that long ago and here

907
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:04,720
we are so it's it's pretty funny so you

908
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,059
know we were talking about the the laws

909
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,860
around the seeds and and that the TSA

910
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:11,829
really doesn't care all that much and

911
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:15,879
you know people in the you know in the

912
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:18,789
olden days like five years ago you know

913
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,310
they didn't want to ship seeds into the

914
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:23,529
US and then people in the US didn't

915
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:26,559
really want to ship seeds from state to

916
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:29,170
state but now like lots of people are

917
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,059
mailing seeds and and you know a lot of

918
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,710
people I ask like why do you feel safe

919
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:35,619
doing that they're like oh our seeds are

920
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:37,269
you know for souvenir only which doesn't

921
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:38,919
seem like it'd be a hustle that would

922
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:40,660
necessarily stand up in court

923
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,660
like what do you what are the rules

924
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:49,029
around shipping and selling seeds are

925
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:53,470
you really at any risk it the great

926
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:55,569
question it is is very very strange

927
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,640
because you've got so many different

928
00:32:55,569 --> 00:33:00,849
people with an opinion on on the

929
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,860
legalities of it and how you know like

930
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:04,089
how it all is playing out and you don't

931
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:05,979
even know what to think you know because

932
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:08,709
you got you got one person saying you

933
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,200
know it's its agricultural trash seeds

934
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,940
are not looked at as an item that is its

935
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,620
it shouldn't be it's not illegal you

936
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,840
know but then you got other people there

937
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:21,879
saying for instance at Kanak on this

938
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:23,500
last a couple few weeks ago the cannabis

939
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,000
Liquor Control Board came in and they

940
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,909
were saying that you know

941
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,700
sales in Washington state is illegal to

942
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:32,760
have seeds on my on my table was

943
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:37,120
essentially the same as having marijuana

944
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:39,759
displayed I mean very very strict when

945
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,989
it comes to the whole recreational side

946
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,849
of it because I think they're really

947
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,159
after the whole seed to sale thing and

948
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:47,740
they want to make sure that you know

949
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,270
they're getting theirs but it's very

950
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,798
weird because at the same time they're

951
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:53,650
telling me that it's illegal in this and

952
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:56,589
a blah blah blah but I've personally

953
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:59,409
been told and seen it written on paper

954
00:33:56,589 --> 00:34:01,720
that seeds do not have THC in them and

955
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:03,730
therefore are not illegal in are like I

956
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,500
said rather considered trash and or a

957
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,320
souvenir or whatever you'd like to do

958
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,929
with it but seed sales I think has

959
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,909
increased so much because like you

960
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:16,210
mentioned before five years ago even

961
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:17,590
more than that maybe was you you if you

962
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,320
weren't ordering your seats from

963
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,210
attitude seed bank or from say herb ease

964
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,090
head shop or ever you were wherever you

965
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:27,519
were getting them from there was all of

966
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:29,169
our sources were overseas and then

967
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,539
unless you knew a private breeder here

968
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:34,118
in town you know you could get some

969
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:35,469
stuff but the the varieties and all the

970
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,480
hybrids and everything that this come

971
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:39,219
out is is over the top it's it's

972
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,829
absolutely crazy and I would say that we

973
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:44,829
are we are very lucky to have so many

974
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:46,719
talented people in one area that we can

975
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:49,779
actually get what we are getting because

976
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,398
now what why would you ever order seeds

977
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,260
from another country at this point I

978
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:55,319
mean what you're gonna have the people

979
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,730
get their seeds taken from customs and

980
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,109
then who's to say you're even getting

981
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,400
what's you're paying for I mean that's

982
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:01,929
that's really any seed bank you order

983
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,690
from but we have guys with great

984
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:05,409
reputations here so it's just why risk

985
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,599
it anywhere else

986
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:10,088
yeah totally we've got mad mad talent

987
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,338
here in the states now so before we go

988
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:14,940
to our second break I want to ask you

989
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:17,949
about you know you have got a really

990
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:21,309
rabid following you know your followers

991
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:25,239
are hardcore and and you know sometimes

992
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:29,289
things can get pretty rambunctious on

993
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:32,649
your Instagram for example right and you

994
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:35,019
know how does that play into you know

995
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,510
your your bigger work right cuz like you

996
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:39,550
know essentially that is part of your

997
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,260
tizen right and so you're participating

998
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,119
with people and yeah you're teaching

999
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,730
them about your product but also you

1000
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,470
know you get you get like these jerks

1001
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,000
who show up and then suddenly people

1002
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:51,639
who's defending you and so like this

1003
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,670
this this if this thing explodes on your

1004
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:56,319
Instagram feed how do you you know how

1005
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,730
do you what's your perspective on that

1006
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,280
do you see that as just being like

1007
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,070
healthy and fun or you do try to have

1008
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,350
there not be much of it because because

1009
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,300
we go when you've got what 84,000

1010
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:11,469
followers and and everybody is

1011
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:15,310
passionate it tends to happen often you

1012
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:16,539
know what it's it's it's a yeah I kind

1013
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:19,119
of got into this earlier with you but

1014
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:22,000
it's it's it's weird because I want to

1015
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,400
be the guy who's I'm not gonna turn my

1016
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,980
cheek and get slapped again you know but

1017
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,420
the same time I think there's there is a

1018
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,539
point where you need to just kind of

1019
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:35,200
step back and and and either defuse the

1020
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:37,599
situation or just delete everything

1021
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,000
entirely and I have done that I I mean

1022
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,618
what the example you brought up there's

1023
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,179
a few times where I can think of where

1024
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:45,730
there was a post mate or there was

1025
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:47,799
something said and it led into just some

1026
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,990
hundred plus comments thing and yeah or

1027
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,400
I've got attack people that follow me

1028
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:53,469
attacking other people and then people

1029
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,380
this trolling me hard and in all reality

1030
00:36:53,469 --> 00:37:00,219
what good is it none but it does get me

1031
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,420
some some more people paying attention

1032
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,069
to the page than other people next thing

1033
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,750
you know I got I got more followers that

1034
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:06,400
are looking at things so sometimes it

1035
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,900
gets good it can be a curse and a

1036
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,750
blessing but but I think for the most

1037
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,670
part it's probably better to just keep

1038
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,920
your nose out of that [ __ ] and just let

1039
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,869
the let the troll pages and the meme

1040
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,130
pages handle all the huge arguments and

1041
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:21,220
you just kind of represent your brand

1042
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:23,920
that's that's more of the line I'm

1043
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:27,039
trying to take as of recently but at the

1044
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,500
same time I'm I'm a very passionate

1045
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,019
person I'm a very friendly guy but I'm

1046
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:36,789
also someone who's got you know a little

1047
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:39,940
bit of you know anger issues here and

1048
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:41,829
there so I can easily lose my cool and

1049
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,389
say things I don't mean or maybe I do

1050
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:45,009
mean at the time but just say things

1051
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:47,049
that might come across another person is

1052
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,390
a real jerky thing to say but in all

1053
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:51,340
reality I'm really just I'm not gonna

1054
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:53,980
let people walk on me I I

1055
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,570
I can appreciate the people that can you

1056
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,000
know let's let's all just get along and

1057
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,470
let's just all smoke a joint go hug a

1058
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,030
tree there's nothing wrong with that but

1059
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:02,589
at the same time sometimes people just

1060
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,210
need to get put in their place and be

1061
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,070
told that you know it don't it's just

1062
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,690
your comment was unnecessary I don't

1063
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,490
want to fricken hear it and then you got

1064
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,079
my the followers that they will

1065
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,669
literally go and I'm not telling them

1066
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,929
not telling people to go do these things

1067
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,849
and they will literally go and just

1068
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:18,279
light a fire under someone's ass and

1069
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:20,739
it's like oh my gosh I would you you had

1070
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,180
I had no idea the outcome of what some

1071
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:24,279
of these things are gonna do but it's

1072
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:26,589
just it's it's comical at times but yeah

1073
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,120
like I said if I see something for the

1074
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,160
most part I don't leave that kind of

1075
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,659
stuff up on my page I'll let it go for a

1076
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,149
little bit I'll speak my mind I'll say I

1077
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:36,639
need to say and then boom it's gone yeah

1078
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:39,130
yeah you know I came up with a term for

1079
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:42,879
that that I use with clients a lot I

1080
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:44,440
call it a spectacle marketing right it's

1081
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,360
it's it's you know it's something that

1082
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,690
happens like like a master of this is a

1083
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,910
Jonah to coma from dab stars right like

1084
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,490
he does these big things that are just

1085
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:56,409
like crazy and outrageous and and and

1086
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:58,539
people all want to watch it because it's

1087
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:00,759
like a house on fire or something right

1088
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:02,199
and and he gets everybody excited he

1089
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,270
milks it and then he just moves on to

1090
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:06,099
the next thing right and sometimes these

1091
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:06,429
these online fights can be the same

1092
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:08,589
thing

1093
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:10,239
you'd be like oh my god I can't believe

1094
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,070
like so and you kind of follow the

1095
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,469
thread throughout the day and then you

1096
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,610
know solos nobody gets truly violent

1097
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:18,089
with each other you know you can always

1098
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:19,990
just delete it down the line and move on

1099
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,970
exactly that's that's really what I've

1100
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:23,529
tried to do because I think that

1101
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:25,539
sometimes when I post something whether

1102
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,830
it be drama related or on I'm calling

1103
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:29,230
someone out for doing something stupid

1104
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:31,090
or whatever maybe I want people to see

1105
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,760
what I have to say but then it doesn't

1106
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:35,650
need to just be a on going thing once

1107
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,120
I've spoken my mind or I've said I want

1108
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,980
to say and and enough people have

1109
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,420
commented or seen it then they can go

1110
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,670
tell their friends or whatever that what

1111
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,829
they saw it's done at that point I mean

1112
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:47,349
I I I don't think anyone should just be

1113
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:49,420
allowed to be off you know let off the

1114
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:50,500
hook for soft stuff they do or say if

1115
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,630
you've said or done something that's

1116
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,739
really faulty then own up to it and if

1117
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,930
it's if you're gonna get caught out on

1118
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:57,219
social media you know I mean then that's

1119
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:59,169
it that's just that's how it is nowadays

1120
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:00,939
so be ready so keep your nose clean and

1121
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,380
don't say things you don't mean or or if

1122
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,090
you're gonna say things you don't that

1123
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,170
you do mean they get ready to back them

1124
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,980
up

1125
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:12,880
yeah totally so so it's it is funny so

1126
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:14,289
so after the f9 yeah after the break

1127
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,260
I wanted we're gonna talk more about

1128
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:18,909
your particular strain lineage but but

1129
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,299
one more question before we go to that

1130
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:25,838
break you know I I have heard you talk

1131
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:27,460
about testers a lot about you know the

1132
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,869
kind of attributes that you like in a

1133
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,838
tester and the kind of people that

1134
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:34,420
deserve to receive test seeds and then

1135
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,578
and then all the yahoos that just waste

1136
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,470
your seeds and you never hear from them

1137
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:39,910
again so you know there's there's

1138
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,098
clearly a lot of people who are

1139
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:43,779
listening today who would love to be a

1140
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,359
tester for you or for somebody else

1141
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,700
right you know what what do you see as

1142
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:50,969
being the attributes of a good tester

1143
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:54,368
and how should somebody approach a

1144
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:55,959
breeder so that they get you know so

1145
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,960
they start off on the right foot

1146
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,210
I have literally gone about this in so

1147
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,909
many ways that I don't even know I at

1148
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,059
this point I'm gonna start doing face to

1149
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:08,230
face interviews like I don't I'm joking

1150
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:10,150
but I literally don't I don't know what

1151
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,039
to do because I've tried it I've I've

1152
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,048
literally done it this way where I look

1153
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:15,489
at someone I say okay this guy's got X

1154
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:17,230
amount of followers he obviously has

1155
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:23,169
people checking out his page he grows

1156
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:25,780
good weed he he's very he's very you

1157
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,889
know he's on Instagram a lot he's spent

1158
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,119
a lot of time on there and showing

1159
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:30,219
people what he's doing so that's the

1160
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,088
kind of person I would think would be my

1161
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:37,568
ideal tester in and I say I think within

1162
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:39,009
parenthesis because that's really that's

1163
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:40,960
what I thought would be good then you

1164
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:43,240
got guys that have a very very low

1165
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,010
falling with you know hardly any

1166
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:47,048
followers at all but they grow killer

1167
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,790
bud and all they are trying to do is is

1168
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:52,480
get their foot in the door so they can

1169
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:55,150
hopefully one day you know be more are

1170
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,030
like a permanent tester or be have some

1171
00:41:55,150 --> 00:42:00,730
sort of way to get into this industry

1172
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,290
and if being someone's grower and and

1173
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,780
helping them test strains and all of a

1174
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:06,579
sudden you they've I've used ten of that

1175
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,260
guy's photos on my page to advertise my

1176
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:10,510
brand guess what he's probably made it

1177
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,160
into a spot where I will always hit him

1178
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:14,170
up maybe even invite him out for a cup

1179
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,358
to come hang out and you know come meet

1180
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,650
the guys and and really you know get get

1181
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:18,788
more strains to grow out himself

1182
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,499
whatever but

1183
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:21,819
I'm looking to build relationships with

1184
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:24,938
these people you know I don't want I

1185
00:42:21,818 --> 00:42:25,478
don't want some some girl or guy excuse

1186
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:28,028
me

1187
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:30,338
grown for me and me never even known who

1188
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:31,958
they are just having some online persona

1189
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:33,639
I want to know who you are I want to

1190
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:35,228
engage with you I want to know how

1191
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:37,028
they're growing I want to know what you

1192
00:42:35,228 --> 00:42:39,068
got going on and it seems to me that

1193
00:42:37,028 --> 00:42:41,259
there's too many people that are they're

1194
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:42,699
so quick to jump in line oh I want to

1195
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:44,858
test you all do this I'll do that all

1196
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:47,679
they promise everything from the moon

1197
00:42:44,858 --> 00:42:49,719
and back and then they don't do what

1198
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,999
they say they're going to do now there

1199
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,429
are there are circumstances that happen

1200
00:42:51,998 --> 00:42:56,708
and you got a you know be understanding

1201
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:58,449
because everybody doesn't have an easy

1202
00:42:56,708 --> 00:43:00,009
life there's things that pop up things

1203
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:02,679
happen you know there's all sorts of

1204
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:04,179
stuff out of our control but what I see

1205
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:07,660
happening more times than not is is

1206
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:09,130
people asking and or begging for seeds

1207
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:10,358
and then they don't even do anything

1208
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,278
with them they stay put them in their

1209
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:13,478
stash or maybe they do grow them but

1210
00:43:12,278 --> 00:43:14,829
they don't ever tell me about it because

1211
00:43:13,478 --> 00:43:16,149
they just wanted something new so they

1212
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:18,009
have something that sets them apart from

1213
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,568
their their friend who's growing you

1214
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:23,438
know something that everyone already has

1215
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:25,469
right now yeah it's very loose yeah and

1216
00:43:23,438 --> 00:43:29,649
probably super hella frustrating too

1217
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:31,298
yeah yeah so hey let's go ahead and take

1218
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,499
that break we're gonna take a short

1219
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:34,298
break and be right back you're listening

1220
00:43:32,498 --> 00:43:36,308
to shaping fire and my guest today is

1221
00:43:34,298 --> 00:43:39,159
Eric Weber founder of dungeons of all

1222
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:41,199
genetics using pesticides when growing

1223
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:43,809
cannabis has been common for a long time

1224
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,179
nowadays though we know better we know

1225
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:47,829
that most pesticides formulated for food

1226
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:50,019
crops have never been tested for use

1227
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:52,419
with cannabis they've been tested to be

1228
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:54,698
eaten in tiny doses they have not been

1229
00:43:52,418 --> 00:43:56,788
tested to be inhaled and especially not

1230
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:59,168
concentrated into a cannabis oil

1231
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:00,880
chemical residues from pesticides are

1232
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:03,368
not healthy for anyone but they are

1233
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,019
especially dangerous for patients for

1234
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:07,329
commercial cannabis growers this has

1235
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:09,098
become very impactful cannabis

1236
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:11,739
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

1237
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:14,709
educated enough that they avoid growers

1238
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:16,358
who used pesticides not only that but

1239
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:18,639
states across the country have begun

1240
00:44:16,358 --> 00:44:22,179
making pesticide testing mandatory on

1241
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:23,679
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

1242
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:25,809
come to find a better way to fight

1243
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,699
garden pests than covering your cannabis

1244
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:32,330

beneficial insects and predatory mites

1247

1271
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,030
grow cannabis with sunshine you can

1272
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:40,279
often feel limited by the seasonal cycle

1273
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,170
you want to grow sustainably and save

1274
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,000
money so you use as little electricity

1275
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,740
as possible but if you haven't studied

1276
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,269
or implemented light deprivation

1277
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:49,369
techniques into your greenhouse you're

1278

solutions into your greenhouse you can

1281
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,180
often add two or three additional

1282
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,800
growing cycles to your year when you

1283
00:45:56,179 --> 00:45:59,690
pencil out the financial benefit of

1284
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,640
those additional cycles you'll realize

1285
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,590
why commercial scale light deprivation

1286
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:06,139
technology is remaking the cannabis

1287

industry what used to be done by pulling

1288
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:09,799
tarps over hoop houses has been scaled

1289
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,719
up over the last few years in such a way

1290
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,430
that it's become mechanized easy and

1291
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:16,250
affordable to even small-scale

Shango Louis and our guest this week is

1332
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,300
Erik Weber founder of dungeons vault

1333
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:39,219
genetics so you know up to this point

1334
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,180
we've talked a lot about how someone

1335
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:44,799
would start a seed company and and a lot

1336
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:46,359
of the you know the goods and the bads

1337
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,260
that you went through to get to where

1338
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:52,450
you are I want to focus this last set

1339
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,860
specifically on the gear that you put

1340
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:57,969
out because it's it's fabulous I've

1341
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:59,860
grown it myself I love you know actually

1342
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:01,179
I love everything I've grown and you

1343
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,269
know a lot of that I think has to do

1344
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:07,149
with the fact that you really rely a lot

1345
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:09,940
on this fabulous Grandpa's breath strain

1346
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:12,340
as what seems like your dominant male

1347
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:15,250
that you work with how did you find the

1348
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,510
grandpa's breath and and you know where

1349
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:22,599
did it where did your love affair with

1350
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:25,210
that plant start so when I was still

1351
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:27,009
working with granddaddy I had came to

1352
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:28,599
Kin because everything with that brand

1353
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,240
was obviously based on they've done the

1354
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:33,219
GDP grandpa's granddaddy grandpa

1355
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:34,929
anything like that it was all had to do

1356
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:37,059
with the the marketing for that company

1357
00:48:34,929 --> 00:48:38,980
so I originally told him hey there's

1358
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:41,289
this there's this clone going around

1359
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,030
it's very held back it's not passed to

1360
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:45,179
many people it's very exclusive and it

1361
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:48,790
was the og cush breath and we're talking

1362
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:50,529
we're talking back in like oh nine 2010

1363
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:52,900
no excuse me it was a little bit after

1364
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,360
that I'm wrong but either way it was it

1365
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,400
was it was anyway yeah it was early on

1366
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,740
in the in this in the stages of my

1367
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,010
breeding that that this og KB started

1368
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:02,229
getting

1369
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,540
passed around I have friends in

1370
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,760
California that looked after me and were

1371
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:08,559
very good to me and and I'm not gonna

1372
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,670
mention his name but he's a really good

1373
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,559
dude he's very well known in the

1374
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:14,079
cannabis industry and he he gave me

1375
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,820
clones because he knew I that you know I

1376
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,710
was good people I was gonna do anything

1377
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,960
bad with them and he trusted me with him

1378
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,599
so he gave it to me I used him I knew

1379
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,510
what I was doing and og KB to me was

1380
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:27,099
that was the best cookie it was it was

1381
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:29,140
such a good smell it was it was very

1382
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:31,539
rare and it was just one of those ones

1383
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:33,909
that if you had it you you you had

1384
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:38,590
something others didn't so I mean gage

1385
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:40,929
green myself and maybe one or two other

1386
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:42,519
people very few of us had that clone we

1387
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:45,369
were the first to bring any of these

1388
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,989
breath strains to the market I don't

1389
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:48,849
care what anyone says I could argue till

1390
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:51,039
night about you know his gage green with

1391
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:52,569
their mindo breath and the grateful

1392
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,639
breath and then I surely came after

1393
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:57,400
Sheree was out with the Grandpa's breath

1394
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,809
right after that and I knew from the

1395
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,360
start of the mail when I when I first

1396
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:03,759
crossed the og KB with the Tahoe GDP I

1397
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,820
knew immediately once I found this mail

1398
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,030
this thing was so just stout and it had

1399
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:11,380
I mean it made the last mails that I

1400
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,940
found when I was working for Andy looked

1401
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:17,039
like nothing I mean they just really I

1402
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:19,780
knew was gonna be good and then as I

1403
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,159
continued forth my project I saw what

1404
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,690
was coming out of it and everything that

1405
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:24,039
I saw tested and grown out was

1406
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:26,349
incredible so it was really just

1407
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:28,119
something special and that's really why

1408
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:30,130
it was used in everything because rather

1409
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:33,159
than using too many strains and having a

1410
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,970
bunch of stuff that I'm not certain is

1411
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:35,259
going to be great

1412
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:36,159
I found something special and I knew

1413
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,600
that's what I was going to base

1414
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,569
everything off of and so that's what I

1415
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,239
did the the grandpa's breath has got

1416
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:46,120
something for everybody too because you

1417
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:48,279
know people have asked me before like

1418
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,529
like I I really like the foul-mouth

1419
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,600
right and so so people asked me to

1420
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,460
describe the the Grandpa's breath and

1421
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:57,069
I'm all like well you know it's it's

1422
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:59,170
it's fuelie but it's got some floral in

1423
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:01,510
there but but it's got some of those

1424
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:04,210
like old-school alcohol esters like

1425
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:06,130
skunk does and so people are like so and

1426
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,480
essentially you know taste like and

1427
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,039
smells like everything I'm like well

1428
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,469
yeah I guess it kind of does you know

1429
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:14,039
it's it's it's not one of these strains

1430
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:17,309
that you're pigeon-holed into

1431
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:20,070
um one descriptor it's not one thing

1432
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:22,079
it's actually a lot of things and yeah

1433
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:24,000
one of the cool things about F ones is

1434
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,099
that you can put you you get to

1435
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,250
experience you get to treasure hunt fee

1436
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:33,509
knows still and and I enjoy that aspect

1437
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:35,429
of it ya know I mean it's it's from what

1438
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:38,190
I will say that I've noticed for sure

1439
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:41,849
with this mail no matter what it's

1440
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:43,829
touched you still get you still get

1441
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:47,130
dominance from the from the female half

1442
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:50,309
but that male brings so much frost and

1443
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:52,559
so much kind of like almost like an

1444
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:54,090
earthiness and berries is kind of what I

1445
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,489
would describe because everything in

1446
00:51:54,090 --> 00:52:00,480
there you there's always kind of a gray

1447
00:51:56,489 --> 00:52:01,889
P musky berry thing going on in some of

1448
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,840
the fee knows no matter which what you

1449
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:05,730
grow but there's always going to be the

1450
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,260
dominant you know a female phenotype

1451
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,699
that comes in but yeah like you said

1452
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,890
there's a little bit of something for

1453
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:12,480
everybody because people like the purple

1454
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:14,039
you get that the bag of pill is there

1455
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,789
with every strain doesn't matter what

1456
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:19,409
you choose and then the some people

1457
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:20,969
there what's your biggest yield er

1458
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:23,369
there's quite a few that actually yield

1459
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:25,439
quite well and surprisingly because of

1460
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:27,150
having the Girl Scout and then the OG

1461
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,349
and GDP you don't think those three

1462
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:29,460
strains together are gonna create

1463
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:31,529
something that yields heavy but

1464
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,769
surprisingly enough it does and it's

1465
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,810
it's many growers who have tried my

1466
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:38,909
strains out have reported back above

1467
00:52:36,809 --> 00:52:40,259
average yields even so once these once

1468
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:41,489
these strains get dialed in and you know

1469
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,950
what you're doing with them I mean they

1470
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:46,019
can really be rewarding in so many

1471
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:48,359
levels yeah it's probably a lot of fun

1472
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:50,639
too for when you know once your seeds

1473
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,130
started hitting the street and people

1474
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,719
who you did not know personally so so

1475
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:57,240
obviously your your friends and your

1476
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:59,669
inner circle we're growing your gear but

1477
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:01,949
when people start to report back beyond

1478
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:04,230
your sphere of influence that they're

1479
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:06,179
growing your stuff and really liking it

1480
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:08,880
there's got to be a lot of self

1481
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:11,879
satisfaction in knowing that other

1482
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,960
people are digging on on your on your

1483
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,890
baby you know

1484
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,659
oh absolutely like my my first years in

1485
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:20,129
with kin and all that stuff I was seeing

1486
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:21,569
people bringing these samples to the

1487
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,369
shows and hey this is your purple

1488
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:25,590
champagne hey this is the this is the

1489
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:27,779
grand OG this is this this is that and I

1490
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:30,269
was super stoked I was I was I was half

1491
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,070
what I was seen I felt pretty cool you

1492
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:33,599
know it'll Pat on my own back you know

1493
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,490
like I made that that's that's that's

1494
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,869
really cool you know I was my it was a

1495
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:38,579
dream and now it's come true

1496
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:41,789
but what I've noticed now with this

1497
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:44,579
grandpa's breath line it doesn't matter

1498
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:46,409
what you bring by I am so impressed with

1499
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:47,069
every single sample that gets brought to

1500
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:49,799
my table

1501
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:51,480
and I'm always so happy and so excited

1502
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,570
to see the next one that someone has

1503
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,429
because it's always been it's it's very

1504
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:58,260
rewarding feeling but not only that it's

1505
00:53:56,429 --> 00:54:00,239
it's just cool because this is what I've

1506
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,800
always want to do I've want to make

1507
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:03,509
strange that I would be happy to smoke

1508
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,010
and stuff that I mean to be sitting

1509
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:07,290
there smoking on a strain that I created

1510
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,880
and knowing that I'm not you know I'm

1511
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:10,230
not just smoking it because I Korea I'm

1512
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,940
smoking because I enjoy it and that's

1513
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,860
something I would actually recommend to

1514
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,079
other people to try not just not just

1515
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:19,019
create a sale but because hey this is

1516
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,539
good weed it's it's pretty good feeling

1517
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:22,800
I gotta admit yeah I love it and every

1518
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:24,480
single time I hear from someone that

1519
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,300
they enjoy my strains it's just another

1520
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,219
you know huge blessing because you know

1521
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,590
I know I'm doing something right one of

1522
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:35,309
the far-out things I think for being a

1523
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:39,170
breeder versus a big you know commercial

1524
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:42,449
production grower is that you're winning

1525
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:44,519
cups cannabis cups but like you're not

1526
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:46,439
winning them it's it's the people who

1527
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:48,690
have bought your gear who are then

1528
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,789
winning the cups and so you know your

1529
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:54,119
work is winning the cup put together

1530
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:56,039
with their work that must be a strange

1531
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,769
feeling but what was it like the first

1532
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:02,759
time that one of your strains won a cup

1533
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:05,190
that someone else grew that that was

1534
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,220
insane because it wasn't just one cup

1535
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:10,860
this guy he goes by the name big worm

1536
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:13,829
online he literally he makes incredible

1537
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:17,340
oil but he was over in Massachusetts as

1538
00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:21,000
where he's based out of but um he he got

1539
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:22,680
he placed at the secret cup for the east

1540
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,320
coat or fur I don't remember rozat but

1541
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:28,109
he placed a secret cup made it to the

1542
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,730
finals and then with my citrus farmer

1543
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:32,550
strain he literally swept the

1544
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:35,219
competition I mean he won in one night

1545
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,850
best overall highest Terps and best

1546
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:38,579
shatter

1547
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:40,650
I mean in one night and that was all

1548
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:41,759
first place awards for citrus farmer and

1549
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,130
then I got to smoke

1550
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,670
the oil shortly thereafter and it I mean

1551
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:51,329
absolutely burnt orange just absolute

1552
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:55,340
dank it was so good and I talked about

1553
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:57,690
feeling feeling really cool and having a

1554
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:59,010
moment that's that was it for me I was

1555
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,869
like that's that's awesome to know that

1556
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:02,370
people are are that impressed with the

1557
00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:05,039
strain and it's coming out that that

1558
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:07,559
good and people are really you know

1559
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:10,320
positive reviews it it makes me feel

1560
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,029
really good you know and in the end it

1561
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,100
is also a business so I'm assuming that

1562
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:16,530
once people started winning cups with

1563
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:18,029
your gear that that really helped at the

1564
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,980
box office to write because suddenly

1565
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:21,390
people are all like wow I hadn't heard

1566
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,980
of that strain they look it up and

1567
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:24,480
suddenly they're on your IG and now

1568
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,460
they're trying to totally connect with

1569
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,409
you at a at an event or something to buy

1570
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,789
the seeds that probably makes all the

1571
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:32,429
difference in the world when when your

1572
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:35,279
stuff starts winning awards oh yeah

1573
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:37,049
tangey tangi with Crockett and DNA those

1574
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,430
guys blew up with that strain I can't

1575
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:40,140
say for certain that that's the first

1576
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:41,609
orange train I've ever had orange

1577
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:45,559
strains have been around for years and

1578
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:47,820
years but they kind of they kind of

1579
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:50,519
really set the standard for orange

1580
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:52,820
trains right so when I was given my

1581
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:57,659
skunk tangerine cut from organ and kid

1582
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:59,940
that one is one that is so it's so held

1583
00:56:57,659 --> 00:57:02,069
back not very few people have that clone

1584
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:04,200
so the amount of breeders working with

1585
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,460
it is to me and archive seeds is the

1586
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:06,629
only people that I have it as far as I'm

1587
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,460
concerned I haven't seen anyone else

1588
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:12,630
using it no one else is working with it

1589
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:14,039
and it had such a strong smell it was

1590
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,150
incredible and I knew right then and

1591
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:17,969
there that that was going to be

1592
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:19,740
something that as soon as people saw it

1593
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:21,269
and smelt it and got to see what they're

1594
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:23,059
gonna get from my seeds they were gonna

1595
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:27,000
it was gonna be popular we released

1596
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:31,170
citrus farmer at the Emerald cup in 2015

1597
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,929
I believe and it sold out that weekend

1598
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:38,190
so then it was not even let's see that

1599
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:40,649
was December 2015 so I think yeah later

1600
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:42,630
on in the year 2016 was when when citrus

1601
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:45,059
farmer really blew up at one for war so

1602
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:46,829
it won those three at secret cup for the

1603
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:50,159
shatter and then the week after that it

1604
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:51,929
won at a another event over in Maine or

1605
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,269
on the East Coast for the flower at one

1606
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:55,529
third place overall so it really started

1607
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:58,079
making waves and even to the

1608
00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:00,180
des everyone that grows it has has left

1609
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,590
back left me such positive feedback and

1610
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:04,469
has really enjoyed it it's been very

1611
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:07,710
well reviewed I know that like trying to

1612
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:09,480
choose your your favorite strain is like

1613
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:11,250
trying to you know choose a favorite

1614
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,789
child or something but is there the art

1615
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:17,250
is there a particular strain in in your

1616
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:19,199
line that you feel especially warm to

1617
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,760
like that like you know maybe it's maybe

1618
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:22,500
it's the first cup or maybe it's

1619
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,490
something that that you know was

1620
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,929
especially difficult for you to run that

1621
00:58:25,489 --> 00:58:29,039
man it's such it's like you said it's

1622
00:58:27,929 --> 00:58:30,299
like trying to choose your favorite

1623
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,559
child how do you say that you make sure

1624
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,510
they're not looking when you say it but

1625
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:36,179
I mean really it's it it's since they

1626
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,800
can't hear me I would say that if I had

1627
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,929
to choose overall if I'm left on an

1628
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,180
island with one strand of smoke that's

1629
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:45,419
so hard but I would say hot rod oh right

1630
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:47,460
on yeah I mean my that or the ones that

1631
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:51,840
are sold out my Swamp Thing or lost soul

1632
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:53,280
anything oh gee Kim sour flavor anything

1633
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,900
that's you cracked that jar and you can

1634
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,300
smell it across the room that's that's

1635
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,490
what I'm after so we have found so much

1636
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,920
gas out of the hot rod that that really

1637
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:04,319
was that that to me is probably my go-to

1638
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,539
favorite but the Grandpa's breath man

1639
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,950
very they're like right there I've been

1640
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:11,400
smoking on grandmas but at the past two

1641
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:12,779
days and I love that strain it works out

1642
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,860
so well for me for sleep and for

1643
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:18,090
everything it's just a very heavy

1644
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:20,430
narcotic hi and I really enjoy it so but

1645
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:22,050
hot rod just because the the taste the

1646
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:23,669
Terps the smell overall everything about

1647
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:25,500
it it's just it's really what I'm after

1648
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:28,440
when I when it comes to what I choose

1649
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:31,769

1690
01:00:59,998 --> 01:01:04,558
people you know what I ended up doing

1691
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:07,950
was I told people the how limited they

1692
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,809

1693
01:01:07,949 --> 01:01:12,088
many packs available and I and I what I

1694
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:14,339
did was I actually opened it up to to

1695
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:16,978
some people before the show so I made it

1696
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:18,358
even more exclusive by offering people

1697
01:01:16,978 --> 01:01:19,308
if you can pay now and you want to pre

1698
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:21,598

1699
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:23,460
go right ahead you know send me the

1700

01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,739

01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,640
many messages and so many people

1703

1704
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:34,139

1706
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:38,009

1714
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,829
absolutely incredible and we took video

1715
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:54,269
because I've never been that busy ever

1716
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:55,710
at any show where I had that many people

1717
01:01:54,268 --> 01:02:00,748
waiting in line like I'm dropping the

1718
01:01:55,710 --> 01:02:02,670
next iPhone or something so so those

1719
01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:04,288
seeds that were all your limited

1720
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:05,849
editions are do you think that you're

1721
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:07,739
gonna move forward with all of those or

1722
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:10,499
were those just you know fun things that

1723
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:12,059
you figured on the side and you know you

1724
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:13,348
just you just wanted to get them out but

1725
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:15,930
you're not gonna move down the road with

1726
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:17,640
them a lot of peace fine I mentioned

1727
01:02:15,929 --> 01:02:19,739
archive really he made a joke one time

1728
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:21,629
we made a meme about it there was you

1729
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:22,829
know it was like the breeders list you

1730
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,260
know like what what that what that

1731
01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:25,210
really

1732
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:28,030
some people say limited-edition means

1733
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:29,949
totally untested you know high-priced

1734
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:31,180
you know BS just some what's up breeder

1735
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:33,129
wants to put something out real quick

1736
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:36,339
that wasn't the case here what happened

1737
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:37,480
was I had a run where I fully intended

1738
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:40,720
on there being a hell of a lot more

1739
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:42,460
seeds in there word that the the mail

1740
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:45,039
just didn't put out as much pollen as I

1741
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:47,010
was hoping it would have and overall I

1742
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,239
think what what really happened was I

1743
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,650
calculated my run days I'm telling

1744
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:52,389
myself right here but let's just keep it

1745
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:55,960
real with everybody I

1746
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:58,089
I pulled I think a week early and so

1747
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,650
some of the seeds weren't even as fully

1748
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:01,180
developed as they should have been so I

1749
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,559
was like oh [ __ ] so when it's all said

1750
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:04,599
and done and I counted stuff there was

1751
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,980
some where it was like I want this

1752
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:08,079
strain release because this is too good

1753
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,460
not to release it and after testing it

1754
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,559
we knew that we had some killer stuff

1755
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,760
but there was not as much numbers as I

1756
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:14,380
normally would have so I was like you

1757
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,760
know what I'm gonna put them up there

1758
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,039
people that want them it's gonna be a

1759
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,750
limited edition get them while they're

1760
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:21,250
hot you know it's it's up to you if you

1761
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:23,710
want them great if not no big deal and

1762
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:25,989
sure enough I mean I they were very well

1763
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:27,849
accepted and everybody was super stoked

1764
01:03:25,989 --> 01:03:31,269
to get in line and get some of them so I

1765
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:33,309
would say that I would like all of them

1766
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:35,170
to be something in my line that comes

1767
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:37,449
back but at this point what I'm starting

1768
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:38,710
to realize is and I don't think a lot of

1769
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:44,319
people realize this either is I'm

1770
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:46,510
working very exclusively you know on

1771
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,990
certain things it's very it's it's I'm

1772
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:52,240
doing things alone I don't have I don't

1773
01:03:49,989 --> 01:03:54,579
have a huge team I'm working with I'm

1774
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:56,369
not I don't have a gigantic facility I'm

1775
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:58,239
breathing out of so I don't have

1776
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:59,980
unlimited numbers when it comes to these

1777
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:01,869
things I don't have I don't have a

1778
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:03,760
hundred different rooms to make all

1779
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:07,599
these different strains so what it comes

1780
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:10,030
down to is I do more or less kind of

1781
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,440
boutique runs and boutique drops and and

1782
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:13,030
now that's how it's gonna be like if you

1783
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,409
if you're in if you're in that line you

1784
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:16,090
get a hold of them then great because

1785
01:04:14,409 --> 01:04:18,250
that I really mean it they're limited as

1786
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:20,500
in I might it might be another year or

1787
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:22,989
two before I remake them so it's one of

1788
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:24,400
those things like I've got so many great

1789
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:26,829
ones that I've now released and have

1790
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,269
become popular off of but now you know I

1791
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,799
mean people are asking for certain ones

1792
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:31,090
to come back and I've got so many other

1793
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,430
ones I need to do and then trying to

1794
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:35,050
stay relevant and make new strains it's

1795
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:36,589
it's overwhelming at times and that's

1796
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:38,120
another thing you asked about

1797
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:40,579
people wanted to get into this industry

1798
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:41,869
and how easy is it it's hard and you're

1799
01:04:40,579 --> 01:04:43,460
dead you're dedicating your life to

1800
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:44,659
making seeds and then you got to test

1801
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:46,460
those seeds and you got to grow those

1802
01:04:44,659 --> 01:04:47,719
seeds and you talk about six months down

1803
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:49,730
the line before you can even do anything

1804
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:51,619
with them well in those six months I've

1805
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,780
got zero Gardens I'm cropping out either

1806
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:55,849
so I'm not growing anything for smoking

1807
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:58,400
it's literally just making seeds and

1808
01:04:55,849 --> 01:05:00,619
there's it's so it's it's how it's it's

1809
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,930
very difficult at times to do everything

1810
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:04,670
and have it all you know make sure you

1811
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:06,710
got everything that people want and and

1812
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:08,809
you know taking care of everything you

1813
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:10,550
need to do it's it's it's tough

1814
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:12,320
it probably frees you up to a certain

1815
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:14,780
degree to that you're not having to

1816
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,580
bring in product you know heavy

1817
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,140
commercial production level of flowers

1818
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:21,590
to you right because you know growing

1819
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:24,379
flowers full-time is is a is an arduous

1820
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:26,900
thing and you know you you specialize on

1821
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:28,480
doing seeds you know like a ninja and I

1822
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:31,130
and I find that across our industry

1823
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,599
people who are specializing I mean you

1824
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:34,550
know we all need to know something about

1825
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:37,579
everything right because always hearts

1826
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:39,050
fit in together right but but I think

1827
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:41,929
that the people who are allowed to

1828
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:44,300
really study their particular discipline

1829
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:46,339
and they do it better than anybody they

1830
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,410
reap the rewards because most everybody

1831
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:50,780
else is just kind of like a dilettante

1832
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:53,000
yeah no I totally agree and one thing

1833
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,590
I'll say not not to I'm not trying to

1834
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,280
toot my own horn here anything but I

1835
01:05:54,590 --> 01:06:00,740
have focused on trying to make strains

1836
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,540
that I knew were gonna be great I

1837
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:05,689
originally released I believe twelve

1838
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:07,369
twelve strains or so or in my line from

1839
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:11,240
the time I told you I left granddaddy on

1840
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:12,920
at that first Emerald cup 2014 no excuse

1841
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:15,909
me to I'm fifteen was when I first had

1842
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:19,190
all my line fully released for everybody

1843
01:06:15,909 --> 01:06:21,379
there there was up at one point I told

1844
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:23,599
people I said I'm not making any more

1845
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,599
seeds I'm gonna I'm gonna let this line

1846
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,549
ride for a while till I see everybody

1847
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:30,139
has grown them I don't want to be a guy

1848
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,430
that's got you know what someone comes

1849
01:06:30,139 --> 01:06:33,379
up to me what strain do you recommend

1850
01:06:31,429 --> 01:06:35,000
well I've got fifty you know here let me

1851
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:36,800
totally try and pick one out for you

1852
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,329
know let's have you grown any of my

1853
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,590
stuff well I've got 12 to choose from

1854
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:40,909
let's how do you do this one then come

1855
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:43,550
back in two months let's try another one

1856
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:45,559
like I really encourage people to let me

1857
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:47,450
help you find something from my line

1858
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:49,849
that I think you'd like and also just

1859
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:50,389
just give it a try if you if you trust

1860
01:06:49,849 --> 01:06:52,338
in my

1861
01:06:50,389 --> 01:06:53,960
and you like what you tried before then

1862
01:06:52,338 --> 01:06:55,940
you will love all the other ones as well

1863
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,130
so it's one of those things I really

1864
01:06:55,940 --> 01:07:00,409
want to be more of a more of an

1865
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:02,630
exclusive breeder to where I don't have

1866
01:07:00,409 --> 01:07:05,690
150 strains in a few years I've been out

1867
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:07,369
I've got my original line and I've just

1868
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:09,380
now broken off into making a few more

1869
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:11,750
and I've got more that are in testing

1870
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:14,660
now but I've I'm not quick to jump to

1871
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:16,880
market with you no more than I can chew

1872
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:19,250
I want to be able to say that I've grown

1873
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,568
and I've seen things grown and can give

1874
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,949
you some solid feedback on everything

1875
01:07:20,568 --> 01:07:23,808

1876
01:07:21,949 --> 01:07:25,969

1880
01:07:30,048 --> 01:07:35,389
anybody would come on a show and talk

1881
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,730
about you know how to build a business

1882
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:39,379
because you know in a certain way you're

1883
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:41,210
given out some of your special sauce

1884
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,619
secrets for how you build dungeons vault

1885
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:44,630
and you know that there's people out

1886
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:47,450
there that you're inspiring during this

1887
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:49,789
show who are now going to make seeds and

1888
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:52,669
are therefore you know seeing themselves

1889
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:56,210
as competitors but but you are so

1890
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:58,490
comfortable in you know who you are and

1891
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:00,470
your business that you were open to you

1892
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:02,868
know to talk shop with me other than

1893
01:08:00,469 --> 01:08:04,788
just you know your own strain so I

1894
01:08:02,869 --> 01:08:06,890
appreciate you both taking your time and

1895
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:08,480
and and talking about how you did it so

1896
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:10,608
that the next generation can come up

1897
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,380
behind you hey you know what thank you

1898
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:14,808
very much for having me I really enjoyed

1899
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,460
myself and to anybody out there looking

1900
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:19,190
to get in the industry and/or do their

1901
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:21,319
own seed breeding I encourage it just

1902
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:22,729
know there that it's it's it like I said

1903
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:25,310
it's a cutthroat business but that

1904
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:27,318
doesn't mean you know don't try I say do

1905
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,880
what you love and I love what I do and I

1906
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:30,770
wouldn't have it any other way so if

1907
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,880
anyone tells you not to do it just don't

1908
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:33,469
talk to them anymore because they're

1909
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,239
obviously not looking out for you so do

1910
01:08:33,469 --> 01:08:37,730
your thing and enjoy life and just do

1911
