2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,410
making cannabis products for yourself or

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,269
your arthritic grandmother is one thing

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,609
but making cannabis products for the

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,410
public is a whole different world not

6
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,210
only are you way more likely to get sued

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,070
if you make a mistake but selling

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,449
cannabis products commercially means

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,789
that you need to adhere to a wide range

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,039
of standards these standards are

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,260
generally manifested in a hodgepodge way

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,210
through state experimentation product

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,289
failures and everyone's fear of

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,239
violating the Cole memo

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,070
none of those methods will necessarily

16
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,988
derive scientifically accurate

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,738
manufacturing standards for cannabis

18
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:42,599
products though it's a mess if you enjoy

19
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,128
hearing frank discussions that dive deep

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,660

expert welcome to show Jhon thank you

63
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,840
I'm happy to be here so you know in the

64
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,479
early days of medical care

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,519
in Colorado and Washington in Oregon and

66
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,128
California there were pretty much zero

67
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,709
production standards and and few best

68
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:25,870
practices everything was being made in

69
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,640
you know kitchens and spare rooms in

70
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,739
people's homes and and most of it was

71
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:31,869
made with care but still most of the

72
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,269
products were not potency tested and I

73
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,549
even toured one production facility that

74
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,950
that had a chicken as a pet indoors

75
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,920
which was crazy and and part of the push

76
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:43,959
for more full legalization was because

77
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,839
everyone wanted to increase quality

78
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,390
standards and make products more uniform

79
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,310
you know what do you see as the early

80
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:54,909
motivators for cannabis folks to

81
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:58,180
standardize and improve quality there

82
00:02:54,909 --> 00:03:01,750
were a number of things that were

83
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:05,739
putting pressure on cannabis providers

84
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:08,199
at the time you know one was doctor's

85
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,420
confidence in the products you know and

86
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,128
when we first saw California and other

87
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:15,280
states come online with our medical

88
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:17,879
programs between 1996 and then starting

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,299
in 2002 when Americans for safe access

90
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,509
first helped create the distribution and

91
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:27,430
access centers in Oakland California

92
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:30,068
bypassing those early regulations you're

93
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:33,069
right there was no there was no required

94
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:35,949
testing and things like that but it

95
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:38,108
became quickly evident that physicians

96
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:41,018
which there were only a handful at the

97
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,129
time writing recommendations weren't

98
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:44,109
really that comfortable with

99
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:47,609
recommending a product that they did

100
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:50,590
have an unknown consistency or safety

101
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,930
and an unclear about what education

102
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,950
their patients were receiving before

103
00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:01,180
consuming these products and at the time

104
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:05,798
while physicians were recommending this

105
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,750
and in a very small number of them they

106
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,590
were also concerned about their own

107
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,750
education and so we kind of approached

108
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,108
it from that way the second thing that

109
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,238
happened was the de A's denial of a

110
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:21,339
rescheduling hearing happened around the

111
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:25,029
turn of the century one of the several

112
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:27,699
at this point and we read that as a road

113
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:30,399
map most people probably didn't read

114
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:33,189
full few hundred page reports but I've

115
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,109
read all of them and you know what they

116
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,990
said is there's these seven factors

117
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,759
there's these eight factors that

118
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,710
cannabis has to fulfill to be

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
rescheduled and one of them was there

120
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:47,549
are no standards of production

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,500
distribution safety there aren't studies

122
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,889
or you know ons a lot of the products

123
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,199
that people are accessing there is an

124
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,419
education or training and things like

125
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,699
this we're like oh well why don't we

126
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,850
address those things Thank You DEA for

127
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:06,300
telling us what we need to do and so

128
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,970
steps here the executive director of ASA

129
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,170
engaged in this really amazing campaign

130
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,170
more than ten years ago

131
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,480
to bring in standards groups and these

132
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,400
were years long conversation with the

133
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,640
American welfare McAfee and the American

134
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,769
Herbal Products Association and we began

135
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,500
working on the American herbal

136
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:28,599
pharmacopoeia cannabis monograph and at

137
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,759
the time there were no standards and so

138
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,270
we created this monograph with people

139
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,829
like Ethan Russo and Momma del Sol e

140
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:38,049
Rafael McCullum was a reviewer of the

141
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:39,699
document as well and many many other

142
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,199
people I think about thirty people in

143
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:46,000
total reviewed the monograph that myself

144
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,550
and several of the people drafted and

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,860
that readily got adopted across the

146
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,259
states you know there's so there's so

147
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,449
much catch-22 in that right the DEA is

148
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:57,039
all like you know we don't want to take

149
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,620
it off schedule one which would allow

150
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,640
people to use it for research until that

151
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,889
there are standards and the standards

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,689
they'd have to come from research so

153
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:06,669
you're you're put in this position where

154
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,670
you need to start really small and kind

155
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,170
of back into it yeah and the great thing

156
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,160
is is that the University of Mississippi

157
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:17,319
has been producing cannabis for decades

158
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,570
that people with compromised immune

159
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,969
systems have been using without ever

160
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,159
having a recall of their product you

161
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,950
know there are occasional adverse events

162
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,350
report and I'll say what you want about

163
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:31,029
the specifications of the products not

164
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,270
everyone's a big fan of there being

165
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:37,889
stems and seeds and pulverized material

166
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:40,959
but it's still met standards for use in

167
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,649
vulnerable populations and we've seen

168
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,930
decades

169
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:46,149
some people to this day through the old

170
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,709
federal IND program are receiving 300

171
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:50,379
pre-world cannabis cigarettes a month

172
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:52,538
and you know Irv Rosenfeld who's one of

173
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,490
them has never you know his doctor has

174
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,319
not as yet to report you know him

175
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,840
getting lung infections or having any

176
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,779
serious illnesses so in some sense we

177
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:05,079
know that the the cultivation of

178
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:07,448
production can be standardized and

179
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,300
what's standardized really means is that

180
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,460
the variability is known now you have

181
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,970
arranged a target you're trying to hit

182
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:17,948
and if you don't know what your range or

183
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,070
your variability is in your product you

184
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,750
probably don't know what you're doing if

185
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,019
you don't have product specifications

186
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,060
how do you know that's your product and

187
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,740
simple things like that can really make

188
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,629
a huge difference in the confidence that

189
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,220
physicians might have and patients might

190
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,589
have because you don't just have to win

191
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,580
over the patients they're grasping at

192
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:41,888
whatever is available to treat their

193
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:43,930
symptoms to to improve their conditions

194
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:47,590
but their caregivers are often the ones

195
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,990
who are accessing those products

196
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:52,418
administering those products and in

197
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,610
making critical thinking decisions about

198
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,379
whether or not that product is safe and

199
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,919
appropriate for their loved ones and so

200
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:02,259
by increasing confidence in these

201
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,779
products is by adhering to voluntary

202
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:07,930
consensus standards now every industry

203
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,908
has pretty much created its own

204
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,220
standards the people who are involved

205
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:14,800
the stakeholders the interested parties

206
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,210
get together and create standards and

207
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,550
that's what we did with the American

208
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:21,370
Herbal Products Association which is a

209
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,079
really amazing organization our

210
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,970
standards are also public and so we

211
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,800
mentioned the monograph which creates if

212
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,539
you want to call this a botanical

213
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,370
medicine or herbal supplement or

214
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:32,559
something like that follow these

215
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,709
standards to meet you meet these

216
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,079
specifications meet these guidelines and

217
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:40,329
you're you're making a product that fits

218
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,370
that definition likewise you also have

219
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,920
the operations your operations need

220
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,659
trained staff they need to be clean it's

221
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:51,309
Americans for safe access right so

222
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:52,958
making sure that you're ensuring that

223
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,458
for patients is really important and so

224
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,629
with the American herbal products

225
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,059
Association

226
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:00,659
we decided to form these committees with

227
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:03,609
them for cultivation manufacturing

228
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:06,338
laboratory tents testing and dispensing

229
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,930
and over eight years with involvement of

230
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,370
over a hundred cannabis companies we

231
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:11,500
created standards and when these were

232
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,720
published they were readily adopted by

233
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,669
over 20 states and for the first time we

234
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,800
saw recall plans adverse events

235
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:20,948
reporting lab testing and mandatory

236
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:23,349
employee training and and this has also

237
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:25,719
been a I think a game changer for a lot

238
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,360
of folks so let's let's talk for a

239
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,680
moment about the the the people involved

240
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,560
with making the standards obviously

241
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,318
Americans for safe access was was

242
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,549
driving this pursuit but you were

243
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:37,990
talking about lots of different people

244
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:40,208
coming in from different parts of the

245
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,940
industry to create this voluntary

246
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:45,008
consensus standard and you know when

247
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,529
there are so many different players with

248
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:50,139
a wide variety of approaches and

249
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:52,809
opinions how does a nascent

250
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:54,730
industry like ours derive a set of

251
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:56,439
standards that somehow incorporates the

252
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,360
body of knowledge of all the people

253
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,920
involved I mean you you get together a

254
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,470
bunch of cannabis people and there's

255
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:06,519
usually as many opinions as there are

256
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,980
people in the room so you know without

257
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,589
going too much into the methodology well

258
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,850
how did you find that the that the group

259
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:18,850
opinion somehow melded together to come

260
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,949
up with a singular best practice that

261
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,430
that's a great question and I think

262
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:26,318
first I'd like to illustrate it with

263
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:28,778
what the herbal products and botanical

264
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:30,698
medicine industry has done in the US and

265
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:33,370
how they have come together because even

266
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:35,620
within existing botanical medicines and

267
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,089
herbal supplements they're not all those

268
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:42,429
companies adhere to the same standards

269
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:44,230
some are some are less robust and the

270
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,729
health and safety practices they take

271
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,970
than others you know they're I think

272
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,209
there was a recent expose for example at

273
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,199
a major shopping outlet like a Target or

274
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,028
something like that

275
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:57,250
the herbal supplements had very little

276
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:59,019
to no active ingredients you know we see

277
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,448
the same thing with some of these CBD

278
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:05,198
products that people are selling on the

279
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:07,328
internet that they have 0.00% CBD in

280
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,509
them sometimes and this is something

281
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:12,139
that a lot of independent groups

282
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:14,120
looked at and so what I'd like to use as

283
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:17,929
an example of how the industry can get

284
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:23,029
galvanized is oftentimes for survival

285
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:25,759
and in the 1990s when appa really became

286
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,289
a prominent player the the standards

287
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,429
holding group for the patient-focused

288
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:35,839
certification program you know Larry

289
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:38,239
Kessler the then head of the FDA made an

290
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,129
announcement without a strategic plan

291
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,879
for it that he was going to make all

292
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:46,009
vitamins of illegal and supplements that

293
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:48,830
didn't have a letter or number in their

294
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:50,779
name so like vitamin E would be okay b12

295
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,990
would be okay but say goodbye to your

296
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:56,480
ginkgo biloba extract or potentially

297
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,870
essential oils things like that and as

298
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,360
you can imagine this galvanized an

299
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,720
industry in a way that had never been

300
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,700
seen before and so the FDA through a

301
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:14,810
decades-long process of gaining power

302
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:17,060
made a huge power play here and what

303
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,699
ended up happening was is that the

304
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,979
Herbal Products Manufacturers and

305
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,200
Industry they launched the most

306
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,750
successful grassroots campaign in the

307
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,140
history of the United States all health

308
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,799
food stores across the country stores

309
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:37,519
that sold herbal supplements vitamins

310
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:39,799
botanical medicines put caution tape and

311
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,659
tarps and things over the supplements

312
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,969
those sections and said you know if you

313
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:46,939
want to have this is what the FDA wants

314
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:50,570
to do is take away your ability to

315
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,010
choose your medicines to choose your

316
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:57,350
durable supplements and things like that

317
00:12:52,009 --> 00:13:00,860
and in between 1993 to 1994 Congress

318
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,560
received more letters about the right to

319
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,720
choose your own botanical medicines and

320
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:10,369
herbal supplements than any other issue

321
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,000
the piece the federal deficit war you

322
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,570
name it

323
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,389
that was issue and the FDA called Appa

324
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,980
and said we give up let's write a bill

325
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:21,379
and they wrote the dietary health and

326
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,600
supplement Education Act or de chelly

327
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:26,269
now this created standards for labeling

328
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,060
of herbal products shortly thereafter

329
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:32,299
there was also the Good Manufacturing

330
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:34,399
Practices laws that passed as well and

331
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:37,370
this gave the industry a group of

332
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,850
standards and not still to this day many

333
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,769
many there are many great players in the

334
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,060
botanical medicine and herbal products

335
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:45,949
base but there's also a lot of

336
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:47,959
characters who decide not to engage in

337
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,920
that or create their own standards

338
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,900
grouping or you know what have you but

339
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,479
the idea is it gives a path forward for

340
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:59,539
those people who are thinking ahead and

341
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,580
I think that for the cannabis world it

342
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,259
was well there are no standards my

343
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,350
regulations in my state haven't caught

344
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:08,750
up but I immediately you know a lot of

345
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,930
companies see the validity and value of

346
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,399
taking on national standards or

347
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,289
voluntary standards even if they're not

348
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,929
required in their state you know give

349
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:20,029
you an example you know medical cannabis

350
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:22,339
is not required to be tested in Colorado

351
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:26,839
but there are many companies that engage

352
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,730
in product safety testing for their for

353
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,590
their patients yeah becomes a market

354
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,289
differentiator they're able to use it in

355
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:36,410
marketing to say hey we we adhere to a

356
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:38,480
higher level of quality assurance yeah

357
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:41,240
and those are the places I think that

358
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,730
will stay open them you know one of my

359
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,430
mentors uh said to me you know you

360
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,480
you're like the world's luckiest

361
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:49,429
paleontologist and I said well what do

362
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,300
you mean and she said well you get to

363
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:55,039
walk with the dinosaurs you know you in

364
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,809
ten twenty years no one's gonna believe

365
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,779
you that there were these huge big

366
00:14:56,809 --> 00:15:02,359
lumbering companies and much like the

367
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:05,779
dinosaurs the environment was very

368
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,639
different then than it is now and so I

369
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,829
think when we think about changes in

370
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:13,009
regulations you know what is gonna

371
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,930
survive these changes in development of

372
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:17,330
regulations I mean on the East Coast

373
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:19,779
what I'm seeing with my work there you

374
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,940
know changes gears a little bit is with

375
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:25,429
doing regulatory inspection trainings in

376
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,020
writing checklists for regulators and

377
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:30,079
working with our contracts we have with

378
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:32,210
the program administrators you know they

379
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,700
are getting very serious about

380
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,030
compliance not just with the Cannabis

381
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,870
ready

382
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:41,059
relations but workers safety issues too

383
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,679
and we were seeing you know cannabis

384
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,779
operations around the country getting

385
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,489
now getting inspected even though

386
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,529
they're federally illegal getting

387
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,049
expected by state agencies and even

388
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,809
though state agencies having nothing to

389
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,519
do with cannabis are issuing fines

390
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:58,459
especially for workers safety violations

391
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,470
and dangerous environments which could

392
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,320
simply be that you don't have a fire

393
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,389
evacuation map on the wall and little

394
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,280
things like that that you would expect

395
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:08,809
from any other employer you went to work

396
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,569
with now there are a lot of good players

397
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:13,909
out there and we cannot sit around and

398
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,740
highlight and point out the bad guys but

399
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:17,539
I think what we can do with standards

400
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,399
and third-party certification is easily

401
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:22,549
highlight the people who are doing

402
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,259
things right we're doing a good job and

403
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:26,209
I think that's the power of this like

404
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:29,149
you said it differentiates people and I

405
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,100
think the key to acceptance of cannabis

406
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:34,819
and getting over these walls that are

407
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,830
that are that are keep popping up it is

408
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,900
the standardization of products is

409
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:42,500
applying these standards is

410
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:44,720
appropriately testing your products you

411
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,750
know I sometimes think that someday

412
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,740
there's going to be a cultivator or

413
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,720
manufacturer that's going to get really

414
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,090
upset when someone brings them an

415
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,310
inflated THC reading from a lab and

416
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,649
they're paying for thousands of dollars

417
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:59,959
of milligrams of THC that simply aren't

418
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,850
there in the product and I think that as

419
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,970
things move forward and get more

420
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:08,000
regulated the accuracy of lab testing

421
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,579
the reliability of labs the reliability

422
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,619
of sample collection representative

423
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,929
sampling of products of standardization

424
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:17,269
of processes is not just going to become

425
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:20,450
an issue of quality it'll be a very

426
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:23,059
serious economic issue we're already

427
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,549
seeing that in extraction vessels which

428
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:29,960
again a lot of seen a lot of groups that

429
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:32,539
don't that can't predict their yields

430
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,430
from doing an extraction process you

431
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:37,430
know they just say oh I got a lot this

432
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,890
time well as far as I know a lot isn't

433
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:43,340
really a quantifiable number a lot

434
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,990
compared to what and so I think you know

435
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:46,149
people are always surprised and one of

436
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,410
the things that I've done in my own

437
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,950
independent research field as I look at

438
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,560
a lot of

439
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,769
Cannabis waste and there's so much

440
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:57,289
valuable stuff that simply isn't

441
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:59,329
extracted fully that is thrown away and

442
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,980
sometimes regulations do do interfere

443
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,359
with some of these processes like I'd

444
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,059
like to see more people looking at

445
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,709
cannabis routes but some states make you

446
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:09,879
throw that away

447
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:12,559
so I think there's a lot of

448
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,510
opportunities in innovation and

449
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,289
increasing efficiency and overall

450
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:20,119
product safety as well and again a lot

451
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:22,879
of this hinges on a couple of things is

452
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:26,299
access to those educational materials

453
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,700
you know we Americans for safe access

454
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:30,980
helped design a study on dispensary

455
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:34,370
staff training which was published in a

456
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:38,450
2016 in December by ryan van jury and

457
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:41,029
marcel von miller and what they showed

458
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,910
was that a lot of dispensary staff don't

459
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:46,339
have science or medicine you know

460
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:48,140
incorporated into their training and let

461
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:51,649
me illustrate something for you you know

462
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,300
to set the stage you know the thing that

463
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,670
I worry about you know is imagine if

464
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:58,099
this was for example I had you know so

465
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,950
aggressive cancer and I had to was new

466
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:03,109
to cannabis and I went into a dispensary

467
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,910
and I really have just three things to

468
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,449
guide my choice about a medicine for my

469
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,070
treatment

470
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:13,250
one is a strain or variety name another

471
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:16,039
one is a potency level right how much

472
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,509
THC or CBD is in the product and the

473
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,159
third thing is something that says you

474
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:21,650
know keep out of reach of children or do

475
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,410
not consume while driving that's really

476
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,300
you know all the information that you

477
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,720
might have when making a very important

478
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,099
decision so the quality of training of

479
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,410
the dispensary staff were the

480
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:35,119
ambassadors of these products right

481
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,440
they're not producing the products

482
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,789
they're not cultivating the products

483
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,559
mostly the dispensary staff has probably

484
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:42,799
never been inside a manufacturing

485
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,629
facility for cannabis and so it becomes

486
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,769
really important that they understand

487
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:51,560
from seed to production what is

488
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:55,579
important in these products and we found

489
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:57,379
that you know most something like thirty

490
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:59,899
to forty percent had no science and

491
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,809
medical background we had them over a

492
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,640
phone interview make recommendation

493
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:08,369
like okay you have a patient coming with

494
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,350
high anxiety what would you recommend in

495
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:11,159
this instance knowing that you know

496
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:14,369
you're not supposed to make

497
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,900
recommendations you know strictly like

498
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:18,719
you got to be careful about that but

499
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,250
this was again a survey and kind of

500
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,789
testing their knowledge about the

501
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,200
products and you know there were some

502
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,899
you know interesting findings and one

503
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,750
was that when we had the statements

504
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,700
anonymous from the dispensary agents

505
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,950
reviewed by physicians by a panel of

506
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,539
physicians and about half the

507
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,970
recommendations the physicians thought

508
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:41,190
would have exacerbated a patient's

509
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,710
symptoms instead of improved them and

510
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,380
that was concerning for example someone

511
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,960
comes in with saying their have appetite

512
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,370
wasting or anorexia or hiv/aids and they

513
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,009
need to improve their appetite and

514
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:55,229
someone recommends a CBD rich product

515
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:58,259
which does not stimulate cannabinoid

516
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,569
receptors so it will not make you hungry

517
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:04,769
and so that would not have improved

518
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:06,329
someone's symptoms you know in CBD can

519
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:08,369
also be alerting and so if someone's

520
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:10,500
looking for something that's gonna put

521
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:12,389
them help them sleep better it's

522
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,140
debatable whether or not something rich

523
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:18,210
and can have a diol alone would be the

524
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,110
best choice just to give you some

525
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,759
conceptual examples to work with sure I

526
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:26,939
actually run into that all the time with

527
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,798
with patients who are taking CBD for

528
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,370
pain and they want to take it at night

529
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:35,099
for the pain but but then it causes them

530
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:36,928
to you know to feel a little stimulated

531
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,269
and have a hard time going to sleep and

532
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:41,370
so you know we move we move their CBD to

533
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:43,980
the front part of the day and and give

534
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:47,239
them you know something with light THC

535
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:50,339
from dare I call it an indica you know

536
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,929
strain and and you know helps them with

537
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,789
their insomnia but hey we're a little

538
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:55,019
late for our first break so let's go

539
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,329
ahead and take our short break it's also

540
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:59,490
very funny to listen to the background I

541
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:02,250
know that you're in your at your place

542
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,200
in there in Brooklyn and it's a you can

543
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,150
really get a sense of place it sounds

544
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,069
like kids outside playing hopscotch or

545
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,330
whatever they're doing yeah I live in

546
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:11,730
Crown Heights

547
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:13,319
and there's actually a rabbi down the

548
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,929
road for me as a big family but he's

549
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:18,808
also one of the medical cannabis

550
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:20,100
physicians in New York right okay so

551
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:21,960
let's go ahead and take that short break

552
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:24,118
and be right back you're listening to

553
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,369
shaping fire and my guest today is Jhon

554
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:28,908
Marku a chief science officer at

555
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:30,990
Americans for safe access

556
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:32,700
we humans are attracted to plants

557
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,038
because they offer us relief and are a

558
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,840
whole lot of fun sometimes though the

559
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,970
best parts are buried inside the plant

560
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,368
and we need to use specialty extraction

561
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,350
technology when it comes to cannabis it

562
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:45,569
is extraordinarily important to extract

563
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:47,819
its precious oils without changing them

564
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:49,918
in the process we want to preserve the

565
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:51,808
properties of the cannabinoids terpenes

566
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,450
and other constituents that all work

567
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:56,700
together since 1994

568
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:59,249
Eden labs has been developing extraction

569
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,830
technology and processes to do just that

570
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:03,690
Eden labs was founded by a cannabis

571
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:05,970
loving engineer during the early days of

572
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,548
medical marijuana in California and the

573
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,528
expanded Eden team has been designing

574
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:12,470
and building industry-leading solutions

575
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:15,599
for cannabis extraction ever since

576
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:18,419
Eden labs flagship product is the newly

577
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,519
improved High Flow co2 extractor as

578
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,740
other extraction companies enter the

579
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,720
market it is the high flow from Eden

580
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,849
labs that everyone chases and tries to

581
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,528
compare themselves with not only that

582
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:31,109
but the improved automation software

583
00:23:28,528 --> 00:23:34,349
allows data to be collected stored and

584
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:37,589

working alone or in tandem with an

588
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:46,259
initial stream distilling step to

589
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:48,439
isolate monoterpenes before extracting

590
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,999
the rest of the botanical constituents

591
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,700
Eden offers you many options including

592

listening to shaping fire I'm your host

649
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,940
Shengo Lowe's and our guest this week is

650
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:05,529
Jhon Marku chief science officer at

651
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,930
Americans for safe access

652
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,789
so we talked during the first set about

653
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,100
some of the best practices that have

654
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:13,569
started to become industry standards and

655
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:16,089
where those standards are even coming

656
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:19,869
from and one of the things I think a lot

657
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:24,009
about is the contrast between processing

658
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:27,009
enough for the uniformity of the product

659
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:29,470
so it meets a standard versus the

660
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:31,089
importance of whole plant medicine and

661
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,430
and and by whole plant medicine of

662
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:36,369
course I mean preserving all the the

663
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:39,759
cannabis constituents as a whole group

664
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:40,889
in the final product so the patient can

665
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,109
take advantage of the

666
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:46,680
taraji effect for you know both human

667
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:49,799
healing and equality buzz - the more we

668
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,320
process the more we seem to break up the

669
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:55,319
plant into its discrete parts thus

670
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,490
moving away from whole plant and I'm

671
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,559
sure that you've had to give you this a

672
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:02,130
lot of thought in developing being

673
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,470
standard so so where do you kind of

674
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,050
think through this for yourself to find

675
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,569
a happy medium between repeatable

676
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:11,819
results of a product but also being

677
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:13,950
whole plants since that's where all the

678
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:18,710
really good cannabis studies are based

679
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:21,000
on yeah I mean um well so I've been

680
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,579
injecting cannabis into various

681
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,279
instruments and applying it to cells for

682
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:28,619
purl for a fair amount of time and I

683
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:31,170
quickly realized this issue just within

684
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:33,719
my own hands because you know I was

685
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,789
having to generate data and you know in

686
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,279
just a simple student level and present

687
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,259
it to other people and I was working

688
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,420
with an internship with Arno has

689
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:45,059
accomplished seems like a lifetime ago

690
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,100
where I had to like ride a bicycle and

691
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:49,169
pick up samples from a coffee shop as

692
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:51,029
part of a product safety study and

693
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,130
analyze those in the lab at the

694
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:55,440
University of Leiden in Holland and I

695
00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:00,420
quickly found out that Wow you know

696
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:04,140
ethanol versus other solvents like ether

697
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,970
or sodium hydroxide really could change

698
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,480
what you were looking at like you could

699
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:12,240
use solvents in a setup where you could

700
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,549
actually remove the acids from the

701
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,710
extraction or you could favor the

702
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:19,529
extraction of some other terpenes and

703
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,329
this is like something we're seeing now

704
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:23,490
I think is affecting testing is like

705
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:25,409
people are like oh the labs are getting

706
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,890
it wrong I'm like well sometimes it's

707
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:31,110
the user error there but also when we do

708
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,660
a targeted analysis like saying we just

709
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:36,689
want to look at cannabinoids and you

710
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,700
extract for those nothing comes out

711
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,490
entirely unscathed you're gonna have an

712
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,549
efficiency there and some research that

713
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,529
we've done over in the Czech Republic

714
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:49,919
comparing different very recently

715
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:51,539
comparing different solvents and

716
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,500
extraction processes to be found like

717
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:56,480
holy cow like oh wow if you use meth

718
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,119
all over ethanol you're gonna favor

719
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,920
certain terpenes and so what I think

720
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,679
people need to start thinking about is

721
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,900
what they're testing for and so you have

722
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,789
a targeted approach which is like I want

723
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,830
to test for THC and then you can have

724
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,680
non-targeted which is I just want to see

725
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:14,839
everything that's there before I begin

726
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,580
the targeted approach and you know when

727
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,139
we talk about losing compounds and

728
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:20,720
changing things it's absolutely possible

729
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,970
you could start with one set of powdered

730
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,640
flower like a standardized batch of

731
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,220
flower its uniform just say imagine a 50

732
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,250
gallon drum of powdered cannabis and

733
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,950
everyone takes a handful out for a

734
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,140
different extraction process e2 makes a

735
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,539
in oil you could end up with as many

736
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:41,060
oils as samples you took with different

737
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:43,099
specifications because someone uses a

738
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:44,720
different ratio of methanol and ether or

739
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:47,230
whatever it is that they're extracting

740
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,269
in methanol chloroform what have you

741
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,069
versus ethanol or co2 yeah you could end

742
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,139
up with different products and then you

743
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:55,759
think about the lab well what are they

744
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,320
using to prepare their sample for

745
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,660
analysis cuz the lab just doesn't take a

746
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:02,359
cookie and like oh this looks good I'm

747
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,310
gonna shove this into my 250,000 dollar

748
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:07,159
piece of equipment that's a great way to

749
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:09,679
like destroy a workhorse in your lab

750
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,529
like just clog it and shut down the

751
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,529
system call it a day so they have to

752
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:19,639
extract what they want to test out of

753
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:21,649
that and I think that you know as we

754
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,790
think about manufacturing we shouldn't

755
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:28,220
think so much about focusing on you know

756
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:30,680
accuracy is important but also what are

757
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:34,250
you making what are your specifications

758
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:36,470
you people are very efficiently using

759
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,200
co2 which i think is one of can be one

760
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,809
of the safest extraction methods but use

761
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,509
often times if you're not super savvy

762
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:46,519
and have 20 years of experience by by

763
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,319
terpenes and you have to kind of collect

764
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,420
those but when you add them back to the

765
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:54,109
product are you adding them back in the

766
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:57,050
same ratio that's in the plant and so my

767
00:30:54,109 --> 00:31:01,039
very first research poster was entitled

768
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:03,109
plant wisdom cannabidiol enhances the

769
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,460
anti-cancer effects of THC it was the

770
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,309
first thing I ever presented at a

771
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,509
research conference and I develop that

772
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:10,819
idea of

773
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:12,349
from talking with amazing people reading

774
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:15,918
other people's work but doing my own

775
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:18,019
analysis and I had at the time gotten

776
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,179
the permission I think enough time has

777
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:22,339
passed I can talk about this but at San

778
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:24,769
Francisco State University I got this

779
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:27,709
very special permission to do a very

780
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:29,149
short-term project studying cannabis

781
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:32,028
through the legal market that had

782
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:34,118
developed there I was a patient at the

783
00:31:32,028 --> 00:31:37,069
time which made things less complicated

784
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:39,019
but essentially it was you know I got

785
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:42,408
permission for this one-year project and

786
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:44,509
what I found in my own very small

787
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:46,489
sampling was when I use different

788
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:48,710
extraction methods I did see slightly

789
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:50,659
different ratios of compounds but when I

790
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,639
use the same extraction method against

791
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,409
different samples I saw there were

792
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:56,329
varying ratios of terpenes and

793
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:57,859
cannabinoids now I didn't quantify

794
00:31:56,329 --> 00:32:00,319
everything I was just doing a non

795
00:31:57,858 --> 00:32:02,648
targeted approach seeing well what is

796
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,648
the fingerprint look like and can we

797
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:08,089
repeatedly make these fingerprints and

798
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:10,308
after a while is like wow there is a

799
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:13,009
difference I mean even 10-15 years ago

800
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:15,558
you could find a mouse of CBD that were

801
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:17,569
1 to 5 percent in the cannabis material

802
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:20,210
being distributed in California but no

803
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:22,608
one was looking for it at the time and

804
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,808
so I brought that data to a lab where I

805
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:26,148
was working and said hey you know I have

806
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,519
this chromatography data that looks at

807
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:31,069
ratios maybe there's something here

808
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,970
maybe some of these ratios might be good

809
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:36,378
for treating you know a certain disease

810
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,489
what do we got they said well we have

811
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:39,858
these really aggressive brain cancer

812
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:43,069
cells and petri dishes that don't seem

813
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:44,868
to have anything that affects them why

814
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:46,278
don't we throw some cannabinoids in

815
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:48,648
there and see what happens and so rather

816
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:51,710
than start with the the data that we had

817
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:53,329
from analyzing samples we started with

818
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,429
math and we started well let's just add

819
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:57,918
THC and an increasing amount see what

820
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:58,669
happens let's add CBD let's at CBN let's

821
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,980
that CBG

822
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:02,749
and then we took amounts of those

823
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,429
compounds that really did nothing on the

824
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:07,009
cancer cells and started combining them

825
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:09,109
together and through mathematics and

826
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:11,720
what's called a bunch of other nerdy

827
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:13,038
statistical stuff I won't go into the

828
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,778
paper has already been published so if

829
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,730
you want to look that up but we found

830
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:18,648
basically that you know you could

831
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,450
enhance activity with combinations of

832
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:21,500
cannabinoids and one of the things that

833
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,559
came out of

834
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,859
was a four to one ratio of THC to CBD in

835
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,289
a petri dish to to inhibit brain cancer

836
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:31,699
cells and so you know if you say we

837
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:33,799
wanted to turn that into a product

838
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,840
saying wow that looks like something

839
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:38,419
that can effect a very particular type

840
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,609
of brain cancer a very particular

841
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,070
molecular pathways could be triggered

842
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:44,839
you know that might inform what type of

843
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:46,549
product you want from your specification

844
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:48,529
if the other cannabinoids are not

845
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:50,180
important and the other terpenoids are

846
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:52,250
not important then you're going to

847
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,920
extract and process for those purposes

848
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,569
and so I think you know like my

849
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,880
roundabout way of talking about that is

850
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:00,829
is you know there there can be what's in

851
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,930
the plant and there can be what you

852
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:05,179
determine scientifically might be needed

853
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,400
for a condition and those two things are

854
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,099
not diametrically opposed through proper

855
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,010
extraction through knowing what you want

856
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,929
to get in the end product you can then

857
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,060
choose an appropriate extraction method

858
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,550
right now I feel like it's a little bit

859
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:21,529
of like a ready fire aim approach like

860
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,710
let's put everything into the extractor

861
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:27,110
I have this you know it's you know some

862
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:31,519
sort of magical filter that separates

863
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:33,019
things out and so I think when we think

864
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:37,099
about manufacturing people should have

865
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:39,619
an idea in mind about what they're doing

866
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:43,579
and I think GW Pharmaceuticals is sort

867
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:45,949
of the great conceptual example is they

868
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:48,110
wanted a one-to-one ratio of THC to CBD

869
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,989
and their product as well as a high

870
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:54,169
level of certain terpenes that have

871
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:56,750
strong anti-anxiety properties and so

872
00:34:54,168 --> 00:35:00,319
they took their CBD rich material made a

873
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,300
hash oil extract took their THC rich

874
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,570
material made a hash oil extract and

875
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:08,390
then combine those and ratios and that

876
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:10,580
sort of thinking I think needs to start

877
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:14,299
creeping over into the cannabis industry

878
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:16,940
you know you people patients are taking

879
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,230
different strains and combining them to

880
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,960
explore their effects

881
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,570
I would encourage more operators to be

882
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,800
more open about what they're making and

883
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,230
what they're combining you know don't

884
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,420
just take all the refuse and throw it in

885
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,619
there keep track of where that extra

886
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,079
material is coming from well these are

887
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,079
two different strains and things like

888
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,779
that

889
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,840
I think it's interesting that excuse me

890
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,910
that you know you kind of approach the

891
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,070
question differ from the opposite

892
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:47,250
direction that I normally do and in a

893
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:49,559
lot of the whole plant evangelists that

894
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,050
I talk with where you know we we

895
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:54,150
generally look at it as that okay you

896
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:57,840
know either you know your best would be

897
00:35:54,150 --> 00:36:00,119
either smoking or eating the flower

898
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,650
itself there's there's perfect right and

899
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,199
then and then a step down from that

900
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,940
would be you know an ethanol soak which

901
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,069
gets you know a good amount of

902
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,230
everything that's there and then as you

903
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:13,890
go down you know you know through the

904
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:17,159
hydrocarbons and co2 you're getting less

905
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:20,460
and less of the whole plant nosov it and

906
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:23,909
and and i like your idea that too

907
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:27,480
instead of continually going back to the

908
00:36:23,909 --> 00:36:30,239
the plant or the flower as being the

909
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,510
goal and to have all the extraction

910
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,129
methods and processing methods have to

911
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,920
compare themselves to the whole plant

912
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,530
instead go the other direction and say

913
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,680
okay what is this that you what's the

914
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,720
end goal of the product is this a an

915
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,750
intense dab oil for an extreme pain

916
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:50,879
patient is this is this somebody who

917
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:54,150
needs to get you know just a little bit

918
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,860
of you know THC but a whole lot of THC a

919
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,690
because they're working with Lyme's

920
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,720
disease or rheumatoid arthritis or

921
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:03,900
something and I think that that approach

922
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:06,899
is actually far more forgiving for

923
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:10,139
designers than the way most of us go

924
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,780
about it and and I think that that opens

925
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:15,359
up some some new possibilities so so let

926
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,550
me take this one this one more step

927
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,980
further then so some product designers

928
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:22,800
break the cannabis plant into all of its

929
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,980
individual constituents and then rebloom

930
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,680
as they wish customly and in other folks

931
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,920
you use isolates of components and just

932
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:35,250
sell them as is like the the popularity

933
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,079
of CBD isolate right now but but some

934
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,719
use the full extract cannabis oil

935
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,179
there will be variability in the in the

936
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:44,309
components from run to run but they're

937
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:45,569
going to be true to the strain behind it

938
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:46,588
so my question for you is do you think

939
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:50,099
that there's a

940
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:52,440
for that variability that's necessary

941
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,999
when using whole plant extracts because

942
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,579
you know let's say that I let's say that

943
00:37:53,998 --> 00:37:58,919
I run ten plants of the same strain and

944
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:01,469
I make you know ethanol hash oil out of

945
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,469
it and their own syringes there's gonna

946
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:06,778
be some drift between syringe but they

947
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:08,759
really are the pure plant how do you

948
00:38:06,778 --> 00:38:11,159
like resolve that for yourself when

949
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:13,798
doing standards between staying true to

950
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,808
the plant versus having repeatable

951
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:19,728
results so that labeling on the package

952
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:22,589
is accurate well first of all we have

953
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:24,328
two things one companies have already

954
00:38:22,588 --> 00:38:26,038
created standardized products right with

955
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:29,548
whole plant flower bed jerk an

956
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:34,319
international fantastic example of what

957
00:38:29,548 --> 00:38:35,818
you can do with standardized cultivation

958
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:39,630
procedures and creating sort of a

959
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:41,699
standardized plant material so you can

960
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,559
make cannabis plant material that will

961
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:47,009
meet pharmaceutical standards there are

962
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:49,410
some eyebrow-raising things that they do

963
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:51,239
like gamma radiate the material which

964
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:53,308
you know some people don't have a

965
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,139
problem with some people do you know the

966
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:57,920
banana 8:00 this morning was probably

967
00:38:55,139 --> 00:39:00,960
gamma-irradiated from the grocery store

968
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,358
so so you know there are ability to do

969
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,739
it Connecticut is a state I like to use

970
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,509
too because they have to meet

971
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:08,099
pharmaceutical standards so when we talk

972
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:10,559
about this drift it's absolutely

973
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:13,619
possible but this drift that we talked

974
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:18,210
about happens with all natural products

975
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:21,690
no I don't like to often invoke talking

976
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:24,478
about the alcohol industry but it can be

977
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,969
illuminating and informative and we talk

978
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:28,768
about its most close you know hops --is

979
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:29,778
most closely related relative of the

980
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,919
cannabis plant

981
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:37,048
so breweries deal with this similar

982
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,298
issues too and there's a thing called

983
00:39:37,048 --> 00:39:43,048
heads hearts and tails when you make a

984
00:39:39,298 --> 00:39:44,219
batch huge batch of beer and you know

985
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,228
and that's one of the differences

986
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,358
between some types of beer and others

987
00:39:46,228 --> 00:39:51,088
you know I went to graduate school in

988
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:54,568
Pennsylvania it's a very rich and

989
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:57,929
vibrant beer community there of you know

990
00:39:54,568 --> 00:40:00,179
of Vicki's various breweries that people

991
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:02,039
travel from all over to visit

992
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:04,259
they deal with the same issue and but

993
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,759
they've done it so much they've put

994
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,460
science in there saying you know when we

995
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,130
are some stuff is coming out of the

996
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,019
vessel and we're bottling it we're

997
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,550
paying attention to those different

998
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:16,469
things because there's certain parts of

999
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,780
it you don't want where the sediment has

1000
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:20,789
settled or near the top where it might

1001
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,470
be different or then maybe it needs to

1002
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:25,019
be continuously mixed while you're

1003
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:26,368
allotting it and so there are lots of

1004
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:29,449
other products that have that are

1005
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:32,250
natural that we see around us every day

1006
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:34,618
and I hate to use you know company names

1007
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:36,690
but you know one of my favorite things

1008
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:38,309
to ask people is why is Budweiser the

1009
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,000
king of beers is it because it's

1010
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:44,160
delicious and refreshing

1011
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,960
well you know that's questionable but

1012
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,940
it's really because it's the same

1013
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,088
anywhere you open it you open it in

1014
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,220
Japan or Paris or you know in Tennessee

1015
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:55,799
it's going to be the same product within

1016
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:58,439
a certain level of acceptable variation

1017
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,089
and I think you know thinking about it

1018
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:05,010
in broader terms yeah if you are

1019
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:06,509
capsulated or packaging a batch there

1020
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,160
might be certain things you can do to

1021
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,740
reduce the standards but that's also why

1022
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:13,588
you keep track of batches and also know

1023
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:16,828
what part you might want to use I've

1024
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:20,578
seen you know extracts that have been

1025
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:24,119
sitting for years and in storage you

1026
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:26,579
know I used to work under a DEA license

1027
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,980
in the past and I did some really just

1028
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,660
super fun stuff collaborating with my

1029
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,849
food also the university Sippy used to

1030
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,828
characterize new cannabinoids so you

1031
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:39,150
would discover and things like that and

1032
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:40,710
visiting Ole Miss and you know you can

1033
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,389
see that even extracts that were

1034
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,039
homogenized after they've been sitting

1035
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:45,659
for a while they will start to separate

1036
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:47,548
and you will see this sort of head

1037
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:50,129
hearts and Tails sort of thing happen or

1038
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:53,190
even a biphasic thing where some of the

1039
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:57,230
you know fats and stuff go to the top

1040
00:41:53,190 --> 00:42:00,510
even just sitting on a shelf over time

1041
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,010
right on so as far as the drift you know

1042
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,809
with some of the cannabinoids it's more

1043
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:06,599
serious than others right if there's if

1044
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:08,490
there's a drift in CBG unless that's the

1045
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,500
part of the medicine that you need you

1046
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:13,009
know the CBG may or may not matter but

1047
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,199
with THC obviously it

1048
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,510
serious really fast and one of the most

1049
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,089
serious challenges that edibles makers

1050
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,250
have is to ensure that each piece has

1051
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,530
the same dosage for example eating the

1052
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:27,079
first of ten cookies in a package

1053
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:29,870
expecting it to be ten milligrams when

1054
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:31,159
it's actually 17 milligrams can be a big

1055
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:34,099
deal to many users

1056
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:36,349
so imagine ization is a real problem you

1057
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:39,380
know what best practices do you see the

1058
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:43,039
industry adopting so each edible of a

1059
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:46,010
particular package is reliably dosed

1060
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:50,150
I think that that comes down to

1061
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:53,210
developing a method for properly

1062
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:56,090
extracting the cannabinoids from your

1063
00:42:53,210 --> 00:43:00,440
edibles one thing that has always struck

1064
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:03,760
me is weird is that you know I visit a

1065
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:07,940
lot of cannabis labs and almost no

1066
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,070
manufacturer provides a blank of their

1067
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,349
product for the labs to calibrate to

1068
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,940
like they might provide them the soda or

1069
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:15,710
the cookie or the Lawson's

1070
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,950
but they don't provide them just that

1071
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:21,110
matrix like oh here is what we use so

1072
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:23,509
you can create a sample prep method and

1073
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,519
you and and so that's part of it too and

1074
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,920
that was an issue and we were doing at a

1075
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:32,000
small team and we were traveling between

1076
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,190
different labs with our equipment to to

1077
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,829
look at edibles and what we published

1078
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:39,289
and throughout into the the Internet's

1079
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:41,539
was a if you freeze these products and

1080
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:44,239
pulverize them you can create a powder

1081
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:47,480
of almost anything and then do a more

1082
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:49,639
efficient extraction but still you know

1083
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,429
we ran into the issue where companies

1084
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:54,409
could not supply a blank of their

1085
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:57,429
product so that we could spike it with

1086
00:43:54,409 --> 00:44:00,139
cannabinoids and make sure that we were

1087
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:02,719
validating that collection process so I

1088
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:04,730
think that there is one that's aspect of

1089
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:10,519
it which says that you know I think

1090
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:13,460
every every single cannabis manufacturer

1091
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:17,329
needs an in-house lab you can't label

1092
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:19,940
your own supply but it can be extremely

1093
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:22,219
helpful to check along the production

1094
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,170
line if you're doing things correctly so

1095
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:25,989
as you go from Step a to step B to step

1096
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,610
C to set D your two

1097
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:29,439
measurements of one type or another

1098
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,660
maybe there are gal elliptic maybe it's

1099
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,599
the smell and feel thing maybe it's a

1100
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:36,250
decarboxylation step and then for the

1101
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:41,019
final testing you send it out to the lab

1102
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:43,179
that is what's now you know versus the

1103
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:44,409
old reactionary method which is we're

1104
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:46,389
going to make something and get a

1105
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:48,730
pass/fail at the end which leads to a

1106
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:51,639
lot of waste a lot of questions about

1107
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,740
standardization and then you know thin

1108
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:57,429
layer chromatography using the silica

1109
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:59,739
plates and other devices can provide a

1110
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:01,210
wealth of information to help guide you

1111
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:04,569
in that production process and so I

1112
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:07,090
think for your if you're trying to

1113
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:09,850
develop a better brownie or lozenge or

1114
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,680
delivery of any product you're gonna

1115
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:14,380
need the in-house lab it just isn't

1116
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,759
going to be feasible usually unless you

1117
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,640
have a very good relationship and

1118
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,410
they're nearby working with a lab to get

1119
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:23,190
those instantaneous results that can

1120
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:25,539
feed rnd and give you sort of real-time

1121
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,000
so you can make adjustments in the

1122
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:30,340
process see to make sure you're getting

1123
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,320
that standardized product and you also

1124
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,920
have to determine what makes a batch

1125
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:38,320
right and I think what you see you know

1126
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,869
people always talk about the oh the dog

1127
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:44,769
food industry uses like fifty pounds of

1128
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:46,600
dog food per batch to do their sampling

1129
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:48,429
for quality control and you tell you

1130
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,309
know yeah we're gonna do fifty pounds of

1131
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:53,949
cannabis extract and you're like no way

1132
00:45:51,309 --> 00:45:55,929
that life is like the price per gold per

1133
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:58,469
ounce there's no way we're giving you

1134
00:45:55,929 --> 00:46:00,730
that it's way too expensive but

1135
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:03,608
sometimes something like that and I'm

1136
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:08,079
not you know those numbers are conflated

1137
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:09,849
but you know what needs to be understood

1138
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,369
is that when you first start a product

1139
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:14,380
the amount that you have to sacrifice

1140
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:16,840
for quality control to establish those

1141
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:20,470
limits is vast it's large it's a big

1142
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,869
wide sampling area and as you say okay

1143
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:25,750
look these products are being consistent

1144
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:28,480
these products have these specifications

1145
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:30,730
you can start to narrow that testing

1146
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,820
window and make it tighter and tighter

1147
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:35,260
and tighter until there's issues and

1148
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,850
then you have to kind of expand it again

1149
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,930
and so it's kind of like our universe

1150
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:41,750
which expands and contracts

1151
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:43,759
as should the sampling window to ensure

1152
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,889
that your you know product safety and

1153
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,829
consistency and so I think you know if

1154
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:51,858
you're say making edible products you

1155
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:54,769
might be sacrificing a batch or two for

1156
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:57,799
lab to make sure you have a validated

1197
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,849
business owner you are incredibly busy

1198
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:28,190
in reality you are responsible for

1199
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:30,170
everything your company does you have so

1200
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,119
many responsibilities every single day

1201
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,159
that often you just don't have the time

1202
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:36,920
to really dig into something as deeply

1203
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,149
as you'd like you know there is more

1204
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,369
that you could do to reach out to new

1205
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,289
customers and to encourage loyalty and

1206
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:44,119
the customers you already have but you

1207
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:46,009
certainly don't have the time and you're

1208
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:48,650
not ready to hire someone full-time for

1209
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:52,190
that role either for you I recommend

improving your bottom line

1214
00:48:56,909 --> 00:49:01,230
you know most marketing firms are

1215
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:03,480
excited to make your logo packaging and

1216
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:05,460
website very pretty but they leave

1217
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,679
responsibility for improving your bottom

1218
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,079
line up to you they don't want that kind

1219
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,699
of responsibility but that is pretty

1220
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,789
much the most important part of

1221
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:17,399
marketing right Kirsten and Anthony will

1222
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:19,440
help you engage new customers funnel

1223
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,269
them to your point of sale and keep them

1224
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,849
coming back to you and telling their

1225
00:49:21,269 --> 00:49:25,739
friends no doubt this is a paid

1226
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:28,019
commercial spot but that does not mean

1227
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:30,179
they bought my opinion I've worked with

1228
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:32,519
blunt branding on three projects now for

1229
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:33,750
various clients and every single time

1230
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:36,289
they have done more than they have

1231
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,940
promised and over delivered on results I

1232
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:41,489
love how they generate new revenue and

1233
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,070
focus on that as the goal instead of

1234
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:45,779
just making me a pretty logo

1235
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:47,490
similarly every friend I've referred

1236
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,070
them to has come back to thank me and

1237
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:51,750
that just does not happen every day so

1238
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:54,450

1239

is Jhon Markku chief science officer at

1255
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:35,609
Americans for safe access so you know

1256
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:38,970
the the obvious end game for all these

1257
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:41,340
standards outside of just simple patient

1258
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:42,989
and consumer safety is that eventually

1259
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,970
the United States will be able to

1260
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:49,859
participate in the the brand-new

1261
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:51,889
international trade of cannabis and

1262
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:54,630
cannabinoids you know it's already

1263
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:56,279
starting and the United States is is

1264
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,950
quickly falling behind because we're

1265
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,990
still schedule one but I know that you

1266
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:03,039
work with international groups too to

1267
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:04,839
help develop these standards

1268
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,480
Androids and so I'm curious you know at

1269
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,940
this point from the the countries that

1270
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,579
are just now starting to trade like you

1271
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:16,480
know Canada's exporting and such who is

1272
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:20,650
setting the international standards for

1273
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:23,380
cannabis now is there a an international

1274
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:26,440
governing body that people are deferring

1275
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:29,170
to or is it simply country a and Country

1276
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:32,769
B they're adopting their own standards

1277
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:36,159
and they're trading based on that uh the

1278
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:38,800
answer is yes and no largely who

1279
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:40,899
determines the standards and

1280
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,080
international regulations are the people

1281
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,670
who show up to those meetings and a lot

1282
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,460
of standards are done through a

1283
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:51,400
voluntary consensus process which means

1284
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:53,860
that volunteers people are giving their

1285
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,970
time to international standards groups

1286
00:51:53,860 --> 00:52:00,640
to work on these committees so for

1287
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:04,659
example I am a chairman of the d 37

1288
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,579
cannabis subcommittee under training

1289
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:08,109
credentialing and assessment that's the

1290
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:10,059
standards I'm working on wow they really

1291
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,400
they really gave it a sexy title didn't

1292
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:16,840
they I know I know it almost fits on a

1293
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,639
business card but they were working on

1294
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,769
an acronym but you know they were they

1295
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,659
have a dozen other subcommittees are

1296
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:24,849
addressing everything from security to

1297
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:27,809
cultivation standards and they're it's

1298
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:30,670
all run by volunteers at ASTM and now

1299
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:32,170
there that's the international level and

1300
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,700
in order to get to the international

1301
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,349
level the individual players like the

1302
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:37,960
country a country B has to develop

1303
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:40,269
monographs right so the US has a

1304
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,840
monograph we've reintroduced cannabis

1305
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:47,289
into the pharmacopoeia the Holland has a

1306
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,940
monograph Germany has a monograph and a

1307
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,889
couple other countries do which has led

1308
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,320
Europe to say okay well these countries

1309
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:55,569
have standards for their products now we

1310
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,880
can start to come together and harmonize

1311
00:52:55,570 --> 00:53:01,289
those across jurisdictional boundaries

1312
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:04,269
and and what we really want to avoid is

1313
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:06,429
you know politicians who have no may

1314
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:07,809
have no experience and well there are

1315
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:09,219
variable there's like two politicians in

1316
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:12,880
our entire country that have a science

1317
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:15,399
background but you know most do not have

1318
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,750
experience with medicine or product

1319
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,760
safety it's it's there

1320
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:21,000
kind of doing what sounds good often and

1321
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,680
so we end up with these really

1322
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,210
incongruent standards and we're

1323
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:27,219
international standards come in as if a

1324
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:29,440
group like ASTM which if you don't

1325
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:31,809
aren't familiar I'd consider a quick

1326
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,309
internet search save us some time here

1327
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:35,860
but they're international standards body

1328
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:38,949
create tons of standards we've submitted

1329
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:41,860
our best practices that we've worked on

1330
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:44,259
to help guide this but as soon as ASTM

1331
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:46,059
post something countries that don't have

1332
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,790
any regulations established which is

1333
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:50,969
pretty much a lot of them will adopt

1334
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:53,980
that immediately and that will probably

1335
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:56,019
supplant what's going on and so when we

1336
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,960
talk about walking with dinosaurs if

1337
00:53:56,019 --> 00:54:01,300
you're not paying attention to what's

1338
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,940
happening with the voluntary consensus

1339
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:06,760
standards process you're gonna be

1340
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:09,849
hitting us a wall it's just a matter of

1341
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:12,580
time and developing your own standards

1342
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:15,849
at the local level you know whether or

1343
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:17,710
not that will be even considered by

1344
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:19,509
international standards group that all

1345
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:22,449
governments look to for guiding their

1346
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:24,970
industry is dependent on you finishing

1347
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:26,529
those standards and showing up to the

1348
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:28,929
meeting where people have been doing

1349
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:32,310
this for like a hundred years developing

1350
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:34,690
standards for products and so I think

1351
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:37,659
you know I used to say I think

1352
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:39,519
erroneously or maybe miss speaking say

1353
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:41,589
you know I was encouraging people like I

1354
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,929
actually stopped creating new cannabis

1355
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:47,440
groups we have so many resources here

1356
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:49,659
but now I feel more like okay maybe it's

1357
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,309
a good thing that we see all these sort

1358
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:53,859
of independent groups that aren't

1359
00:54:51,309 --> 00:54:55,539
talking to each other but they should be

1360
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:58,480
bringing their standards up for peer

1361
00:54:55,539 --> 00:55:00,670
review and one dangerous trend for me

1362
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,860
that I see as groups that cell standards

1363
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:06,190
to people standards are not some secret

1364
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:09,640
thing that should be behind paywalls you

1365
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:11,200
should be accessible to everyone so that

1366
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,909
everyone can understand product safety

1367
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:16,539
so they can effectively protect public

1368
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:21,069
health you know in these issues and I

1369
00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:23,920
think that participation is essential

1370
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:26,410
right now and looking if even if you're

1371
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,300
your only option is locally but put

1372
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:30,519
pressure on your representatives of the

1373
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,920
local industry association to

1374
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:34,690
participate in ASTM to participate in

1375
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,889
opera or these other groups that are

1376
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:40,929
working nationally and internationally

1377
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:42,819
oh go ahead when you when you go when

1378
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:44,739
you attend these international meetings

1379
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:46,900
where the where the standards are being

1380
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:47,679
discussed and and and brought to

1381
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,619
fruition

1382
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,969
are there US government representatives

1383
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:56,019
there because you know the US has a

1384
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:58,029
tendency to just poopoo anything that we

1385
00:55:56,019 --> 00:56:00,340
were not involved with and I can imagine

1386
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:02,380
a world where you know we're all we're

1387
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,870
all still scheduled wanting over here

1388
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:07,240
and and this this international body is

1389
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:09,130
making these standards and then if if

1390
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:12,519
the US government isn't involved when we

1391
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:14,710
finally get around to be scheduling

1392
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:16,659
suddenly you know we'll be like oh well

1393
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,429
we weren't involved with those we're

1394
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:21,399
gonna have to start all over again and

1395
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:23,679
so my question for you is is is is is

1396
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,450
the US government involved in some ways

1397
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,699
so that when we eventually do schedule

1398
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:29,859
we can slide right in and the second

1399
00:56:27,699 --> 00:56:34,210
part of that question is what do you

1400
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:36,370
think that we would need to do to bring

1401
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:37,720
our industry in line with those

1402
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:40,139
standards so that we could start

1403
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:44,339
participating in international trade

1404
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:46,949
well I think that government

1405
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:49,329
representatives will always have a

1406
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:50,949
arms-length approach to something like

1407
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:54,699
this but it's not to mean that people

1408
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:56,769
who don't have experience or are showing

1409
00:56:54,699 --> 00:56:58,779
up as individuals not representing

1410
00:56:56,769 --> 00:57:01,539
government issue there we do encounter

1411
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:04,450
people who work or have worked with the

1412
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:07,119
EPA for example FDA people and you know

1413
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:09,189
the FDA has rotational advisors you know

1414
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,480
you're not just like oh and we're at the

1415
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,220
FDA I want to work with them for 20

1416
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,900
years yeah people say that but

1417
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:15,759
oftentimes they're rotated in and out

1418
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,220
like they work for a year then they're

1419
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,930
off for a year and so you know that

1420
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:26,500
allows some interesting dynamics there

1421
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:28,839
but I think whether or not the US

1422
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,369
government participates and I think it's

1423
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,200
also worth pointing out that groups like

1424
00:57:30,369 --> 00:57:33,789
the United States pharmacopoeia the USP

1425
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:35,289
a lot of people talk about this that's

1426
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:37,840
not a government agency that's a

1427
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:40,420
non-governmental agency almost a lot of

1428
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:43,269
standards groups are non governmental

1429
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,818
agencies they're they're independent and

1430
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:47,920
things like that

1431
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:49,778
but let's just say you know standards

1432
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:53,200
process with a steams gonna take years

1433
00:57:49,778 --> 00:57:55,028
to develop and release it took us eight

1434
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:56,980
years to develop the standards have been

1435
00:57:55,028 --> 00:57:59,108
adopted in over 20 states for best

1436
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,568
practices and we could see something

1437
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:04,088
similar with HTM but it's best to start

1438
00:58:01,568 --> 00:58:08,650
early because even if it remains

1439
00:58:04,088 --> 00:58:11,460
Schedule one I would make a significant

1440
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:14,230
bet I'll give you a two to one on it

1441
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:16,750
that if ASTM was a releases standard

1442
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:19,358
tomorrow it would be rapidly adopted in

1443
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:22,000
all the states as saying you must follow

1444
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:23,798
standards equivalent to this ASTM

1445
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,130
standard because it is the international

1446
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:28,778
body and that would supplant a lot of

1447
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:30,460
perhaps what they're referencing now in

1448
00:58:28,778 --> 00:58:33,730
the literature or compliment what

1449
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:36,519
they're you know you can give you an

1450
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,588
example maybe on you know must train

1451
00:58:36,518 --> 00:58:42,578
employees according to standards by ASTM

1452
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:45,219
or must you know have security practices

1453
00:58:42,579 --> 00:58:48,339
in line or equal to the standards that

1454
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:50,588
ASTM and I think that you know whether

1455
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:52,028
or not the US is ready for international

1456
00:58:50,588 --> 00:58:55,538
trade in some ways it's already

1457
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:57,219
happening GW sativex Epidaurus

1458
00:58:55,539 --> 00:58:59,019
you think they need it rescheduled to

1459
00:58:57,219 --> 00:59:01,000
get their products in the country it's

1460
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:02,528
their market advantage you know the

1461
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,849
University of Mississippi with their

1462
00:59:02,528 --> 00:59:06,699
cannabis production their market

1463
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:09,730
advantage right now is the schedule one

1464
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:10,949
and their single license and so I think

1465
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:13,539
we have to think about a little

1466
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:15,848
skeptically is that some groups like

1467
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:17,710
pharmaceutical companies may not need it

1468
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:19,059
rescheduled to do what they want to do

1469
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:21,548
with international trade you know

1470
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:24,700
cannabis products can't be made here

1471
00:59:21,548 --> 00:59:27,518
really but they can be shipped here such

1472
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:32,259
as like again Sativex and licensed

1473
00:59:27,518 --> 00:59:35,048
pharmaceuticals so i think that whether

1474
00:59:32,259 --> 00:59:36,250
or not it gets rescheduled people need

1475
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:38,288
to be ready for the next wave of

1476
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:41,619
standards because even if cannabis got

1477
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:44,079
rescheduled and let's just say for sake

1478
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:45,910
of argument what's a schedule to what

1479
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:49,720
would change for all the dispensaries in

1480
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:51,518
California probably nothing because

1481
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,489
they'd all still be federal illegal

1482
00:59:51,518 --> 00:59:57,699
non-fda-approved products but what we

1483
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:58,269
would see is an increasing ability of

1484
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:00,309
our

1485
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:01,960
government to issue guidance the EPA

1486
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:04,329
might be able to start to say oh it's on

1487
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,309
Schedule one substance anymore maybe we

1488
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:08,590
can issue some pesticide guidance

1489
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:11,019
officially right because right now all

1490
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:14,769
pesticide use of cannabis even if it's

1491
01:00:11,019 --> 01:00:16,719
appropriate safe is illegal because it's

1492
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:19,329
a Schedule one substance a mandatory

1493
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:22,539
minimums criminal penalties access to

1494
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:25,690
banking some of these issues might

1495
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:27,610
loosen up if you know the where their

1496
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:29,740
wheels will grease by a change of

1497
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:31,450
scheduling status but we still have a

1498
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:33,129
lot of work to do to harmonize that

1499
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:35,829
federal and state law and so it's this

1500
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,900
weird area where we're on track to

1501
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:40,210
harmonize federal and state law we have

1502
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:42,130
a couple of milestones to reach but just

1503
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:44,110
because that's happening doesn't mean

1504
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:47,170
that international standards aren't

1505
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:49,720
going to be becoming mandated in those

1506
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:52,599
states that have cannabis programs

1507
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:56,079
well since the standardization process

1508
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:58,150
is so long I'm actually quite relieved

1509
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,489
that there's already an international

1510
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:03,309
body who's getting started now so that

1511
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:05,649
by the time that we reschedule or D

1512
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:07,480
schedule there are standards that are

1513
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:10,349
already in place instead of starting

1514
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:13,809
that 20 year process whenever we get

1515
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:15,489
scheduled you know so well thank you for

01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,309
