1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,250
we go beyond start up it's a pleasure to

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,000
be here this is my first time at the

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,539
summit

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,670
and it's been a fantastic day my name is

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,519
Elizabeth Bennet I'm a professor at the

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,500
Clark College in Portland Oregon I'm an

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,570
international political economist typer

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
to the intersection of politics and

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,839
economics

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,509
thank you about most is globalized

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,808
supply chains and what I care about most

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,840
is workers rights and exploitation all

13
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:39,539
over the world so until a few years ago

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,480
most of my trying to attend organic

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,429
textiles and coffee and following those

16
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,569
around the world seeing how people were

17
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,689
treated when they're working in those

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,390
industries and also paying a lot of

19
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,280
attention to what consumers are doing so

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,530
if you want to see you know who made my

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,020
shirt where was my coffee grown what do

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,840
I want to support with my collar I study

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,180
consumer activism in global supply

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,060
chains last six years head on between

25
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:09,118
Colorado and Oregon and thinking a lot

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,760
about Panama it was story unfold and so

27
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,859
over the last two and a half years I've

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,200
been doing a lot of research on these

29
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,310
issues as they apply to cannabis in the

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,840
States

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,170
so what I'm interested

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,228
is who is growing who is trimming and

33
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,618
what is their flight's length is it one

34
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:31,140
of dignity and possibility of agency and

35
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:34,379
opportunity or it's a one of hardship

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,450
and limitations so I want to talk about

37
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,478
some changes I see happening in the

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,069
canvas labor force what you sort of like

39
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,989
where I think it's going well some of

40
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,100
the problems I think are associated with

41
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:50,368
the very current and very nature of farm

42
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,140
labor return labor in cannabis special

43
00:01:50,368 --> 00:02:01,140
challenges that this industry faces

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:05,159
compared to others in the campus market

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,950
in the last say 30 years in terms of its

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,599
growing and trimming 75 percent of

47
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,000
cannabis will be us as you probably know

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,098
is coming from the west coast most of

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,919
the people growing working for other

50
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:20,250
people at arm's trimming have been white

51
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,738
they send us form and they've been minor

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,409
labor working in town and agriculture

53
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,150
products in the offseason so that means

54
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,250
they're people with relatively great

55
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,959
amount of privilege compared to workers

56
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,310
who are in other agricultural industries

57
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,879
that's not to say that there haven't

58
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,769
been immigrants and migrant laborers

59
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,969
working in which for the last 30 years

60
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:44,969
definitely the

61
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,020
but it's not been what Stockton this is

62
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,780
really different than the rest of

63
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,580
agriculture so for the last 30 years

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,590
people who have been working in cannabis

65
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,230
the demographic today I just described

66
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,319
have been accepting a great deal of risk

67
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:01,109
in exchange for a refill a reward on the

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,750
payment very high compared to working

69
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,870
other agricultural sectors the risk has

70
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,819
also been extremely high so we know that

71
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:13,530
for cannabis grower occurs in Turners

72
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:15,689
tweets that is pervasive being

73
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,280
chronically do not paint that correct

74
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,199
amount we're being asked to wait

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,349
additional weeks or months and a

76
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:26,519
different amount sexual assault and

77
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:29,969
harassment is common unsafe living and

78
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:33,600
working conditions also common between

79
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:36,990
2012 and 2016 the Humboldt domestic

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,889
violence service center said that they

81
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:44,670
receive about 2,000 calls per year from

82
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,319
Humboldt County alone about two people a

83
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,559
year ago miss maybe wasn't working in

84
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,539
cannabis in Humboldt County those

85
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,500
statistics are much higher than in other

86
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:57,989
places so as I've been working with with

87
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,209
triggers and whips workers I have yet to

88
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,459
encounter one former has been working

89
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,670
for over five years in the industry who

90
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,379
has not had a personal experience of

91
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:09,809
some sort of Lieber exploitation or has

92
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,699
not personally known someone who has had

93
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,870
that experience

94
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,629
we don't happen

95
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,819
the demographics of the labor force and

96
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:23,240
the amount of exploitation we know it's

97
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:24,949
at least on par with common with other

98
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,470
agricultural products the United States

99
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,250
everyone has the story

100
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,870
so that's what we've been looking at

101
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,379
we'll take the last 30 years

102
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,670
things are changing I see if it changes

103
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:36,680
and labor force going in different

104
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:42,740
directions for the illegal and illegal

105
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:46,418
markets or for growing and trimming on

106
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:50,150
the illegal market prices are appalling

107
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:52,879
be giving a huge amount of value for

108
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:54,139
products are are largely over I think

109
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,360
someone said this leads to innovation

110
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,029
and communication which is fantastic it

111
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,330
also leads to different types of labor

112
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:05,059
exploitation so what I started to see

113
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,979
happening in the info market is

114
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,230
attractive people who are willing to

115
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,439
work for less money these are often

116
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:17,030
migrant workers new immigrants people

117
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:20,740
with legal status foods that are less

118
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:24,429
straightforward extremely vulnerable

119
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,430
populations are beginning to work

120
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,629
so this is starting to look a lot like

121
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,430
big agriculture big agriculture in the

122
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:35,399
u.s. a place where the most vulnerable

123
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,090
people in our population work people who

124
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:41,359
are mean least except susceptible to

125
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:43,949
exploitation so if you give a sense of

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,000
what that would look like or cannabis to

127
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:51,930
move to the beef big act model each year

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,779
in the United States 300,000

129
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:59,370
agricultural workers report of pesticide

130
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:03,629
poisoning 20,000 agricultural workers

131
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,910
report a cute pesticide poisoning those

132
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:09,180
are reported accounts not estimates

133
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,270
based on reported data so that's a very

134
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,819
very low end of what's possible that's a

135
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,459
lot of people with too much pesticide

136
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,800
exposure that's all helps us understand

137
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,659
why life expectancy is shorter in the

138
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,660
United States rabbit cultural workers

139
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,630
and helps us understand why first weight

140
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,640
is lower for children or agricultural

141
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:32,909
workers and why does children are more

142
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:36,029
likely to have chronic health conditions

143
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,490
that they're not an agriculture so we're

144
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:40,259
listening age wouldn't have we know that

145
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,360
in the United States a big agriculture

146
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,909
women we're working in the field 80

147
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,750
percent report sexual harassment and

148
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,150
wanted to be whether they

149
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,490
they happen or know someone who has been

150
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:56,139
sexually assaulted while working in

151
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:58,509
their fields so if I segment campus and

152
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,879
labor might be moving toward what Big

153
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,550
Apple is like and I started this in the

154
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,639
chorus that I've heard here drop today

155
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:10,210
which is to say we don't want to go that

156
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,829
route it's not a good place to be and

157
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:19,079
that way I think it's likely that things

158
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:29,589
be worse for people working in

159
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:31,389
agriculture services so what about the

160
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:32,739
legal sector something I care about

161
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,829
making this research opening the

162
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,210
conferences is this is a room full of

163
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,189
people who largely work in the legal

164
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:40,750
sector or what we care about is

165
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:47,019
regulating the Neal sector we are

166
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:49,300
positives problem and I thank you I see

167
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:52,089
the legal sector moving in the direction

168
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,370
of the meat industry in the food states

169
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,689
so if you know anything about the top of

170
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,300
the big meat industry

171
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:01,060
it's always rely on relation waver the

172
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,319
work is extremely challenging and

173
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,660
extremely dangerous

174
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,139
Human Rights Watch reports that all

175
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,120
manufacturing and

176
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,519
State to work in slaughtering process

177
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,209
meat is by far the most dangerous

178
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:16,478
this explains why 2006 the people who

179
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:19,489
worked in these slaughtering abilities

180
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,800
were the most vulnerable of our

181
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,259
population the people in our communities

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,180
are at PDS to exploit people who had

183
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:29,538
migration services where they weren't

184
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,570
allowed to work who are undocumented and

185
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:36,049
in 2000 rivers or beef across human

186
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:38,440
conceits are neat facilities and the

187
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:41,120
industry decided we can no longer hire

188
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,800
people who might not Eve we go to work

189
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,610
in the United States you should be hired

190
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,679
we should hire a resettle refugees

191
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,019
because they are the next easy Institute

192
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,639
in our community and we know that their

193
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,070
legal support who are not susceptible to

194
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,789
raising more so what big need looks like

195
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,690
in the United States today is 35%

196
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:04,458
immigrants 10% coming from East Africa

197
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,100
pervasive reach that's pervy for sexual

198
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:12,469
harassment

199
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,810
human rights watch reports a high number

200
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,180
of injuries on the job and a hostile

201
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:19,518
working environment especially for

202
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:21,769
workers of color especially for Muslim

203
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,629
workers so they excuse me Colorado

204
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,220
hundreds of Muslim workers were fired

205
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:28,730
when they were

206
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,860
we have prayer times that that suited

207
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,459
their cultural needs and we're asking

208
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,528
for this facility and help arrange some

209
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:39,349
production practices around narratives

210
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:43,850
they require there's union-busting or

211
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,860
event missing after organizing meat

212
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:51,230
factory workers to really vulnerable

213
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:53,180
population so it's very big time the Old

214
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,860
Market would it look like in two ways I

215
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:57,649
see the new market going in terms of

216
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,959
Labor and labor abuse you know the lines

217
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:02,980
between what canvas labor used to look

218
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,268
like and who look like a future isn't

219
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,730
isn't so clear and the difference

220
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:11,149
between illegal and legal sectors it's

221
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:15,170
not so clear so to illustrate I hear

222
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:17,120
stories every time I talk to trimmers

223
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:20,149
about what's going on right now so I

224
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,159
talked to a woman in Oregon a whole

225
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:25,818
bunch they both described last year

226
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,980
looking for work on a legal firm and

227
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:30,229
believing that the farm was growing with

228
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,688
license and was going to sell it illegal

229
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,430
market she wanted to beat me in a legal

230
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:35,568
market that was her intention she was

231
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:37,849
locked in the basement without a

232
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:41,870
cellphone and that allows emergence or

233
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:45,490
trimming was done our typical stories

234
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,799
that I hear all the time

235
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,259
evenings where the legal sector in organ

236
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:55,208
this past year so some of our

237
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:57,730
conceptions about what happens now the

238
00:10:55,208 --> 00:11:01,208
canvas is legal don't believe that much

239
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,459
the reality of workers lives so if we

240
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,989
don't want to have a problem of big meat

241
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,909
and then you know under the route the

242
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,899
agriculture and we don't want to go the

243
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:12,689
route of underground exploitation then

244
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:16,509
something needs to change

245
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,480
there's some defects in campus compared

246
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:24,009
to making sweaters or shoes are growing

247
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:26,769
coffee the industry's reticent to

248
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:29,828
highlight its problems right it's been a

249
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,629
long fight and they go but follow the

250
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:34,599
careers of many people in this room and

251
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:40,838
you follow in heart to have canvas

252
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:42,639
recognized as something that deserves

253
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,010
the seat of its people and it throw it

254
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,899
under the bus by showing ways widget

255
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:48,669
displays people can be challenging and

256
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:51,220
I've seen a lot of shoving leader

257
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:53,419
problems under the bus as to not reveal

258
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,540
a blemish

259
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:58,759
energies know that now private

260
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,379
organizations won't touch candidates and

261
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,299
football and constantly were right I

262
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:04,370
talked to every fair trade domestic

263
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,949
territory workers rights organization

264
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,529
was a judgmental como students no one

265
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,100
wants to work especially the industry

266
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:15,139
that has to do something consumers are

267
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,389
not your marketing candidates as places

268
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:21,980
radical shopping they don't go into

269
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:24,080
dispensaries and ask for organic and

270
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,779
fair trade every single time even if

271
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,150
they would in other markets or virtual

272
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:32,089
and shopping for other products and

273
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:34,850
people misunderstand the labor practices

274
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:37,610
and need to be educated about what their

275
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,980
leader looks like so well thinking that

276
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,610
something's burnin Washington or Oregon

277
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,940
it must be fairly for the fair trade us

278
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,940
MA

279
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:56,349
so ways forward to close baggage things

280
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:59,040
about policy and enforcement employer

281
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:03,610
education workers rights education

282
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:06,610
collective action supporting the growers

283
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,740
- who are already duties making sure

284
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,899
there are people in the room I spent a

285
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,430
lot of time to achieve growers in an

286
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:14,948
Oregon people are paying health

287
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:17,528
insurance or providing incredible work

288
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:20,109
if I was fighting them and urge them to

289
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:21,639
do to share their practices and supports

290
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,089
us and because it's that vote with your

291
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,509
wallet

292
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:29,470
that's over you wallet support voluntary

293
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:31,930
initiatives there been lots of organic

294
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,610
blank labels that have come up from

295
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:36,250
campus you may be familiar with clean

296
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,680
green or Crime certified since the USDA

297
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,778
Organic people for cannabis there are a

298
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,628
lot of substitutes that are kind some of

299
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,370
those Libre provisions some of them film

300
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:48,009
and a ones that do include labor

301
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:51,929
provisions can do a better job so if you

302
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,930
see something labeled as ethical as

303
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:06,830
is that the last thing it's not consumer

304
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,319
education and I am happy to share over

305
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,389
networking some statistics from two

306
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,850
years ago at Portland I had a number of

307
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:16,100
college students go to all the random

308
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:21,800
samples have the dispensary for language

309
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:23,779
with not and we're asking for socially

310
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,120
responsible and environmentally friendly

311
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,980
cannabis and we documented what people

312
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:33,590
willing to sell us and things were being

313
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:39,759
about those products we gave a 75% of

314
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:39,759
dispensaries of BC not an A

315
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:59,990
I think I said protectors

316
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:21,510
I mean it's not inclusionary system at

317
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:23,670
all look at barriers to entry was one of

318
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,470
the hardest reasons and say Washington

319
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:27,149
to get a license it's a major factors

320
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,610
from what happened a felony which is a

321
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:31,019
result of the war on drugs prior my wife

322
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,550
that we need to set up all the nails in

323
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:35,429
the plans we need to kill Isis

324
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:36,750
secondly well capital to give the dogs a

325
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:38,819
license to be able to Canada to

326
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,200
understand economics and let's

327
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,200
understand that there are racial

328
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,540
disparities in society pretty faint this

329
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,509
is fact this is the housing bubble prank

330
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:53,240
pondered like Spanish communities make

331
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:55,830
between they are all types of different

332
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,870
policies from the GI Bill to the

333
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,759
homestead how the discrimination all

334
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,799
play into the legal counter said were

335
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,049
students on the ground today and why

336
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,629
there is no positive inspection of thank

337
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:07,949
you mission the war on drugs

338
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,529
or at least our housing discrimination

339
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,230
how discrimination is that these

340
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,689
determination of the well

341
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,700
in capital gains in America money

342
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,730
without without one ownership you have

343
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:24,259
no access to welcome you know staying in

344
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:26,200
a perpetual state of poverty that then

345
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,939
to is also types of the education system

346
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,680
the education system is funded about the

347
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,029
titles of your homes and your value

348
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,219
you're on the red line neighborhoods

349
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:35,958
never England gain equity or net value

350
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,120
in your home there was never a chance

351
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,698
for your schools to gain full funding

352
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,139
and become an educated community from

353
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:44,299
those if you have an uneducated

354
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:49,430
community if you have a local level T

355
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:51,198
prime neighborhood if you come up top of

356
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:53,299
the housing discrimination on top of all

357
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,088
these other breath money everything else

358
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:59,419
that or the although now it was targeted

359
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:01,220
at hippies and black men that's not a

360
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,958
pretty famous expand we have a large

361
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,150
population of people in prison in the

362
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:09,198
world have that population being black

363
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,660
me that right there excludes millions of

364
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,199
guys really involved in the campus

365
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,819
industry a two-parent a two of black G

366
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,009
parent home making a hundred thousand

367
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:21,470
dollars still has less of a chance of

368
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:25,319
buying a home today in America in today

369
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:28,470
2017 that a one parent quite there

370
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:33,179
well the wealth gap between whites and

371
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:35,549
blacks is like 12 to 1 the numbers are

372
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,170
just there my life all that leads into a

373
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,759
person into those properties was leads

374
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,680
into war on drugs which leads to the

375
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:45,119
targeting the black men which now we

376
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:47,820
have these characters which it's hard

377
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,409
it's for me it's a rest of the legal

378
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:53,849
cannabis is really just a slap in the

379
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:57,330
face of black America yeah it's not it

380
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:59,639
hasn't it's a fail social experiment

381
00:17:57,329 --> 00:18:03,149
it's been exclusionary from day one you

382
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,520
know it hasn't addressed any of the

383
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,380
issues I mean we just saw the man after

384
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,660
speak about what it was like to come to

385
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,060
the floor in PTSD but the war on throws

386
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,310
on like men we can't get recognized the

387
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,809
pts it's nobody whatever say anybody in

388
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:20,369
my community who asked me to give me

389
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:22,470
it's the inclusion either not wanting to

390
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:24,479
be involved in a system that was so long

391
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,920
victimized and criminalized the exact

392
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,900
same thing and everybody in his world

393
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,330
was attempting to build a personal

394
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,390
economic we're not looking at the

395
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:36,119
economics of the entire to any countries

396
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,940
it's about personal life gay cannabis

397
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:41,509
industry

398
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,910
every every every idea that comes with a

399
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:47,900
sign English why did Naaman Trenor good

400
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,460
at me if you look at what the trauma

401
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,560
that black Americans have suffered

402
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,140
because of the war on drugs people are

403
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:57,529
also looking around from expensing while

404
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,750
I'm one of the very few I can see the

405
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:01,430
camera now this room is even thinner

406
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,900
graphically representative of the state

407
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,240
of Washington which is dangerous if my

408
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,009
dreams are a curse and black beans we

409
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,079
have less than 1% black people in this

410
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:10,789
room so what are we going to conclude

411
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,639
what we collectively to address this

412
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:16,279
issue is not being addressed by anybody

413
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,800
not quite anywhere I was just actually

414
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,210
lovely today to the multi- programmers

415
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,490
might be the most regressive equity

416
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,809
programs in the country but you can't

417
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,759
get licensed unless you know somebody

418
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:28,460
that is disenfranchised before they want

419
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,619
trouble get a license so there's there's

420
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,710
ways of attempting I've been involved

421
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:35,389
with canvas in the stasis 2005 and that

422
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,799
would take off and it's the same

423
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,460
conversation but what we're going into

424
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,798
what

425
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,360
and Washington is looking at likely to

426
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,908
in the bracelet discrimination problems

427
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:48,798
with racism is not my property the

428
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:52,019
property that the problem the problem of

429
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,519
inclusion in the system is it's going to

430
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:55,740
take everybody in this room to rethink

431
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,960
what opportunity you can't inclusion

432
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,700
cannot be you can mean the security

433
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,440
guard at the front door inclusion has to

434
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,940
be executives it has to be it has to be

435
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,340
administrators world versus service

436
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,649
worlds it has to be that the same person

437
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,918
was sitting in prison for bagging of

438
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:16,288
lead in its selling lead now has

439
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:19,350
hireable skills towards a little bit of

440
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:24,240
a kinky because he had a felony was his

441
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:25,980
final you know sigh family my father my

442
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,960
conclusion conclusion is just really

443
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,669
think twice ago article it is you're

444
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,130
doing them in cannabis makes are they

445
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:34,730
actively doing something or are you

446
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,200
using guys like keeper tokenism versus

447
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,058
you know participation slaves

448
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,950
participated they're doing a great level

449
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:43,339
of disc America

450
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,778
so I didn't never come into the family

451
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:47,730
protection that could be different but

452
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,940
is expect some kind of inclusion

453
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,980
somewhere along the line for what the

454
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,230
war on drugs did to an entire community

455
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,028
and in the movie Florida the end of not

456
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,159
addressing of that he's in my

457
00:20:57,028 --> 00:21:01,109
competition and we got into a lot

458
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,909
because world but because that part is a

459
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:05,579
part of America where the drug was still

460
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:07,139
happy two distinct we've talked about my

461
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:09,240
friend conversations in here today about

462
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:10,709
the opioid continued as a matter but

463
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,450
they're still in South Seattle president

464
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,340
young blankets for crack how do we

465
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,629
determine that opioids that are less

466
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,569
more addictive or less harmful to

467
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:20,038
society crack so the disparities in the

468
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,408
trouble are still happening does not

469
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,148
talk about the Disick normal and

470
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:25,919
ignorance is bliss ignorance is safe

471
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:27,750
this is same as place behind each other

472
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,669
difference so really think twice and

473
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,950
horrible which is doing before the end

474
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:34,409
here inclusion of minorities involved in

475
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,580
this in this cannabis community because

476
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,769
this thing isn't going to growth as you

477
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:39,778
started doing everybody just it's just

478
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:43,909
not to grow without diversity here

479
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:43,909
classes diversity diversity

00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:50,299
legalization ways that go beyond

496
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,789
industry formation figuring out problems

497
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:57,139
with that we you guys know how to handle

498
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:59,750
that in many ways but there's also the

499
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,320
broader social issues basically and I

came to this start this organization

501
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:08,149
slightly optimistically I think thinking

502
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:12,289
that's because the soul of the cannabis

503
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:14,540
industry comes from oppressed people to

504
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:18,200
be honest people in pain oppressed

505
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:21,379
people say hippies were real talk about

506
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:25,549
the anti-war activists socialists 1960s

507
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:28,250
a man that I gave you a nice prelude to

508
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:31,309
this general concept the idea is that

509
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:34,190
those values could at least be carried

510
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:36,440
into a system that had a lot of problems

511
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:40,100
an economic system that already has long

512
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,960
then I talk about you know can this

513
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,849
Agriculture don't want to become a lot

514
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,650
of regular agriculture actually and I'm

515
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:48,439
thinking like any aspect of the cannabis

516
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,570
industry become like the way industry is

517
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,410
in the right states which in particular

518
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:57,799
it sets up you know barriers to not

519
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:00,019
prosperity the survival for increasingly

520
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,369
large amount of people then increase

521
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:05,480
inequality in this country in the last

522
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:09,859
30 years is absolutely astonishing we

523
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:13,190
have seen public policy shift from at

524
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:16,969
least pretending to care about the

525
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:19,039
public and more towards let's enable you

526
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,860
know the private sector to take care of

527
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,839
our city policy and determine a

528
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:25,399
free-market level but that's what's

529
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,379
happened is the concentration what will

530
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,650
probably hang with you and then it's

531
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:33,740
absolutely infected where you can this

532
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:36,280
legalization and a very very very

533
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:41,620
significant degree

534
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:45,049
so my broader purpose is to talk about

535
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:46,639
racial political economy but in a way

536
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,309
that doesn't try to represent black

537
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,360
people in white because if you see

538
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:52,190
that's greater you need to do that

539
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:56,359
you've got air and thankfully this

540
00:24:52,190 --> 00:25:00,500
especially you know here speaking from

541
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:03,379
that community what I want to do is talk

542
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,420
about that at the big picture and this

543
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,300
past year has been very interesting for

544
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:11,269
me as I've been asked to go speak I

545
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:13,159
thinking in context where the things

546
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:15,680
that I swirl with here in Washington

547
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:19,610
state you know get put into a different

548
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,279
perspective this past june was invited

549
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:25,959
to go speak and theorize the network

550
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:28,399
at the University of Essex in the UK and

551
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,230
it was fascinating because of all the

552
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,200
perspectives there and folks who are

553
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,269
dealing with you know real significant

554
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,850
issues related to you know the truth of

555
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:40,400
migrants mules weapon violence in

556
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:43,579
swimming and I go in there and I'm like

557
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,160
oh yeah like you're from a place where

558
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:49,579
without arrest for a policy I'm going to

559
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,590
complain about it and and so it really

560
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:53,960
forced me to kind of like think it's a

561
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:56,569
lot harder about what community what are

562
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,700
those connections between but like what

563
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:01,939
I see without fear that I want to be

564
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,069
finally and the broader picture which is

565
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,240
well something changed that I think the

566
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:10,429
way things are are not good in every

567
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,339
sense of through the words international

568
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:17,200
political economy of which the u.s. is

569
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:18,829
an ad driver so I wonder -

570
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,730
personalizations to end the drug war

571
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:24,169
that was the point of the primary point

572
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:27,740
and I want to say that that's how I find

573
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,600
though to soul it was primarily of a

574
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,849
soul was that as a racial justice

575
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,109
initiative is he cool things that you

576
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:37,009
know maybe there could be some markets

577
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:39,740
that that happened many initiatives that

578
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:43,940
we've had so far really they're selling

579
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:46,490
race all right but but what ends up

580
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,170
happening is is the distance for God I

581
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,750
think by now is plenty of evidence it

582
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:53,210
like this is a baby switch in many ways

583
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,460
into the pump he's always concerned

584
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,789
about you know racial justice economic

585
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,590
justice and then you turn around and you

586
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,210
are darkness - just completely forget

587
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:05,629
about it and make it about state revenue

588
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:07,670
will make it about say like you know who

589
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,890
gets to be represented to the

590
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:13,960
decision-makers

591
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:16,660
people with a long money so one of the

592
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,340
the other the other conference I'm going

593
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:22,180
to bring into the sort of dialogue by

594
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:24,339
Quincy was DBA caucus my plan which was

595
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,220
kind of like a breath of fresh air for

596
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:31,389
me because I could go there and start at

597
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,370
a higher level of conversation that I

598
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,620
could go there like saying this and

599
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:38,500
explain this was not you know

600
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:40,299
conversation at all right what's ition

601
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,160
about the TPA is here that even they

602
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:45,309
want to step down and there's new

603
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,740
leadership the DPH prior to now this

604
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:49,809
focused on you know doing campus

605
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,109
legalization initiatives because you

606
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:54,700
know themselves they would help right

607
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:56,409
and I think that the EPA is dramatically

608
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,900
shifted mission because one of the great

609
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:00,670
things that come saw at the reform

610
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,040
conference which is foot race front

611
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:06,160
Center in this country when it comes to

612
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,859
you know what DK is working on to some

613
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,410
extent there are few policy initiatives

614
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:14,529
that do directly manages the grace in

615
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:17,680
particular they intersect a little bit

616
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:20,019
with some DK people right cat Packer

617
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,390
down in LA we're gonna learn about that

618
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:23,950
like yeah they they're taking a extra

619
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,440
couple of weeks to get it figured out

620
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,480
but it's precisely because they're

621
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,570
they're dealing with natural social

622
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,150
equity and so that I'm just going to

623
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:36,399
open it up and see what happens

624
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,310
they were make sure that about

625
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:42,580
there the process now and that cat

626
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:44,919
Packers did big part of that and I think

627
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:48,129
one thing you look forward to going for

628
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:51,420
it is in fact that DK functions as funny

629
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:54,130
mechanism for such a change no question

630
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,170
you're going to be seeing I think a lot

631
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:59,830
more effort to its academic engagement

632
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:05,110
and policy you know faces and then you

633
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:07,720
seen before in different areas so you

634
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:10,389
know we can be incredible you know where

635
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,120
is the actually existing policy effort

636
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,520
addressing Aboriginal economy you know

637
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,719
municipal rags over little such a sort

638
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,119
of wants to pop it open

639
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,420
la is doing it with style there's not

640
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,399
much here in Washington and positioning

641
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,110
Nova Scotia's have a school where the

642
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,180
racial justice things that you guys are

643
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:30,549
doing anyway it's come up with the pret

644
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,380
side is there a point it out you know

645
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:33,849
but the points and you know until it's

646
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,520
getting the license aren't you feel

647
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:37,990
spots or someone from a pack leader all

648
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,920
right well you're asking the private

649
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:44,529
sector to do something that to me is

650
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,539
it's it's good better than nothing for

651
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:49,029
sure it's basically like there's a

652
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:51,069
public interest and we're gonna leave in

653
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:52,899
the prep sector to do it and I think

654
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:55,480
that this urn is where that's

655
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,580
appropriate areas perfect actually this

656
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,829
is so big that actually we need to get

657
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:02,740
this head-on various access is really

658
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:05,349
the fundamental issue is that we rated

659
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:09,039
it so tough to get parts industry no

660
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:11,379
small part to meet regulatory issues and

661
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,500
until the yesterday apparently

662
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,900
to comply the Cole memo which is trends

663
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:21,730
outside was much ado about nothing

664
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:24,110
whether we have solar the Colo has been

665
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,630
used as an s actually a way to reproduce

666
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:27,649
racial injustice has been used to keep

667
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,710
air inside

668
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:33,590
it's been used to you know prevent home

669
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:37,480
bro from from the impossibility if you

670
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:40,519
wanna shout for granted sentence because

671
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,769
what he says numbers a small step right

672
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,779
if you have home bro we are gonna get

673
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:45,950
research real research to tell us okay

674
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,990
at home

675
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,360
I say the place that their industry your

676
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,880
team is that you want counties to stop

677
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:55,129
banning you want you know to be able to

678
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,080
be allowed to sell advertising stuff

679
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,179
it's got to be okay with general public

680
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:00,619
to the degree that they comfortable at

681
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:02,929
that point like you guys may know a

682
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:04,609
little free to operate and do all the

683
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:08,179
dresses are particular markets it's that

684
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:09,379
removing stigma only helps you and folks

685
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:12,460
who are opposing on the world for

686
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,549
economic reasons to me I think

687
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,548
think back really really carefully

688
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:22,690
because you're reproducing prohibition

689
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:25,658
as a cultural institution that they like

690
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,308
that this is a licenses to two people

691
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:29,679
what we can't reconstruct communities

692
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:32,319
that actually destruction effects of

693
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,200
prohibition they're not that I'm just

694
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,849
throwing you know one person in jail the

695
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,038
knock-on effects are the invisible

696
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:41,558
punishments that have happened to

697
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:45,368
families breaks up families in comes

698
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:48,548
upon the dreamers Excel just absolutely

699
00:31:45,368 --> 00:32:03,308
gutted and I think that Richard Nixon's

700
00:31:48,548 --> 00:32:06,009
wet dreams this pretty much the politics

701
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:08,048
of mercifully woodcomb really like is

702
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:11,349
it's clearly represented who's the Pope

703
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:13,690
whose public safety matters right and

704
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:15,730
every time we talk about protecting the

705
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,710
public and what you know that like

706
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,149
generally speaking when politicians talk

707
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,298
about they're talking about the

708
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:24,189
particular individuals or stakeholders

709
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:26,829
who are paying lobbyists to tell them to

710
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:30,249
say that and I think we should then

711
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:34,509
exchange hostile governments should not

712
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:36,669
be a marketplace policy should up

713
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:38,169
something they bought and sold there

714
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:39,940
should be public representation that

715
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:40,860
were a representation in transparency

716
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,070
becomes tense

717
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:47,189
position and that's you know that's not

718
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:48,928
just going to help no black people cause

719
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,259
it's going it's going to help you know

720
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:54,900
the folks the broad spectrum population

721
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:57,058
that is not represented right like I

722
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,250
said the problems bigger than cannabis

723
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:01,048
can see the promise of democracy and

724
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:05,029
have them do it and it's really

725
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:08,639
important that you know the racial

726
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:11,460
argument is is lifted up and amplified

727
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,470
as part of the broader social problems

728
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,400
right they're not just affecting black

729
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:21,569
people the person electical xb2 right

730
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:24,360
want a better society so you know as a

731
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:26,119
result like questions are total para see

732
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,428
to bring up in public

733
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:31,259
can you discussed in arenas where like

734
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:34,650
this understanding is there like in

735
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,929
Atlanta so where you have actually what

736
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,429
about what about us record right right

737
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:40,140
loses income

738
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:42,240
how do people participate what about

739
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,220
patients without HIV patients what about

740
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,870
people who have actually ready to come

741
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,210
together before quite as you want and so

742
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:50,418
forth and get therapy benefit out of it

743
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,069
it wasn't just a marketplace it was also

744
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:55,860
being together not nice sanitized which

745
00:33:53,069 --> 00:34:02,639
is kind of the story the hiv/aids crisis

746
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:04,918
in the social clubs in San Cisco so it's

747
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,669
not just probably more options at work

748
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:12,599
that can come but removing politics of

749
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:14,339
suspicion and fears all right it's

750
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,319
really important each small step we can

751
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,840
take is important I think in this state

752
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,500
like right now like homegrown is one of

753
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,639
those small steps that's actually

754
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,250
removing the stigma that you remove that

755
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,450
like big people okay that remove the

756
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:32,099
power of people

757
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:33,960
China pulse so that's my message really

758
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,730
is that I need to let Social Policy

759
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,068
govern markets nothing that were around

760
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,898
and that's gonna lead to healthier

761
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:42,210
markets you guys are squeezed to death

762
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:44,398
by complying with regulations that are

763
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,409
there to protect the public

764
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,730
but that protection is a political

765
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:51,269
theater

766
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:53,548
for the most part and the thing is is we

767
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:56,128
can't go around you know

768
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:57,719
and continue to stigmatize you know

769
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:00,808
folks who participate in the Kansas

770
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,568
market in the informal market either

771
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:05,819
updates its anytime you have to get more

772
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:07,949
punishment prop up something here at

773
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:08,400
your on the rough side and look what

774
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:12,348
you're doing

775
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,349
so today

776
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,489
[Applause]

777
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:33,230
I'm so Patterson aye I'm gonna research

778
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:33,230
Connelly office Financial Management

779
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:40,409
three economist that support the

780
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:43,429
governor's policy staff and other that's

781
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:46,679
a piece like the legislature interview I

782
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:50,219
work for the USDA National Agricultural

783
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:52,230
Statistics services before I came back

784
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:54,299
to Washington I for others those in the

785
00:35:52,230 --> 00:36:08,010
other Washington sweating it's I mean at

786
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:11,720
a statistician genes so my job research

787
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:14,520
economist with my family is pretty fun

788
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:17,159
but it leads me on in all sorts of

789
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:21,239
different ways but I also wanted to

790
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:23,009
thank Walker and inviting me here and I

791
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:29,868
also want to know the people here are

792
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:29,869
like really amazing so

793
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,800
I went to the LCD to provide economic

794
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:39,489
guidance on how to Institute in working

795
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,860
market

796
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:46,779
I didn't kidded that the market should

797
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:50,230
define us and I said the number of

798
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:53,650
consumers was unknown that the quantity

799
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:55,869
demanded was someone I'm not a member as

800
00:36:53,650 --> 00:37:00,880
well and further the number of producers

801
00:36:55,869 --> 00:37:03,339
in the auditorium now I recommended the

802
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,619
notion that the number of producers and

803
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,720
retailers would equilibria as the market

804
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:14,440
matures and thus the number of licenses

805
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:16,779
should not have a maximum I said several

806
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,840
of the LCB constituents that the table

807
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:26,260
vehemently disagreed I said hey I'm a

808
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:30,760
capitalist so they'll see be higher than

809
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:37,870
anti cannabis drug policy persons that

810
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:40,210
guide their economic system so in my

811
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,730
mind I was saying what a working market

812
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,970
for canvas and a reasonable expectation

813
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:48,579
Republic is where consumers can buy a

814
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:54,669
high-quality cannabis product that is

815
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:58,029
uniform the canvas is pesticide free and

816
00:37:54,670 --> 00:38:00,460
press fit so in essence an orderly

817
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:02,769
stable market that safe free of

818
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:07,579
antitrust and protection

819
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:12,818
so it's a promise we have not covered

820
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:12,818
recovered from the 1936 games only

821
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:24,679
farmers and fighters is instead a

822
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,900
convoluted password of entrepreneurs

823
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:29,889
equal to eat eager to create a

824
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,630
capitalist market and crotchety men

825
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:51,889
regulating based on archaic mythology

826
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:53,720
and overreaching a lot so I looked at

827
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:56,299
this and I one of the things that always

828
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:58,250
intrigues me about market failure is

829
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,440
asymmetric information you might

830
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,780
remember like the cigarette in the

831
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:09,409
street used to say that cigarettes are

832
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:12,740
actually imported so I thought ok I'm

833
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:15,949
gonna look at this from purely like what

834
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:17,689
do we have here what is what is provided

835
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:20,659
to the public to know about this

836
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:23,659
industry so I just looked around I said

837
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:25,969
ok well that old Seabee is is tasked

838
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:31,098
with providing some sort of education

839
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:36,288
material on marijuana cannabis reefer

840
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:41,599
whatever can so I said okay whoa

841
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:45,709
I picked one subject fairly random I

842
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,599
said said said can't getting high

843
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:50,018
cosmetic problems and I said okay

844
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,999
whoopsies

845
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:55,629
so I pressed on the link and it said

846
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:58,189
science based information from above I

847
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:00,318
said okay well that's interesting it's

848
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,190
produced or presented by the University

849
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:11,630
of Washington

850
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:15,079
no offense it was the alcohol and drug

851
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:16,818
abuse Institute and it says scientists

852
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,798
think that cannabis causes problems

853
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:21,349
remembering problems with creates and

854
00:40:18,798 --> 00:40:23,989
negative effects learner hi

855
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:26,599
I know it's tough there's no citations

856
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:30,880
whatsoever and it says science based

857
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:33,410
right at the top so I get a little okay

858
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,048
you claim science based so where are the

859
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:38,088
citations and then so they look like

860
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:39,829
that well is this one professor that

861
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:40,880
used to be here and he just because I'm

862
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:42,469
one of the nice right out of those

863
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,259
seasons of the public didn't read and

864
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:48,019
digest we just he just summarized it

865
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:50,358
right there I said okay well that it

866
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:52,818
well the person pointed me to be a

867
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:54,889
National Science Foundation or the

868
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:56,929
National Academy of Science current

869
00:40:54,889 --> 00:41:00,170
release maybe somebody seen that's like

870
00:40:56,929 --> 00:41:02,838
170 pages order but I already has a okay

871
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:07,489
well that contradicts everything that

872
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:09,558
your website says so what what is the

873
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:11,298
point is this education what is it

874
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:13,569
what are you trying to get what I never

875
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:13,568
the way

876
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:20,309
but so what's the purpose of the a some

877
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,610
asymmetric information in this game

878
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:25,920
who's winning what why are the wider the

879
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:30,180
allegiance is still there to this

880
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,000
prohibition mindset what is the purpose

881
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:35,339
and that's something that I wondered of

882
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,239
you know but I believe all sorts of

883
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:41,610
markets been so the LCB adopted the same

884
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:44,579
provision strategy as they use for

885
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:49,050
alcohol the same number of retail stores

886
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:53,069
exactly that's the probably got the 233

887
00:41:49,050 --> 00:42:03,320
stores right Costco scold okay we need

888
00:41:53,070 --> 00:42:08,730
something it's enforcement of

889
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:10,620
enforcement so the woman history of

890
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,019
prohibition has wide cultural

891
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:16,829
implications you may have heard

892
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:20,070
marijuana is a very dangerous drug yet

893
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:22,319
this hypothesis is profoundly unproven

894
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,870
and reality is not an impressive support

895
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,840
of the assertion the canvas is at all

896
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:31,009
dangerous though the only thing I will

897
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:35,610
say that canvas is dangerous is

898
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:37,650
enforcement right how many people have

899
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,829
you ever seen dying for camels not but

900
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:44,070
how many people have been arrested

901
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:48,630
anyways so what happens next up we can

902
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:51,240
just see but I will know that in

903
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,280
Washington the latest estimates are

904
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:57,659
they're about 11,000 direct employment

905
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,780
jobs in the cannabis industry though the

906
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:06,859
wage rate is somewhere in the mid $13 an

907
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:12,630
hour range so let's see Mele I I was

908
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:21,360
shocked it was that low but you know as

909
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:26,720
the black market still there so that's

910
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,720
kind of that sort of ambiguous question

911
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:31,949
so but beyond that you know what's

912
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:34,559
really the economic cost of prohibition

913
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:37,049
I mean that's what I that's sort of in

914
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,559
my mind's eyes like why why are we in

915
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:42,420
this sort of lockstep of it's not it's

916
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:47,130
not a free market at all this is the

917
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:49,409
small microcosm of a few licenses which

918
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,980
are getting the maximum number for what

919
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:51,980
reason I don't

920
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,269
right thank you for the wonderful

921
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,340
introduction

922
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:09,619
Lara thank you for the invitation to be

923
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,780
here and I'm honored to sit on a panel

924
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:13,670
list of people of such depth of

925
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,880
knowledge about the state of the

926
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,349
industry it's possible future I'm gonna

927
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,329
shift gears a little bit

928
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:29,239
my name is Bart Ober and I'm the mayor

929
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:32,150
from the city of Arlington about 18,000

930
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:36,319
people or one I like to call us on the

931
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:38,960
urban edge we used to be ruled we need

932
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,090
to be sophisticated and we are in quiet

933
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,460
ways and we but right up against the big

934
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:45,890
cities and the urban as that happens in

935
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,119
Snohomish County so what I want to talk

936
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:48,799
to you about today with your indulgence

937
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,320
is I just want to tell you the story of

938
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,600
Arlington economists and how it came

939
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:56,150
about and I hope through the story that

940
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,509
you can gain some insight into have

941
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:02,930
elected officials might be viewing that

942
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:05,300
I Bible too initiative what it means to

943
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:08,569
their community and hopefully what you

944
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:11,100
mean to their business initiatives so

945
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:14,620
first I am always excited

946
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:17,170
thank you as a bold step and I offer

947
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:22,329
anybody who wants to step into business

948
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:25,300
in 2012 in November state of Washington

949
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:27,099
voted positivity for I 502 the

950
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,140
initiative final - to allow campus

951
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:31,779
operations in our in in the state of

952
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:33,879
Washington I've been a mayor for nine

953
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:37,360
months I never sat in elected office

954
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,820
before we had a huge problem cement city

955
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,250
coming out of the recession we were not

956
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,440
recovered we were really in the depths

957
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:47,260
of it still even though nationally the

958
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,570
economy is starting to recover and this

959
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:52,780
was like home okay when we're going to

960
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:54,870
add to the place I kept all of the

961
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:58,000
literature that I have received from

962
00:45:54,869 --> 00:46:01,210
August through November because there

963
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,289
was a lot of any elected any kind of

964
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:05,949
omission that there's a lot of

965
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:07,719
propaganda throw at God but I knew this

966
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:09,099
was the message that our community was

967
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:11,409
getting and this is what we would have

968
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:13,329
to talk about well oh man so the first

969
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:15,460
thing is we sat down and we look at the

970
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:17,139
numbers for our jurisdictions our

971
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,849
antenna conservative community in

972
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:22,170
Northern Sonoma County had voted

973
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:25,059
positively in the direction of i-502

974
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:27,220
so that's where we started our citizens

975
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:29,440
wanted it so we better figure out what

976
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:32,500
we're going to do about it I called a

977
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,380
meeting of our senior managers that week

978
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,019
together because I wanted to gauge where

979
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:40,240
we were at as a city with this being a

980
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:40,619
relatively new mayor and many of them

981
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,349
had

982
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:45,089
positions for a long period of time and

983
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:47,159
I wanted to hear honestly where they

984
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:49,170
were at witness and it was very

985
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:50,909
interesting and some of it almost fell

986
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,619
over really mirrored the literature that

987
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:55,259
had been going around the community for

988
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:57,089
two months those in the public safety

989
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,420
you have been being funded by the war on

990
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:02,250
drugs for multiple decades were very

991
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,440
nervous about the public safety concerns

992
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,449
to the community however they couldn't

993
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,639
really articulate those public safety

994
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:10,949
concerns internally now have questions

995
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,549
but you know the kids the school oh my

996
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:13,469
god

997
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,570
crying all of those things that are

998
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:18,480
going to happen to our community if we

999
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:21,059
allow this to happen our Community

1000
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,139
Economic Development Department those of

1001
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:24,599
you were here last year have the

1002
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:28,199
privilege of hearing Christiana see the

1003
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:31,019
inspectors perspective on the industry

1004
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:32,519
I found curiosity going on there what

1005
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:34,259
does it mean they notice of each your

1006
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,030
business initiatives what's the

1007
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,220
employment look like what's going to be

1008
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,890
the ratio of employees per square

1009
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:41,879
footage how does this fit into our

1010
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:44,219
culture and our desire to be a

1011
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,860
manufacturing community so that wasn't

1012
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,539
really that was happening there and then

1013
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,610
there was just a lot of ambivalence like

1014
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:52,440
I really do you want to do this and

1015
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:55,140
that's like you know it doesn't matter

1016
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,679
what we want to do our citizens have

1017
00:47:55,139 --> 00:48:02,429
spoken to us that's our job to figure

1018
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:04,230
out how to make word what they want so

1019
00:48:02,429 --> 00:48:05,549
we went to work and we use our Planning

1020
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,420
Commission how many of you okay

1021
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,160
intravenous

1022
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,338
these are counties that businesses in

1023
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:13,230
that you all have within those who are

1024
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:15,179
planning under the growth Management Act

1025
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,740
aside from elected officials it's

1026
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:18,838
usually a pepper along with tears called

1027
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:20,808
Planning Commission and the Planning

1028
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:22,739
Commission sets about helping

1029
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:24,690
jurisdictions figure out a lot of the

1030
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:26,699
regulations under land-use that are

1031
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,530
going to happen so they deal with a lot

1032
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:30,058
of positive additional things better

1033
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,040
ones who are doing the comprehensive

1034
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:34,500
plans to figure out what Sony goes where

1035
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:37,440
and who could go where so even though

1036
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,969
this would affect them to Chairman our

1037
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,389
money Commission's and they won't take

1038
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:44,969
us on as research older gentleman or we

1039
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:46,949
thought you know he's pretty fair and

1040
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:49,469
open so let me go do some research

1041
00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:51,989
he began watching people around the

1042
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:53,879
state of Washington will understood what

1043
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:55,379
the cannabis industry might be what does

1044
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,599
that look like and what does it mean to

1045
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,630
a jurisdiction and he brought us back a

1046
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,609
report that was devoid of any judgment

1047
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:05,099
but really a lot of factual information

1048
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:07,889
and a lot of it was this a lot of

1049
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:10,349
unknowns this is the beginning of

1050
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:12,328
legalization of an industry who we

1051
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:14,099
couldn't classify as an industry before

1052
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,470
because it was done on the black market

1053
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:20,940
and it was Revo so we haven't figure out

1054
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:22,230
what all of this with me well some of

1055
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,940
the directors started to be a little

1056
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,170
intellectually curious of this and how

1057
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,970
many - you're intellectually curious

1058
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,950
come talk to us by the job because

1059
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:29,969
that's what we want we'll train you what

1060
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:32,250
you need to know how to do the

1061
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:33,818
qualifications but we want people were

1062
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,639
intellectually curious

1063
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:38,259
get a little intellectual curious how do

1064
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,239
we make this work how does it fit into

1065
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:42,208
our initiative so that way there was a

1066
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:45,130
lot that went on in that period of time

1067
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:46,899
but we also then we had to educate the

1068
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,969
elected officials myself and the City

1069
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,759
Council members who would be responsible

1070
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:54,519
for this so those of you who don't know

1071
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:57,338
in the last 10 years cities of all sizes

1072
00:49:54,518 --> 00:49:59,708
have been driven by data through the

1073
00:49:57,338 --> 00:50:02,259
recession and what happened afterwards

1074
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:04,448
we're using data base data data

1075
00:50:02,259 --> 00:50:06,809
dashboards trying to make more effective

1076
00:50:04,449 --> 00:50:09,459
decisions for the resources that we have

1077
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:10,930
at least I can beautify some data

1078
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:14,739
techniques the understanding this

1079
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:16,538
industry so we made charts of all of the

1080
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:18,068
information all the propaganda and all

1081
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:20,799
the fields of what was going to happen

1082
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:22,088
and that became the metrics of the

1083
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:25,748
dashboard that we were going to measure

1084
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:30,909
as we started to regulate I 502 in our

1085
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:33,429
community we also knew that the

1086
00:50:30,909 --> 00:50:35,199
legislature and the liquor board at that

1087
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:36,998
time another liquor Canada sport had a

1088
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,079
really big job in front of them to

1089
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:39,578
figure out how they were going to

1090
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,278
regulate this industry and what it would

1091
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:43,150
look like so we are smart enough to know

1092
00:50:42,278 --> 00:50:44,889
that this was going to be an

1093
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,249
ever-changing playing field and I tell

1094
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:50,409
you this because it's important in your

1095
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:52,328
jurisdictions your elected officials who

1096
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:56,318
are watching this whether they allow it

1097
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:57,990
or not have seen dramatic changes in the

1098
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:01,289
regulation of this in

1099
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:03,509
verse five years in the first 12 months

1100
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:05,608
there was complete overhaul of some of

1101
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,520
the regulations that affect us at the

1102
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:10,409
local level through zoning and planning

1103
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:12,929
Backstairs cities and municipalities off

1104
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:14,608
for this because I got how do I do

1105
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:16,500
something then I've got the attention

1106
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:18,329
that I've got a reformat I've got to go

1107
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,010
somewhere with it and we face those

1108
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:21,329
problems as well too so I think it's

1109
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,940
important for you to know that that

1110
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:25,440
stabilization of regulation and when

1111
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:28,170
this industry gets that point is

1112
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,670
critical to its success and the ability

1113
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:35,510
for it to operate everywhere in the

1114
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:38,099
state of Washington so we started with

1115
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,300
we looked at the state line we looked up

1116
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:42,030
the state you know when he started

1117
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:44,070
applying for licenses and we saw like I

1118
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:46,830
think it was 49 business and then like

1119
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:49,550
our license in the city of our may 10 so

1120
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:52,019
we kind of freaked out at at that point

1121
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:53,550
you know give you kind of beta test this

1122
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:54,869
we've got a gas form you know our necks

1123
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:58,650
right so think we know where it's gonna

1124
00:51:54,869 --> 00:52:00,358
go but we might be overwhelmed hey you

1125
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,039
know we we set our first set of

1126
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:04,650
regulations under the guideline at the

1127
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:06,509
first tier 1 tier 2 tier 3 canopy spice

1128
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:10,320
you know all that structure that came

1129
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:11,240
into place and so because we were trying

1130
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,730
to build a man in that

1131
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:15,799
let me explain that initiative which on

1132
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:19,909
cannabis industry clearly understands

1133
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:21,890
now we want to provide parents housing

1134
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:23,989
and job growth in the community and when

1135
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:27,199
I say job growth I mean family wage jobs

1136
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:28,819
our fullest $18 an hour or more and we

1137
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:30,439
want people to live and work in the

1138
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,869
community because that's what makes a

1139
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,210
healthier community when families aren't

1140
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:36,769
spending 6 to 7 hours community and

1141
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:38,329
their home and they can take the kids to

1142
00:52:36,769 --> 00:52:40,550
baseball games or they can participate

1143
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:42,440
in school activities the family

1144
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:44,300
structure is better the neighborhoods

1145
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,070
then grow for that the school system

1146
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,640
most of math and that's a real

1147
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:50,780
fundamental issue to healthy communities

1148
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:53,449
so when we look at what the job

1149
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,830
structure was my story we have to cut it

1150
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:57,649
short anyway important answer minutes

1151
00:52:54,829 --> 00:53:00,769
left so I'm going to speed it up here a

1152
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:03,650
little bit so after figuring out that we

1153
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:05,360
have to figure out all these 49 license

1154
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,910
and 2 licenses out there where we would

1155
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,890
start and how they feel enough time to

1156
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:12,259
pay attention to our data dashboard and

1157
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:14,118
know where we were going with it we did

1158
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,369
put some limitations on the first year

1159
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:18,710
we said it early will allow I believe

1160
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:20,720
was twelve or fourteen looser processors

1161
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:23,280
to come in we have

1162
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:26,489
where they will go and what kind of

1163
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,010
study down we go forward a couple of

1164
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:30,868
years after you know I think ten of them

1165
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,839
had been in operation for at least 12

1166
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:36,900
months we sent our third a the dashboard

1167
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,799
and all the propaganda literature it

1168
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,800
wasn't true

1169
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,440
it wasn't our experience we had zero

1170
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,349
public safety calls on cannabis

1171
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,838
operation I mean zero not one not even

1172
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:51,210
somebody you know with the NS fault the

1173
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:53,940
heart attack Department nothing we had

1174
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:56,250
absolutely nothing so someone that was

1175
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,599
pretty profound the only issues that we

1176
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,789
didn't have and they were really

1177
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,190
relatively small was others of similar

1178
00:53:59,789 --> 00:54:05,159
issues you know it was smell our

1179
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:07,710
community wasn't used to that we decided

1180
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,420
okay you know you something area to do

1181
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,639
you think a whole nother tacked on that

1182
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,650
but maybe we could short some of our

1183
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:15,809
local regulations about carbon scrubbers

1184
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,160
and things where we knew that producer

1185
00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:18,449
processors would be closer to

1186
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:20,670
neighborhood level

1187
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:23,279
it's really now selected officials only

1188
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:25,409
want us to distant want problems we want

1189
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,790
to dispel the propaganda we want to try

1190
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:29,578
to find a way for this to work in the

1191
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:31,949
community one of the most effective

1192
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:34,109
things that we did in Arlington was some

1193
00:54:31,949 --> 00:54:36,149
of the research that we have done and

1194
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:38,039
event meeting with people who were

1195
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,050
Deducer processes some of the first ones

1196
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,519
in our community so they had a

1197
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,800
relationship with our Planning

1198
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:46,320
Commission which became a relationship

1199
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,180
where their senior management and then

1200
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,470
he came relationship eventually with our

1201
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:53,909
elected people once we have it doesn't

1202
00:54:51,469 --> 00:54:56,279
produce the processes in our community

1203
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:58,230
we really wanted to tell them this is so

1204
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,170
exciting this is a brand new emerging

1205
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:04,889
industry rarely we get to watch brand

1206
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:06,720
emerging industry develop from birth to

1207
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:09,480
maturation we don't get that opportunity

1208
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,219
here adopted and we see shared economy

1209
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,710
like uber and lyft but their take off

1210
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:14,949
some other industries this is all brand

1211
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,889
new and it's

1212
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:20,319
citing but there's an opportunity and a

1213
00:55:17,889 --> 00:55:22,328
need for the industry to self-regulate

1214
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,269
in this because if you don't

1215
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:28,750
self-regulate government officials who

1216
00:55:25,269 --> 00:55:31,088
know nothing will regulate it and that

1217
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,858
happens everywhere so we asked our

1218
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:34,960
producer processors to form a coalition

1219
00:55:32,858 --> 00:55:36,789
is called the ACCC that I'll need to

1220
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:44,500
cannabis coalition share of our

1221
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:46,539
coalition mr. today Sean thank you

1222
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,219
because we don't know what we disapprove

1223
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:50,650
some of the propaganda the rest were

1224
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,969
still mentioning data on but we need to

1225
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,380
understand the city and we need you to

1226
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:55,269
understand how to integrate into the

1227
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,460
city we need you to understand what our

1228
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:59,079
priorities are and you need to help us

1229
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,269
understand as a business when we think

1230
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:03,640
those priorities so they want the

1231
00:56:01,269 --> 00:56:05,889
coalition maybe every month through this

1232
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:08,379
we've brought in people to speak on the

1233
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:10,750
legislature to state legislators local

1234
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,720
law enforcement has completely change

1235
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:14,889
their mind on the cannabis industry

1236
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,559
probably not going to tell you or their

1237
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:19,598
kids they're a fan of it

1238
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,730
but there are no longer against it there

1239
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:25,690
are no longer the arch enemy to the

1240
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:28,088
legal cannabis so they look at it so

1241
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:30,909
those global relationships if you are AC

1242
00:56:28,088 --> 00:56:32,679
problems in your jurisdictions if you

1243
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:35,379
get things that keep coming at you you

1244
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:36,460
don't know where it's coming from really

1245
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,650
only one you here today

1246
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:41,199
take a step to talk to the people who

1247
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:43,119
run your jurisdictions and listen to

1248
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,939
them I know what the priorities are and

1249
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,039
help them figure out a way to show that

1250
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:50,338
you're helping meet those priorities of

1251
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:50,338
the community

1252
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,869
[Applause]

1253
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,449
[Applause]

1254
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:08,250
all right normally I don't ask questions

1255
00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:12,480
you do but I'm gonna in this case of an

1256
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:16,469
ask Aaron asked a favor of you or D and

1257
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:20,670
for the son I facilitate a lot of things

1258
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:23,689
and people talk about stuff they don't

1259
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:26,190
talk about three steps they take

1260
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:30,389
something better they have interesting

1261
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:32,909
conversations can you give this audience

1262
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:47,578
a couple concrete steps that they can

1263
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:50,239
take in their life officer I wouldn't

1264
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:52,890
think would be like be having targeted

1265
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,779
astronaut training system of programs

1266
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:56,909
showing people how to do it like what

1267
00:57:54,780 --> 00:58:02,039
the step said she had to go to the heart

1268
00:57:56,909 --> 00:58:03,568
was that she have an entrepreneurial

1269
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:05,369
training classes showing me to the

1270
00:58:03,568 --> 00:58:07,920
especially people who want to gain but a

1271
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:09,539
traumatized in-depth look this legal

1272
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,740
system is not coming to eat you you're

1273
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:11,819
not going to go jail

1274
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:13,979
you're not going to be criminalized

1275
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:15,389
here's what the steps you gotta give it

1276
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,440
being intentional about have an

1277
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:18,440
entrepreneur training class

1278
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:26,410
another thing is policy

1279
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:28,449
examinations like really their academic

1280
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:30,368
policy for library located that we

1281
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:32,079
really look at the policies and see what

1282
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:34,059
it is that's keeping certain people out

1283
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,369
and figure out ways to maneuver those

1284
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:38,799
policies or influence those policies to

1285
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:41,680
try to help get more and more inclusion

1286
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,170
for people from capitalist family cannot

1287
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:46,029
be involved I believe that the normal

1288
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:47,950
model is probably the best model out

1289
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,810
right now but as Dominic said that's

1290
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:51,848
stealing the private the private sector

1291
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:53,710
to come up with butter this was drinking

1292
00:58:51,849 --> 00:58:56,619
privacy the government involved so

1293
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:57,940
having us try to solve that what do you

1294
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:59,260
find me yes you don't know what they

1295
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,269
might do the next day essentially to

1296
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,280
prove that I'm not against this session

1297
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:04,780
said a lot of people are I think that we

1298
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,190
didn't create because not what's going

1299
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,340
to make people addressed with this thing

1300
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:12,490
is for the first time I think some other

1301
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:15,640
things are already being an absolutely

1302
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:19,959
to set don't take an inert stance for it

1303
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:22,118
a definitive stance world in the state a

1304
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,010
licensed event we've given a lot of my

1305
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:25,809
progressive racism in this thing and

1306
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,619
nobody wants to customize this is one of

1307
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:28,619
the most precious things

1308
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:35,199
w12 is scared of all the people around

1309
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:37,239
you accountable for their words and

1310
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:38,859
their actions check them on there's

1311
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:40,929
things like the best races that's wrong

1312
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:43,990
we have to be inclusive in situations

1313
00:59:40,929 --> 00:59:45,819
don't be no second timid attendance

1314
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:47,789
stand sign with a Spanish nominee single

1315
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:52,330
at the moment we can't continue this

1316
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:55,000
education program and man please please

1317
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:57,130
your local education program because of

1318
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,170
the clear ahead of me because of how the

1319
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,910
LCB set up where this tax cut both our

1320
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:03,849
education systems are not being funded

1321
01:00:00,909 --> 01:00:06,940
so those impoverished Netherlands are we

1322
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:09,179
meeting Hammer hammer Hammer hammer and

1323
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:11,349
everybody has some kind of sport

1324
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:12,819
recreation whatever the 3t whatever it

1325
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:14,739
is one of the three licenses in an

1326
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,539
improper typically be intentional cars

1327
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:18,609
an educational program we're either

1328
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:20,409
scores your throws wherever you're

1329
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:22,329
manufacturing is located to be very

1330
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:25,029
vigilant about being involved with

1331
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:29,319
educational programs okay

1332
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:30,990
don't see a mr. Clark yeah so I'm gonna

1333
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,630
let me ask me

1334
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:37,559
this is for you I remember correctly he

1335
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:41,579
told me a quick story about how one of

1336
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:48,029
the stores in town was then invited into

1337
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:49,319
the Business Association yeah for

1338
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:51,420
blessed community have in Ireland

1339
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,460
because I think sometimes we're really

1340
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,050
are open-minded but one of the things

1341
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,269
we're looking at has new industry coming

1342
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:59,310
in is you know in every every other

1343
01:00:57,269 --> 01:01:01,230
business in the towns and counties where

1344
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:02,969
you operate at some sort of Association

1345
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:05,070
and Chamber of Commerce a Business

1346
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:07,230
Association these are really valuable

1347
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:09,860
and fundamental pieces in the business

1348
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:12,990
culture is they allow access to

1349
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:16,050
expertise and problem-solving and

1350
01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:17,519
sharing of ideas that I didn't see

1351
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:20,310
happening with the cannabis culture

1352
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:23,130
everything it was very closed model it

1353
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:24,329
was a very uncertain model it didn't

1354
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:27,360
know what it was facing in the

1355
01:01:24,329 --> 01:01:29,099
marketplace as the cognoscenti and no

1356
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,750
idea what a customer base would be what

1357
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:32,670
supply and demand would look like there

1358
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,619
were a lot of pressures so when our

1359
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,588
committee we sent out to invite a couple

1360
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:38,348
of the newer

1361
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:40,929
into the largest service groups into the

1362
01:01:38,349 --> 01:01:42,548
chamber to give presentations I also say

1363
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:44,129
something that really impacted and

1364
01:01:42,548 --> 01:01:46,538
changed other people's minds was the

1365
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:48,999
manufacturers are willing to do towards

1366
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:52,170
so they were willing to that

1367
01:01:48,998 --> 01:01:55,298
visualization from reefer madness to a

1368
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:59,170
manufacturing sophisticated industry was

1369
01:01:55,298 --> 01:02:01,599
priceless in that and now the chemist

1370
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:03,759
coalition is viewed as one of the end

1371
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,430
kind of industries in army - they

1372
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:08,858
participate rotary they work with me on

1373
01:02:06,429 --> 01:02:10,478
fundraising for the appropriate causes I

1374
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:14,248
mean everybody out there thinks that

1375
01:02:10,478 --> 01:02:14,248
you're making a million dollars a month

1376
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:22,268
[Music]

1377
01:02:19,768 --> 01:02:24,068
we don't understand your business model

1378
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:26,139
they don't understand the regulations of

1379
01:02:24,068 --> 01:02:28,380
the taxations on your businesses you're

1380
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:31,478
not making a million dollars of your

1381
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:33,910
expenses - your income is incredibly

1382
01:02:31,478 --> 01:02:36,518
onboard but there's a lot of stories not

1383
01:02:33,909 --> 01:02:38,618
told but integrating sorry integrating

1384
01:02:36,518 --> 01:02:41,288
into the normal business culture in the

1385
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:43,150
community can go a long way to what I

1386
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:44,890
think every every panel up here to talk

1387
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:48,838
about today which is educating people

1388
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:48,838
about the truth in the industry

1389
01:02:55,210 --> 01:03:01,460
first question Todd you mentioned you

1390
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,369
would share your work to the LCB

1391
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:07,190
happiness but did you share your report

1392
01:03:04,369 --> 01:03:08,960
on store path or your your thoughts or

1393
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:10,880
which share the best ones sort out and

1394
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,340
then a follow-up to that if you don't

1395
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,680
mind if you can provide your thoughts on

1396
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:17,539
how to expand access without that moving

1397
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:28,639
the market share of pre-existing rescale

1398
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:33,079
licenses there I talked to the LCB a few

1399
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:36,139
different times and in the first

1400
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:40,400
instance that was like at the end and

1401
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:48,129
then another instance it was at the 502

1402
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:51,220
occurrence you know I think that they I

1403
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:54,050
think they daughter made at my head so

1404
01:03:51,219 --> 01:04:00,230
whether I said

1405
01:03:54,050 --> 01:04:06,470
which I again I'm a freak I know I'm for

1406
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:09,559
the free market for save I was I was

1407
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:16,039
pressing them to let the market expand

1408
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:18,650
as it should better tuck away commerce

1409
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:25,789
to the market can come and Weaver's lead

1410
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:29,480
us they caught business to to guide the

1411
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:34,250
retail system I hire I place the idea of

1412
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:39,170
online with entering into a medical

1413
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:40,789
perspective though if you look at like

1414
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:44,869
how many how many lists can you buy

1415
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:46,489
aspirin not say that the retail

1416
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:50,690
establishments should be commuted that

1417
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:54,919
much but there's obviously a demand for

1418
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:58,400
medical products that my hands I should

1419
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:02,300
be more accessible than one of the three

1420
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:05,809
stores and I recently did a book at how

1421
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:09,400
how far anyone to stay hadn't tried to

1422
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:12,739
get to a you know how many do you want

1423
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,338
campus exceptions I'm gonna publish that

1424
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:20,389
data yet but I will put that outside

1425
01:05:15,338 --> 01:05:23,690
working with the temporary steam but I

1426
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:25,608
think that the market in my mind's eye

1427
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:28,280
should be a lot different I think it is

1428
01:05:25,608 --> 01:05:31,989
a lot bigger than we're seeing and

1429
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,990
there's a lot of smoke in theirs

1430
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:47,809
I apologize

1431
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:50,840
where are the cattle stores and you you

1432
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:55,099
specifically said that cab is in other

1433
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:57,710
words yes you know how do we adjust from

1434
01:05:55,099 --> 01:06:00,049
here we already have licensees go me you

1435
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:08,030
know we have the other issues but we

1436
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:10,430
need access what you know in my in my

1437
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:12,680
mind it should be based it should just

1438
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:14,299
be population based and it seems to me

1439
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:17,329
that was quite simple that you look at

1440
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:19,370
you just have that some proxy of what

1441
01:06:17,329 --> 01:06:21,920
the demand looks like do you do it like

1442
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:24,009
how many bars there are what I mean you

1443
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,010
know that

1444
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:35,219
really but medical then it's like you

1445
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:40,680
know how many stores you have becomes a

1446
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:45,778
whole other thing so I you know we had a

1447
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:49,139
bunch of the Bible to bow texts that he

1448
01:06:45,778 --> 01:06:51,929
came out there were four hundred seventy

1449
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:55,588
something medical establishments paying

1450
01:06:51,929 --> 01:07:00,588
taxes to the department how they study

1451
01:06:55,588 --> 01:07:00,588
got out and said 333 I don't know

1452
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:07,450
[Laughter]

1453
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:16,619
right now therefore disperses sort of

1454
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:22,159
violent

1455
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:22,160
that's like Kennedy's face or something

1456
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:48,019
I would say so number of years ago

1457
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:51,440
Business Association we're trying to

1458
01:07:48,019 --> 01:07:53,750
figure out how much a business title

1459
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,429
could exist in a population base what

1460
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:58,760
they came up with is a very broad

1461
01:07:55,429 --> 01:08:00,589
unscientific her but basically they

1462
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,830
would take the population base and say

1463
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:09,890
okay six to make eight percent of that

1464
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:12,170
number is how many shoppers did not find

1465
01:08:09,889 --> 01:08:15,139
anybody but that's what they were using

1466
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:19,960
to say we have a membership in this area

1467
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:19,960
we can support about the people

1468
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:26,109
fire thank you so much for sharing I

1469
01:08:23,869 --> 01:08:28,759
really admire you and I love your

1470
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:32,240
intellectual curiosity job-seeking

1471
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:34,729
Steven I have print in which length to

1472
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:36,979
this question which is which is true so

1473
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:38,539
city management has been a very kind of

1474
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:40,129
audible approach to embrace this

1475
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:43,338
industry who has proven itself to you

1476
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:46,609
how you treated me employees youth drug

1477
01:08:43,338 --> 01:08:47,439
test mix with marijuana or or you still

1478
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:49,779
look here me too

1479
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:53,599
excluding anyone the puffs for marijuana

1480
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:57,529
from employment identity that's great

1481
01:08:53,600 --> 01:09:00,789
question thank you we we do still have a

1482
01:08:57,529 --> 01:09:05,000
no tolerance

1483
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:06,560
and it probably will be there for a

1484
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,600
while until the industry is more

1485
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:15,859
accepted and normalized into the state

1486
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:18,380
of Washington okay next question

1487
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:21,260
thank you I just have a question for

1488
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:23,600
anyone wants to answer truths and

1489
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:26,119
reconciliation commissions was we're

1490
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,940
done in our South Africa and I saw Aaron

1491
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:31,430
went to South Africa under the title so

1492
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:34,278
that was a solution the government had

1493
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:37,520
to deal with long-standing structural

1494
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:39,980
violence was lost between blacks and

1495
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,740
whites in Africa okay and so I'm

1496
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:44,689
wondering if maybe States government's

1497
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:47,059
local places to do such things get

1498
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:49,278
Longworth when people affect community

1499
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,319
members to have listening sessions of

1500
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,960
Truth and Reconciliation to kind of call

1501
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:56,690
this process of a long-standing Soviet

1502
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:59,090
trauma that we've lived under that

1503
01:09:56,689 --> 01:10:00,979
doesn't get voiced as much and the

1504
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:04,460
employment drug-testing has a lot to do

1505
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:07,339
with insurance the insurance of directly

1506
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:09,260
workplace acting and workplace insurance

1507
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:11,630
and so those a lot of you can change so

1508
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:15,079
that you don't have to have drug testing

1509
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:26,470
policy to get where they sit exactly

1510
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:28,939
thank you reconciliation mr. Clark legal

1511
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:31,510
representation to happen under this is

1512
01:10:28,939 --> 01:10:33,769
not there but I think we're going to

1513
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:35,960
conversation Aaron just expungement

1514
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,610
criminal records state of California

1515
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,500
actually has a process for that

1516
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:43,039
why does they actually have a bill to do

1517
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:44,810
it but enthusiasm that guy

1518
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:46,760
fifteen apparently the lobbyists without

1519
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:49,910
terribly you know motivated to pursue

1520
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:52,150
that okay apparently threat that's one

1521
01:10:49,909 --> 01:10:55,369
one thing you could do industry is

1522
01:10:52,149 --> 01:11:06,739
attach criminal records bump into your

1523
01:10:55,369 --> 01:11:08,569
next legislative burning list say today

1524
01:11:06,739 --> 01:11:10,969
were expunged eternal records right here

1525
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:12,859
and now have a bigger effect than just

1526
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:14,300
your blue American industry physical

1527
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:18,589
wreck but you can employ other places

1528
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:20,840
right through the reconciliation

1529
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:22,970
condition it sounds that on papers were

1530
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:25,520
all that was was a way for white into

1531
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:27,770
Galloway that get used for killing five

1532
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,420
minutes it right exactly and bits of

1533
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:31,730
black families yes I killed this person

1534
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:35,230
this is why I did it doesn't work on the

1535
01:11:31,729 --> 01:11:35,229
body and they would never have a counter

1536
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:44,619
okay this looks like your last question

1537
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:52,040
primarily a tote and with respect to the

1538
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:55,609
notion of access to the product

1539
01:11:52,039 --> 01:12:01,130
I've been forecasting and estimating

1540
01:11:55,609 --> 01:12:02,779
size and services started and I kinda

1541
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:06,020
had the verge of midway through last

1542
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:08,539
year that was independent of the SSP

1543
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:11,590
would be a physical invasion and it

1544
01:12:08,539 --> 01:12:14,060
struck me that it appeared as a

1545
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:16,220
significant number of consumers that

1546
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:18,470
have been using the regulated system

1547
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:21,380
were beginning to go else

1548
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:22,760
I don't know stop using or whatever but

1549
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:28,329
when you look at the trends actually

1550
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:30,130
across time and standardized it against

1551
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:32,500
the population characteristics of the

1552
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:35,369
local parents it's very clear that

1553
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:39,010
something happened about midway through

1554
01:12:35,369 --> 01:12:42,849
the last year before that just started

1555
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:45,489
in bad great now I think this market is

1556
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:48,610
underperforming by about 20% of the new

1557
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:51,130
basis transactional basis largely driven

1558
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:53,859
by the lack of retail access even though

1559
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:56,680
there's by the business licenses

1560
01:12:53,859 --> 01:12:59,259
allocated there were fewer than 400

1561
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:02,980
stores that sold more than a thousand

1562
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:05,170
dollars hospital every year and just

1563
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:08,619
blows my mind and fewer than half of

1564
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:11,079
those have a medical certification in

1565
01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:12,489
market laws so from the government's

1566
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:15,279
perspective the governors of the

1567
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:17,439
spectrum if revenue is important to this

1568
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:18,989
state particularly as our reduction

1569
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,919
strategy if you're shipping a

1570
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:26,340
recreational and we're either used to

1571
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:30,369
this product why is it acceptable that

1572
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:32,800
an agency of the government can use crap

1573
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:37,390
science which is demonstrably just

1574
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:39,789
ridiculous also controller to slap won

1575
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:41,170
something that basically is this is

1576
01:13:39,789 --> 01:13:42,789
something that historically used to

1577
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:43,960
regulate so that's how many cannabis

1578
01:13:42,789 --> 01:13:48,939
norms we found out that they were

1579
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:51,819
staffed without to increase the revenue

1580
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:54,609
and at the same time while forcing

1581
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:56,469
medical patients and medical providers

1582
01:13:54,609 --> 01:13:59,739
to either go into the regulated system

1583
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:02,530
or decriminalize themselves and then to

1584
01:13:59,739 --> 01:14:03,199
basically shop spin through regulation

1585
01:14:02,529 --> 01:14:05,960
and

1586
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:10,189
computer legislation of instances so

1587
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:13,220
that fewer than 5% of the producers have

1588
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:15,109
produced better products less than 1% of

1589
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:21,230
the product sold was meant for the last

1590
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:23,599
year that's a sales tax and and a fewer

1591
01:14:21,229 --> 01:14:25,579
than maybe 1/5 of the access points we

1592
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,230
have the degree in cross area are earned

1593
01:14:25,579 --> 01:14:30,800
they will serve patients as patients

1594
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:34,339
that is a broken system in my opinion we

1595
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:47,690
make our money serve these do you think

1596
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:52,190
the governor might be interested I think

1597
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:54,399
I think Jay is interested in the

1598
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:57,559
marketplace whether he's down at this

1599
01:14:54,399 --> 01:15:00,379
fundamental level or the micro level of

1600
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:03,590
this John's right I don't know because

1601
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:07,340
as I've said before actually not here

1602
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:11,210
but the the entire amount of revenue to

1603
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:15,860
the state is dust and this industry is

1604
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:18,270
very small so do they care that they

1605
01:15:15,859 --> 01:15:22,409
care only as much as the money

1606
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:31,320
right aerospace really care tech they

1607
01:15:22,409 --> 01:15:34,590
care no the reality is that when they

1608
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:37,529
started releasing the licenses I joking

1609
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:39,810
was dimmable cambogia said well in 11

1610
01:15:37,529 --> 01:15:43,199
years I'll actually get to the 233

1611
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:47,010
licenses well they still aren't there

1612
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:52,889
but now we have he get to 530 whatever

1613
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:54,390
any yeah it's a really weird you know I

1614
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:58,350
don't understand what they're doing with

1615
01:15:54,390 --> 01:16:00,720
that but I will say that it was when

1616
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:03,960
Portland well Tory you know made it

1617
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:05,670
illegal to grow at home I got on the

1618
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:08,760
phone with some producers I don't know

1619
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:10,980
if anybody I just call it random sort of

1620
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:13,680
the guys that were a thank you I said

1621
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:17,129
hey what's going on and a couple of my

1622
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:20,490
wives lost 50% of my business back like

1623
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:22,199
week and so recently I was having

1624
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:25,380
Portland one of the guys let slip a

1625
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:28,079
Matthews and I just kind of ate for 17

1626
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:31,409
bucks and it's some of the best I've

1627
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:33,569
ever had and I said okay cool he goes

1628
01:16:31,409 --> 01:16:34,409
that would have been 56 bucks in Seattle

1629
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:37,979
where is John

1630
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:40,489
so what nobody's bringing it back and

1631
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:40,489
forth

1632
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:56,279
I think I mean my own personal gain take

1633
01:16:54,569 --> 01:16:58,109
away whatever my affiliation I think

1634
01:16:56,279 --> 01:17:01,880
what happened to the medical industry is

1635
01:16:58,109 --> 01:17:01,880
totally unethical and immoral
