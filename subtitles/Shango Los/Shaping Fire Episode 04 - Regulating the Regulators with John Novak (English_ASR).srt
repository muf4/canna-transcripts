1
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:11,369
legal marijuana is not something just

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,019
for the West Coast anymore Candace

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,209
reform is spreading like wildfire now

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,460
through the election process last week

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,618
licensed adult use marijuana states

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,410
expanded to include California Maine

7
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,929
Massachusetts and Nevada on top of the

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,050
existing Washington Colorado Oregon and

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,879
Alaska that makes eight states

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,250
additionally Arkansas Florida Montana

11
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,839
and North Dakota joined the other 25

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,109
states where medical cannabis is now

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,370
blessed and regulated and taxed Arizona

14
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:40,589
is the only state to have had a

15
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,500
marijuana initiative on the ballot this

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,960
year that failed to pass luckily though

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,609
while Arizona adult use didn't pass they

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,460
have a pre-existing medical marijuana

19
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:52,079
law to benefit Arizona patients what

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,660
this all means is that there's going to

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,739
be a whole lot of cannabis related

22
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:57,988
rulemaking at the state level in the

23
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,878
next year as we have seen from other

24
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:01,948
states already though that is likely

25
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,739
going to be an exceptionally messy

26
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:06,868
process we learn from dr. Dominic

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,909
Kaurava on the show two weeks ago that

28
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,368
even though cannabis policy transfer

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,799
from other states that are already legal

30
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,868
is becoming more common many of the

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,450
legislators and rule makers at the state

32
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,790
level have zero experience and knowledge

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,439
of cannabis and they very likely wish

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,740
they didn't have to learn about cannabis

35
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,779
at all every state has made cannabis

36
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,609
legalization way more complex than it

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,280
needs to be both because they are

38
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:34,618
unfamiliar with cannabis and rule makers

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,299
are still afraid of cannabis and think

40
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,719
it means violent crime will increase

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,970
when actually the opposite is true so

42
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,188
what we are certainly going to see going

43
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,959
forward is a patchwork of cannabis laws

44
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,599
that are different from state to state

45
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,849
with this much rulemaking going on all

46
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,978
once you can be assured that there will

47
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,469
be some backdoor deal-making between

48
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,539
legislators law enforcement business

49
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,209
people and others who will seek to exert

50
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,030
undue influence on how cannabis policy

51
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:05,188
is formed and I ask you who will be

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,750
watching these rule makers to ensure

53
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,419
that they follow appropriate laws

54
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,930
concerning governance and rulemaking for

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,818
new law no one that's right there is no

56
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,319
one response

57
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:17,539
to make sure that bureaucratic

58
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:20,748
regulators are performing their role in

59
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:23,209
a legal way in fact in Washington State

60
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:25,818
for example the liquor and cannabis for

61
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,769
has already been found guilty of meeting

62
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:30,438
secretly with law enforcement and others

63
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:33,560
but only after citizens caught them

64
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:35,840
doing it today's show is about citizen

65
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,519
oversight of cannabis law implementation

66
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,259
we are going to consider some of the

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,810
ways that lobbyists can try to influence

68
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,908
policy how regulators have attempted to

69
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,318
make rules in the shadows and we will

70
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:48,048
discuss some citizen oversight

71
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:51,530
strategies that you can use to help your

72
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:53,989
state regulators stay honest my guest

73
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:57,310
today is John Novak founder of 420 leaks

74
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:59,628
com 420 leaks com is a citizen oversight

75
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,699
organization that focuses on canvas

76
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:03,408
policy in Washington state their

77
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,639
researchers obtain hard to find

78
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:07,608
information through public records

79
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,189
requests as well as daily monitoring of

80
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:12,230
state bills rulemaking local ordinances

81
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:14,000
and news that will have an effect on

82
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,810
cannabis patients providers and

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,219
enthusiasts welcome with the show John

84
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,169
well thanks anko it's good to be here

85
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,938
I'm very appreciative that you asked me

86
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,989
to come on looking forward to it well I

87
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:25,728
know we've been trying to put this

88
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,310
together for a while I'm glad we finally

89
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:31,069
you know got a chance to do it so John

90
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,900
you know a lot of people they they kind

91
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:35,958
of like to have the idea that their

92
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,750
state regulators and legislators are

93
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,549
having their best interests at heart and

94
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,049
they like to just assume that their

95
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,479
government officials are following the

96
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,090
rules but unfortunately you know we know

97
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,259
that is not always the case so why don't

98
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,340
we start by giving a little bit of

99
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:55,098
context of why 420 leaks is necessary

100
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,468
from your extensive research who are

101
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:59,988
some of the other groups interested in

102
00:03:57,468 --> 00:04:01,698
influencing cannabis reform at the state

103
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:05,930
level and why are they trying to

104
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:08,479
influence it that's a good question

105
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,849
there's of course we have you know all

106
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,969
the local activists who each have their

107
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:15,679
own issues a lot of it human

108
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:18,798
rights-based like the you know the home

109
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,098
grows and sharing d scheduling those

110
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,509
kinds of things and of course we have

111
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:25,159
business interests who are you know

112
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:28,189
looking out for their bottom line and

113
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,430
regulating the industry in improper ways

114
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:36,050
and all that kind of stuff and then we

115
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:40,310
have other tiers of interested parties

116
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:44,750
and what and those are more the biggest

117
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:48,910
ones I would say are the state age the

118
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:52,850
agency lobby firms and associations I

119
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,830
like for instance the association of

120
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:59,120
Washington cities and counties they have

121
00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:03,109
they all have their big lobby group then

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,660
you have 0 for instance that it will be

123
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,900
liquor control board they have their own

124
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:13,070
lobby group Department of Health will

125
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:15,739
have their own lobby group and so those

126
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:17,779
kinds of groups are that's really the

127
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:22,689
what you see down there and then you

128
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:26,149
have kind of what i call the hidden

129
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:29,420
persuaders and they seem to be the ones

130
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:33,199
that are more from Wall Street firms

131
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:36,620
that are trying to come in and basically

132
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,959
run the show and we don't really see a

133
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,240
whole lot of their faces you see one or

134
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,099
two but for the most part you don't even

135
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,650
see them at all they do a lot of their

136
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,520
work behind the scenes but the state

137
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:52,099
agencies those are those have been the

138
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,879
hardest on this and they seem to have

139
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,430
the most impact as far as you know

140
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:02,899
regulating or i should say wriggling but

141
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:05,449
um Oh for instance like zoning stuff and

142
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:07,969
all that kind of stuff and one of the

143
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,219
biggest problems that we hear from those

144
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,800
guys is that they are scared of federal

145
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,570
law they say and implementing any of the

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,230
stuff at the state level they believe

147
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:20,149
leaves them open to prosecution so

148
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:24,620
that's a lot of the big push that they

149
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:27,589
have and when NM the other side of it

150
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,860
too is they all rely on federal funds

151
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:33,739
federal grants you know the Department

152
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,050
of Health gets grants for different

153
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,360
areas of health care

154
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,730
look a control board i'm not sure if

155
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,250
they have federal grant program in place

156
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,680
yet i've been to try to figure that out

157
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,269
but that and the cities in the counties

158
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,090
especially are really tight into that

159
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:53,909
they receive a lot of federal money so

160
00:06:51,089 --> 00:07:01,199
the question that i'm trying to find out

161
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:03,990
is is the tax money from 50 to enough to

162
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,060
offset that i'm not quite sure yet so

163
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,310
that's but those are the biggest groups

164
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,500
that have been down there so what I'm

165
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,629
gathering here from from your answer is

166
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,779
that you know every state is going to

167
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:18,449
have lots of players that are trying to

168
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,329
move that are trying to influence policy

169
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,129
and you know some that you got some that

170
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:26,219
you're expecting but then like there's a

171
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,990
lot of extra folks with you know

172
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,870
priorities that are kind of in the

173
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,579
shadows and you know I guess it's abuse

174
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,290
is another group that you see a lot of

175
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,169
down there yeah I guess and probably law

176
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,750
enforcement too yeah so so putting

177
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,750
myself in the seat of the regulator or

178
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,600
the legislature who is you know the

179
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,060
target of the influence and also the

180
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,660
target of your research to help keep

181
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,240
them honest you know I guess it isn't

182
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,000
necessarily that they are trying to be

183
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,980
bad actors themselves it's just the fact

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,949
that they're being influenced from all

185
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,580
these different directions and you know

186
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:08,000
we need watchdogs in each state who are

187
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:11,069
who are making sure that folks are not

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,870
bending or breaking the rules in their

189
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,459
influence is that is that a pretty fair

190
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,560
way to look at it is that you know the

191
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,519
watchdog is just looking to make sure

192
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,240
that people are playing by the rules

193
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:24,479
well you very much so in our state

194
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,639
though keeping an eye on the legislators

195
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,620
is a little bit harder because they have

196
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,589
exempted themselves from most of the

197
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,870
public records so about the only way

198
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:35,668
that I can get public records on them as

199
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,860
if they were to make like a public

200
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:41,519
statement about a document that they

201
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,409
used in order to come up with a policy

202
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,299
something along those lines and then I

203
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,850
could ask them hey well I want to see

204
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,199
that document but other than that the

205
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,800
legislators are

206
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,660
pretty much off the boards and you can

207
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,949
ask but they're not under any kind of

208
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:00,000
requirement to turn over any records so

209
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,740
kind of one of the ways that I get

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,799
around that though is I'll go to the

211
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,779
agency side and say I want to see your

212
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,500
communications with no specific

213
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:13,589
legislators and sometimes I get it

214
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,820
sometimes I don't it's it's just a

215
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:22,889
matter of you know what what how much in

216
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:24,510
how much how much information that they

217
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:26,009
were actually willing to put down on

218
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,970
paper and send back and forth between

219
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:32,519
each other but as far as keeping tabs on

220
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,090
the legislators one of the better ways

221
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,669
is going to the public disclosure

222
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,580
commission website and following where

223
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:43,979
all the campaign contributions are going

224
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:47,460
that that's a very big part of this as

225
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,009
well go ahead so the work that you do is

226
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,250
obviously very arcane you know not a lot

227
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:56,129
of people know how to request these you

228
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,139
know these documents that you uncover

229
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,149
that that can show the corruption or the

230
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:03,750
bending of the rules or whatever you're

231
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:06,179
looking for and and so you know let's go

232
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,460
step by step you know to a certain

233
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,289
degree on how you decide what records

234
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,480
you want because you know you're talking

235
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:14,909
about getting these records but but

236
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,889
honestly to a novice like me I don't I

237
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:18,480
don't even know how you do that I mean

238
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:20,039
all I'm thinking about is that freedom

239
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,190
of information act and I don't even know

240
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:26,309
if that's the the appropriate you know

241
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,710
rule in this case for folks or who are

242
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:31,589
seeking to emulate you down the line

243
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,440
kind of just give us a you know a

244
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:37,530
blueprint of how you you know get these

245
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,490
documents at a state level well let's

246
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:46,019
start with just 50 to in general when it

247
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,460
passed the state the liquor now it's

248
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,049
called the liquor in cannabis board but

249
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,220
then it was called the Liquor Control

250
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:57,229
Board and each agency when there when a

251
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:00,990
when the legislature passes a bill and

252
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,120
puts a rulemaking power into the hands

253
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,549
of the state agencies like

254
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:10,129
was done with 50 to then the Liquor

255
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:12,838
Control Board go through a process of

256
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:15,320
gathering as much information from

257
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,050
various sources including the public

258
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:22,170
normally and and then they will put

259
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:26,669
together a package and then implement

260
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:31,169
the rule and in the in our state we have

261
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:34,679
an actual RCW that defines how that

262
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:37,679
information has to be maintained by the

263
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:45,870
agency and it's called the rulemaking

264
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:47,609
file so you can request that full file

265
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,200
and then they're supposed to give you

266
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,500
everything that they have on hand that

267
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,650
led them to the decision-making on that

268
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:00,450
specific on that specific rule like for

269
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:04,909
instance the thousand-foot rule for how

270
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:07,020
close cannabis businesses could be to a

271
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:09,059
school or a park or something like that

272
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,458
while there was a an actual rulemaking

273
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,259
process where they had to take input and

274
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:15,389
all that kind of stuff and document it

275
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:19,139
and keep it on file so you can ask for

276
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:20,759
that and and that's that's a simple step

277
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:24,330
to take with the agency's it's just

278
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:27,629
asking for their rulemaking file moving

279
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:30,209
out and in the case of the 502

280
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:35,220
rulemaking file we got a lot of

281
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:36,838
information from that originally and but

282
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,040
we started seeing that there was a lot

283
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,770
of information that was being left out

284
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:45,360
specific meetings that with law

285
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,100
enforcement that kind of stuff so he

286
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,649
kept digging further and asking further

287
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:55,980
and finally we we started getting some

288
00:12:49,649 --> 00:13:01,259
of that information so it's II you have

289
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:03,149
to you not always know what you're going

290
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:04,588
to get of course when you asked for it

291
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,289
but you have to kind of get a general

292
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,800
idea of what you're looking for at least

293
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:12,899
you know give a general idea so when you

294
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,979
when you say ask for what does that

295
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,919
actually mean I mean is as simple as sin

296
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,090
an email to somebody and asking for it

297
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,620
i'm assuming that there was like some

298
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,330
application we have to fill out or

299
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,740
something isn't i well there's there's a

300
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,440
couple different ways you can do it you

301
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,019
can do it with a handwritten letter and

302
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,170
ask for you know specific documents and

303
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:36,860
and for since we're talking about the

304
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:38,929
liquor in cannabis board each agency has

305
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,419
their own Public Records Division and

306
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:48,219
they have their own rules set around it

307
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:53,929
there's like a small fee if they have to

308
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:56,000
scan over like hard copy documents and

309
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:59,509
into electronic version i might be a

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,639
charge there or printing and scanning so

311
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:04,009
minimum types of charges but basically

312
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,689
what it is you go to the liquor control

313
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,600
board and on their page you look for

314
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,400
public records on the on the side panel

315
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,740
and you go there and then they actually

316
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,929
give you an email address i believe it's

317
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:20,149
public records at LC bwa govt and you

318
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:23,750
just ask basically ask for what you want

319
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:25,519
the way I do it is I start off and I

320
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,919
just say public records request in the

321
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,470
subject line of the email and then I'll

322
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,209
say in the sudden the in the main body

323
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:36,320
of the message like this is a public

324
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:39,560
records request for the thousand-foot

325
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,450
rulemaking file I would like these in

326
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,329
electronic format if possible and

327
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,270
basically I sign my name my given my

328
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:51,350
phone number and send it off so it can

329
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:53,539
be as simple as that it can be is more

330
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,899
complicated if you're looking say for

331
00:14:53,539 --> 00:15:00,740
you know specific tax disbursements to

332
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:03,409
specific agencies you know so it's you

333
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,960
can go general you can go very specific

334
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:08,000
it just all really depends on what

335
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,680
you're looking for wow that's really

336
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,830
interesting i'm actually surprised at

337
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,419
how easy it actually sounds like like it

338
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,340
is i mean that's a that's a that's a

339
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:18,799
request that sounds like just out of how

340
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,060
anybody else anybody could do it yes and

341
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,490
and also it sounds like there's a

342
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:24,589
certain amount of discretion on the

343
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,629
receiver of the email tube because

344
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,800
you're asking for whatever you're asking

345
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:30,659
for and that can be you know

346
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,028
you defined by the person on the

347
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,939
receiving side about you know how much

348
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:38,458
how much scope of work they're going to

349
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,610
do to answer your request so this

350
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,139
actually usually they will so for

351
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,899
instance let's say I hit the send button

352
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:48,929
I sent that request in then the agency

353
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,629
has five business days from there to

354
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:54,750
respond back to me to let me know okay

355
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:56,909
we got it they if they are not

356
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,879
completely sure of what you're asking

357
00:15:56,909 --> 00:16:01,588
though they may ask you to clarify it

358
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,350
that might like restate in a way they

359
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,000
think that you're asking so then you

360
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,540
have to follow up and make sure yeah

361
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,208
that sounds good or if if it is what it

362
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,528
you asked for and they you feel that

363
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,969
they have it right in their head what

364
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:19,439
you want then you just you know let them

365
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:21,600
go but one of the things that you got to

366
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,040
keep on top at least respond back and

367
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,110
make sure that you're actually getting

368
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,139
or they're telling what they're telling

369
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:32,690
you is what you want and then they have

370
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:34,740
to give you a specific time period on

371
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:39,750
approximately how long they believe it

372
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:43,110
will take for them to do it and so it's

373
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,120
a it's a little bit of work but you know

374
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,440
in the long run for each individual one

375
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,740
it really doesn't take a whole lot of

376
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,690
time but it's again keeping tabs on

377
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,159
their responses and making sure you

378
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:57,690
respond back the right way right on cool

379
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,309
we're going to take our first short

380
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:03,720
break and be right back you are

381
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:06,149
listening to shaping fire as a business

382
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,039
owner you are incredibly busy in reality

383
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,959
you are responsible for everything your

384
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,178
company does you have so many

385
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,679
responsibilities every single day that

386
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,839
often you just don't have the time to

387
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,509
really dig into something as deeply as

388
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,708
you'd like you know there is more that

389
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:21,929
you could do to reach out to new

390
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,850
customers and to encourage loyalty and

391
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,679
the customers you already have but you

392
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,539
certainly don't have the time and you're

393
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,390
not ready to hire someone full time for

394
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:33,750
that role either for you i recommend

395

you know most marketing firms are

399
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,039
excited to make your low

400
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,170
ago packaging and website very pretty

401
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,970
but they leave responsibility for

402
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,380
improving your bottom line up to you

403
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,809
they don't want that kind of

404
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,700
responsibility but that is pretty much

405
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:56,730
the most important part of marketing

406
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,340
right Kirsten and Anthony will help you

407
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,410
engage new customers funnel them to your

408
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:04,139
point of sale and keep them coming back

409
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,540
to you and telling their friends no

410
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,830
doubt this is a paid commercial spot but

411
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:10,319
that does not mean they bought my

412
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:12,089
opinion I've worked with blunt branding

413
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,429
on three projects now for various

414
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:15,899
clients and every single time they have

415
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,110
done more than they have promised and

416
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,300
over delivered on results I love how

417
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:23,459
they generate new revenue and focus on

418
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:26,789
that as the goal instead of just making

419
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,380
me a pretty logo similarly every friend

420
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:30,119
I've referred them to has come back to

421
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,400
thank me and that just does not happen

422
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,309

439
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,150
420 leaks calm so John before the break

440
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,660
we were talking about you know how to

441
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,880
get the the files targeted to know what

442
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,279
you're looking for and then how to go

443
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,020
ahead and put in a request for them and

444
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,180
you know it actually was surprisingly

445
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:31,950
easy compared to what I thought it was

446
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,600
going to look like and you know I know

447
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,870
that one of the things that you have

448
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:40,139
found is very often you will be asking

449
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:41,639
for particular documents and and they

450
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,740
should exist because you know most

451
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,620
states have some version of the Open

452
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,990
Meetings Act where where when when they

453
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,969
meet to talk about future regulations

454
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,529
and laws that they have to document that

455
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,680
but you found

456
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:57,539
that at least in Washington this wasn't

457
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,340
happening and and this is something that

458
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:01,619
people should be looking for to

459
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,000
potentially happen at every state so so

460
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:06,589
why don't you tell us a little bit about

461
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,339
that so people know what to look for

462
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:14,309
sure one of the things that we found

463
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:16,799
early on was that the liquor and

464
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:20,069
cannabis board were having secret

465
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:24,750
meetings with law enforcement and they

466
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:27,480
began publishing their calendar of

467
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,509
events and we are seeing that they have

468
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,930
having these public meetings and in the

469
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:35,940
big cities like Spokane Seattle and

470
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,680
Yakima but then they were also listing

471
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,500
that they were having meetings with

472
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:44,700
these different groups during the day

473
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,009
and according to our state law if two or

474
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,700
more of the board members meet together

475
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:53,309
it becomes an actual official meeting

476
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:56,450
the public needs to be notified and

477
00:20:53,309 --> 00:21:02,220
their input needs to be considered and

478
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:04,230
they were not doing that so going

479
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,049
through the rulemaking file against

480
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,150
seeing their asking for their calendar

481
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:12,990
of events and you can kind of get an

482
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:16,830
idea okay well what's being publicized

483
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:19,220
openly and what's not and so that's kind

484
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:22,289
of how we started catching them on that

485
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,750
so so you know the the to say they're

486
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,789
having secret meetings I just want to I

487
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,289
want to drill down that on that a little

488
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:31,139
bit because you know that could be

489
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:34,079
hyperbole no secret seems to suggest

490
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,790
some kind of ill will you know do you

491
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,889
think that these were intentionally

492
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:40,680
being hidden or did they just not make

493
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,180
you no no no one put it in the file you

494
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,460
know was it does it seem like an

495
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,110
accidental oversight or does it feel

496
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,100
like they were intentionally trying to

497
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:51,659
keep this out of the file well that's

498
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:54,750
another great part of one of the things

499
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,980
you can ask for is the communications

500
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:02,039
between people and so we asked for all

501
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,539
communications as well on on this

502
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,519
specific thing and we started seeing

503
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,158
that

504
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,048
the meetings were being set up by the

505
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,419
liquor control board staff at the

506
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:15,200
request of law enforcement and a lot of

507
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:18,288
the concern was the law enforcement

508
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,989
wanted to have the full attention of the

509
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:25,278
liquor control board with the without

510
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:28,519
having to talk around the general public

511
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:33,200
they would just wanted their group their

512
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,298
message and that's you know that's all

513
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,869
well and good if you're having a meeting

514
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:40,668
with a you know an individual board

515
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:43,278
member but when you put the board

516
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:47,359
together that and then you're getting

517
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:51,618
into a whole different level of Public

518
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:53,449
Integrity there and so that was we could

519
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:54,738
see in the communications that that's

520
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,319
what they were trying to do they did

521
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:58,788
they did not want the public to be

522
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,458
participating to counter any message

523
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:03,739
that they were trying to get across it

524
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:05,749
must be really odd to read those those

525
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:08,149
emails that because you know when you

526
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:09,858
write an email you kinda you're talking

527
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:11,388
to other purse another person personally

528
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:14,778
and so you're speaking to them in like

529
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:16,728
regular language but they are going into

530
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:19,308
you know a bureaucratic file of

531
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:21,319
documentation you probably see some

532
00:23:19,308 --> 00:23:23,928
things in those emails which which are

533
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:25,398
you know both odd but also kind of

534
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,038
telling like you can start to pull out

535
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:29,898
people's intent if you if you're reading

536
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:33,528
them in there you know if you read all

537
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:37,148
the messages right yeah you very much

538
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:39,828
can and for whatever reason they

539
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:45,048
continue to write their e-mails back and

540
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:46,638
forth and and and well some of the

541
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:49,578
things that we've got some of them

542
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:51,949
saying and basically just no they don't

543
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:54,499
for the most part these agencies don't

544
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,528
have a lot of good things to say about

545
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:59,989
the cannabis community I'll put it that

546
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:02,419
way so so how about like phone calls

547
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:04,399
like you know does everything happen via

548
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,889
email so that there's an official paper

549
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:08,958
trail or how would they document phone

550
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:11,469
calls that would take place like between

551
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:17,169
a you know a lobbyist and

552
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:20,558
and sign a regulator lobbyist and that's

553
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:25,990
a whole different side of public records

554
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:31,298
because they go under the sea public

555
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:34,929
disclosure Commission and I spent about

556
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:36,639
two years studying up on politics and

557
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,580
money and all that kind of stuff before

558
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,159
I got involved with actual political

559
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:43,480
action committee stuff because I wanted

560
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,880
to make sure that you know we followed

561
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,919
the rules and all that kind of stuff so

562
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:55,510
I don't really have complete answers for

563
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:58,799
you on lobby requirements and bills yet

564
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:01,690
but one of the things that I was

565
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,408
somewhat disappointed in finding out was

566
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:09,700
that when lobbyists right or present

567
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:15,789
bills there really is no requirement

568
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:19,150
that that be disclosed anyone the only

569
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:22,629
thing that is must be disclosed on the

570
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:25,690
lobby side is the if money is being

571
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:30,549
spent one way or the other for instance

572
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:34,538
if the lobbyists were to go and take

573
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:37,210
them out to dinner or give them a you

574
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:39,400
know some kind of gift or something

575
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,519
along those lines those kinds of things

576
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:45,640
have to be reported travel expenses all

577
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:48,250
that kind of stuff so but that was

578
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,280
really the only way that I found that

579
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:53,619
you can see what lobbyists are behind

580
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,678
what bills is one go down to the public

581
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:59,859
hearings and see who's you know coming

582
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:03,429
on board with them or to look and see

583
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:08,469
what lobby firms are contributing to

584
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:10,179
what candidates and and to which the

585
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,029
other side of lobbying to is not just

586
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,669
candidates that they give these

587
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:20,819
contributions to they also go to

588
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:24,480
committee caucuses party committees and

589
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:26,849
in those groups there's no limit on what

590
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,720
you can give to those there's the limit

591
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:35,898
on what you can give to a candidate but

592
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:39,929
so for instance a business lobby firm

593
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:43,829
had about 50 thousand dollars and i'd

594
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:45,538
say probably oh you know like 20,000 of

595
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:47,428
it may have gone out to about 20

596
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:49,769
different candidates at about a thousand

597
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:52,250
dollars each and then you'll see big

598
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:55,440
chunks of money being pushed to these

599
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:59,369
caucus or party committees where then

600
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:03,690
they the parties then distribute from

601
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:08,579
there but the caucus committees are more

602
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:10,320
issued driven apparently and so there's

603
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:12,658
a lot of wheels that need to be greased

604
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:16,589
by lobby money in order to get bills

605
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:19,590
passed and that has been both a very

606
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:21,928
eye-opening and very revealing part of

607
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:23,519
this whole study you know John it's the

608
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:24,929
biggest part is the biggest puzzle

609
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,788
though be there's a lot more pieces you

610
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:27,809
go to put together geo I think a puzzle

611
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:29,970
is actually a really good example

612
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:32,490
because as I as I as I sit here and

613
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:35,519
listen to you you know when you were

614
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:38,849
telling me about the master file that's

615
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:41,278
kept about the deliberations before you

616
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:43,138
know a regulation is made I was thinking

617
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,210
to myself wow it's great that they keep

618
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:47,069
all that stuff at one place it's very

619
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,899
transparent you know I mean yeah we need

620
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:51,839
to watch dog them to make sure that

621
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:53,428
everything goes in the file but that's

622
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,898
really great we can watch you know we

623
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:56,940
can watch how our regulations are made

624
00:27:54,898 --> 00:28:00,000
well then and then you know your your

625
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,278
next set of information was all like oh

626
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,500
yeah we can't track this we can't track

627
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:06,210
that there's a lot of money you know you

628
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,220
to find out who the lobbyists are

629
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,288
working on something you need to go and

630
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,690
see who's in the room I mean and then it

631
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:18,888
suddenly that like just the store up my

632
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:21,600
my conception that that that this was

633
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:25,048
transparent now it suddenly feels very

634
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:28,259
not transparent and I can imagine you

635
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:29,940
having to read all of this you know i

636
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,460
would think that most of it is pretty

637
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,630
mundane you know nails and

638
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,019
communications and the

639
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:39,360
all of a sudden you find you know a

640
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:40,829
somebody saying something that refers to

641
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,589
something that you haven't seen anywhere

642
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:45,629
and then things start to unravel but you

643
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,490
have to like dig forever just to find

644
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:53,990
that this this doesn't sound very

645
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:56,849
transparent anymore no well yes and no

646
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:59,069
like the biggest details of course is

647
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:03,179
finding you know which lobbyist wrote

648
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:06,599
this bill which but to this senator to

649
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,820
this committee so that's that's the real

650
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:12,089
the legwork they don't think you know it

651
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:14,609
takes a lot more than just sending pipec

652
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:17,490
requests back and forth you know it does

653
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:22,399
take a lot of work and it can be very

654
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:25,289
time consuming and it's like a whole

655
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,720
whole other wing of activism that really

656
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:30,299
needs its own staff then you have again

657
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:36,180
back to the agency public records that's

658
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:41,490
almost again its own staff so it's a

659
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:44,730
it's a lot of work but and in any given

660
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,589
a year or two we also have these state

661
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,319
agencies will go crying to the

662
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:51,779
legislature saying that oh we're this is

663
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:56,629
costing us way too much way too many man

664
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:59,129
hours to find all these records and we

665
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,350
so yeah it's it's a constant tug-of-war

666
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,330
sounds like it's the the price of a

667
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:07,109
democracy though when you're doing this

668
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:09,750
research you just must be elated when

669
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:11,279
you find a thread to pull on though you

670
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,859
know if you're gonna if you're going to

671
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,059
spend a couple days trolling or not

672
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,859
troll I don't think that's right word

673
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:21,990
but anyway digging through a big pile of

674
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:23,969
documents and then you find one thing

675
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,759
you're like oh here's something that you

676
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,370
know could give me cause to make a new

677
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,950
records request because now you can get

678
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:34,949
more specific or somebody referring to

679
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,990
an idea or a meeting that is not in the

680
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,759
rest of the file that must be very

681
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,900
gratifying at that point because you're

682
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,930
like oh here's something to work with

683
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,650
well yeah it takes some a little bit of

684
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:51,210
training in your mind to listen a little

685
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:56,280
harder for key keywords well here's

686
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:59,309
here's an example there was a study

687
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,829
released by Department of Health and I

688
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:03,779
think in collaboration with a couple of

689
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:08,429
other agencies liquor control board and

690
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:11,460
stuff and they wanted to look at how 502

691
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:15,750
and all this was impacting our youth so

692
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:19,500
they came up with a study that they went

693
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:22,380
out to different high schools to see you

694
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:25,380
know where how it was affecting the kids

695
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:32,510
and some of the conclusions they came up

696
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:35,010
with were left me scratching my head so

697
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:36,660
but just by the sheer fact that they did

698
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:39,379
a study and sent people out makes you

699
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:42,019
realize aha there's a document there

700
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:45,120
there's a there's a list of questions

701
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:50,930
somewhere that they were asking people

702
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:54,629
so when I saw the the file of it was a

703
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:59,730
basically what the information that I

704
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:01,920
saw that led me to this was a PowerPoint

705
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:05,789
presentation put on by the department

706
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:08,550
health that they were going to they were

707
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:10,019
presenting to legislators so I was

708
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:11,879
reading down through all the slides and

709
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:15,980
I kept coming across these different

710
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,960
study points and a couple of them really

711
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,569
had me scratching my head so I was like

712
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,009
okay I need to see the study and what

713
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:25,289
we're all this information was coming

714
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:28,650
from because one of the things they were

715
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:30,450
claiming was that the minorities were

716
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:34,400
having a harder problem with it in the

717
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:39,420
schools then the white folks I'm like

718
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:42,420
this is sounding a little I don't want

719
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,740
to say racist but you know all the

720
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:48,000
research that I've seen in the past

721
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:51,180
showed that of blacks and whites use

722
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,839
cannabis at a pretty even rate so why

723
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,430
they were saying that the black kids in

724
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,230
school are having a harder time with it

725
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:02,740
and and you know I want to know more

726
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,779
so I asked for the actual study and that

727
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,460
I just got that a couple days ago I

728
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:09,190
haven't had a chance to go through and

729
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,259
look at it but despite you know seeing

730
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:14,820
on there they had it done a study that I

731
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:17,679
knew then okay I can ask for that study

732
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:20,168
yeah right on i follow that and it makes

733
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,960
for some pretty detailed reading I'm

734
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:26,380
sure so so hey we're gonna take it it's

735

775
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:08,470
our guest this week is John Novak of 420

777
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:14,230
show today you have described you know

778
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,789
a lot of detail oriented work a lot of

779
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,579
you know kind of pushing against the

780
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:21,279
bureaucracy but we know also with

781
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:23,940
important winds of being able to keep

782
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,830
regulators honest and essentially

783
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,720
defending the citizenry of the state and

784
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:30,759
the goal you know of course the show is

785
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,909
to inspire people in other states that

786
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,310
are you know just coming on line with

787
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:38,049
cannabis and and starting to normalize

788
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,539
and moving towards some kind of

789
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,820
legalization to inspire folks to you

790
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:45,730
know to watch their their own state

791
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,070
regulators so you know I got to ask you

792
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:51,389
you know what are some of the challenges

793
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:54,850
personally to doing this kind of work oh

794
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:58,559
the personal challenges a the hardest

795
00:35:54,849 --> 00:36:03,210
one is just keeping yourself motivated

796
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:08,650
to go through all this boring stuff and

797
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:11,320
that especially when you get in you know

798
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:15,190
gigabyte after gigabyte of information

799
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:17,920
and that's that's one of the hardest

800
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,730
things to do trying to get other people

801
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,039
to help out that that's been a struggle

802
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:28,119
because you know it's not the funnest

803
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:29,829
reports due and the rewards you know you

804
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:33,809
may have to go weeks if not months

805
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:38,889
before you see any kind of results so it

806
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:41,230
that's a it's a good question yeah but

807
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:43,420
you know obviously you're doing it and

808
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,250
you're passionate about it and so you

809
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,139
know you've got to know that it's

810
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,210
important I mean somebody's got to watch

811
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:50,949
the government well you know why for you

812
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:53,949
do you feel that it's important that

813
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:55,719
that people like you stand up and watch

814
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:57,819
the government to make sure that they

815
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:03,669
are they are doing things by rule of law

816
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:05,920
well I actually started doing I would

817
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:12,579
say my skills on this came actually from

818
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:16,630
doing due diligence on stock for the

819
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:18,489
stock market and it takes a lot of going

820
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:21,369
through and reading all the the company

821
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:22,379
documents and and figuring out you know

822
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,639
where

823
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,500
money is coming in where it's going out

824
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,179
if they actually have a product and all

825
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,099
that kind of stuff so it just takes a

826
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:33,368
lot of going through a lot of boring

827
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:37,960
boring information but it's it is super

828
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:41,260
important to do if you take investing

829
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,050
seriously so that was kind of the

830
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:46,330
training that I had going into this so

831
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,039
and it really kind of started out for me

832
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,949
of course I wanted to see where all the

833
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:58,360
laws were going since I am a patient

834
00:37:50,949 --> 00:38:00,699
myself but I also wanted to see how what

835
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,610
kind of environment I would be getting

836
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:06,759
myself into if I decided to enter into

837
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:10,150
the industry and that was really the

838
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,250
biggest push for me of why I wanted to

839
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,590
do all this because if I you know first

840
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,599
off we got you know let's let's be

841
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:21,369
honest here this is still against

842
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:24,190
federal law so there's a lot in and of

843
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:25,840
itself means you gotta so many different

844
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,490
areas of law that you got to make sure

845
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,050
your butt's covered on you got to follow

846
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:31,358
not only state law you got to follow

847
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:34,590
what the feds are doing kind of get an

848
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:37,960
idea of what other states are doing so

849
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:39,608
that attention to detail in and due

850
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,000
diligence is really what keep me might

851
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:46,269
push to do it the benefits of doing it

852
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,150
though are absolutely wonderful because

853
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:51,009
instead of relying on let's say what the

854
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:55,599
press is telling you what's going on or

855
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:58,270
what any individual legislator or even

856
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,368
any individual activist might be telling

857
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:02,619
you what's going on when you have the

858
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,780
actual documents in front of you you see

859
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:08,108
what's being said you see what's going

860
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:10,060
on you know you just you have a much

861
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:13,269
better understanding of the entire

862
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:15,429
situation because you're taking it from

863
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:17,559
the horse's mouth instead of you know

864
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:19,569
different spins on it and and that I

865
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:24,460
think is one of the most valuable parts

866
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:28,750
and of course the to a certain degree I

867
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:31,019
wish it was more keeping politicians and

868
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:35,820
the state agencies honest

869
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:39,269
and the biggest threat that if we don't

870
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,010
do this is that they'll just think that

871
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,989
nobody is watching and they can get it

872
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:47,100
away with whatever they want they don't

873
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:49,559
then you they'll take they won't take

874
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:53,219
the full steps to completely document

875
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:56,099
what they're doing at to the worst

876
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:58,730
extremes of corruption that we've you

877
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:03,449
know you hear about in the news and

878
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:05,789
unfortunately when I talk to other

879
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:08,669
activists and even some legislators and

880
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:12,090
people in this they stayed as a whole

881
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:15,480
our countries and local government is

882
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:20,460
becoming more corrupt than then more

883
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:23,699
honest these days so that is you know in

884
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,800
a lot of ways I think that this activism

885
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:29,219
really has more to do with about open

886
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,780
government that does about cannabis you

887
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:33,029
know this might be kind of a bittersweet

888
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,250
question but you know I know you've

889
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:37,290
dedicated well at least your life right

890
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,599
now to this because this is your your

891
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:41,130
main thing but you know how do you know

892
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,960
when you're succeeding because this

893
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,269
seems like you are you know you're

894
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,670
working on this ocean trove of

895
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:50,789
information you know how do you how do

896
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:52,110
you know when you're winning well the

897
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:53,579
easiest way to know that when you're

898
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,090
winning is of course you get attention

899
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:59,250
from the press or our legislators and

900
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,960
they'll come up and say hey we want to

901
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,119
change it you know what you what you're

902
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,720
seeing there we want to change that's

903
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,920
that's an immediate type of win and and

904
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,269
that can be very gratifying

905
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,210
unfortunately though most of the winds

906
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:20,159
come in ways that you you can kind of

907
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:23,820
see your information is influencing the

908
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:26,819
public debate even though your name is

909
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,450
not specifically mentioned I see that a

910
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:32,670
lot in the let's I won't bring up any

911
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:35,059
big names but some of the bigger

912
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:37,920
newspapers in this in the area

913
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:40,049
absolutely refused to have to publish my

914
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,240
name for 20 leaks or anything to do with

915
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,240
it

916
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:46,459
as they are interested in a

917
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:49,669
multi-billion dollar industry continuing

918
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,820
which I'm all for two but let's you know

919
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:55,490
let's do it honestly here guys but so I

920
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,350
do see a lot of that though when a

921
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:59,629
bigger story will come out and then

922
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:01,880
you'll and you'll kind of start hearing

923
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:05,809
about you know the debate let's say for

924
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,869
instance on the there was a massive leak

925
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:11,480
we're like a control board accidentally

926
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:17,890
turned over private information on

927
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:22,429
applicants well some of the cannabis

928
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:25,029
reporters jumped on that immediately but

929
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:27,440
then at the higher level of you know of

930
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:31,760
you know let's say like through seattle

931
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,380
times the you know the bigger the

932
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,020
Spokane chronicle or whatever the bigger

933
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:42,019
newspapers they didn't cover that until

934
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:45,139
the Liquor Control Board actually

935
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:51,500
started sending out letters to people

936
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:53,509
then the big news got in but still for

937
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,480
the most part we weren't we didn't get a

938
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:59,720
lot of credit for that link but then we

939
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,090
started seeing a bigger issue being

940
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:05,839
talked about about prayed about patient

941
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:08,869
privacy and so sometimes you don't get

942
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,510
the credit but you can see that your

943
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:14,150
point was made and the debate is

944
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,970
beginning and then so you have to kind

945
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:18,139
of a lot of it is you don't you don't

946
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,868
get a lot of credit for some of this

947
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:22,819
stuff but the debate moves forward and

948
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:26,059
that's really the end that should be the

949
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:28,309
the bottom line if the debate is moving

950
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:29,900
forward you're winning right on that

951
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:32,150
makes a lot of sense so let's let's

952
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,599
finish up with this last question John

953
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:37,490
so you know if if you know my goal with

954
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,858
the show is that I wanted to be able to

955
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:42,589
reach out to our listeners across the

956
00:43:39,858 --> 00:43:44,000
country and maybe have them hear your

957
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:47,240
story about what you're doing in

958
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,309
Washington and inspire them to do that

959
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:51,949
in their own state because you know if

960
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:53,889
it takes your full time to do Washington

961
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:56,019
you know we need at least four

962
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:57,819
nine other people across the country to

963
00:43:56,019 --> 00:44:01,230
be doing this so that each state can be

964
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:03,070
covered so so so somebody out there is

965
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,500
listening and they're listening to the

966
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:07,539
work that you're doing and it sounds you

967
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,280
know interesting and engaging to them

968
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:11,590
and they're thinking about doing this in

969
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,930
their own state what would you say to

970
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:19,300
them to help inspire them to move

971
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:21,639
forward you're gonna find this is both

972
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,650
the hardest and most but at the same

973
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:27,609
time most rewarding thing that you'll do

974
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:31,690
your you'll you're going to find a lot

975
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:35,890
of a lot of garbage in there that just

976
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:38,619
you know has no real revelant or a real

977
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:42,960
no meaning to exactly what it is you're

978
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:46,329
looking for but you have to keep going

979
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:50,139
one of the things that I that drives me

980
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:52,480
is the human rights angle that every

981
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:55,179
person out there should have the right

982
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,990
to plant a seed and take care of

983
00:44:55,179 --> 00:45:03,089
themselves so when you have a focus like

984
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:06,009
that it kind of narrows down to a degree

985
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:10,360
what specifically you're going for so

986
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:13,240
and it helps so and the other thing it

987
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:16,120
does is it when you're sending out those

988
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:20,349
requests it puts those agencies on

989
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:22,389
notice that you're watching them and for

990
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:23,829
the most sometimes you know they're so

991
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:25,710
big they have so much money and

992
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:29,409
influence they don't really care but

993
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:32,860
when when you take that information and

994
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:35,969
then make it public and then suddenly

995
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:40,140
they take it a little more seriously and

996
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:43,569
that's that's what I begin defines that

997
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:46,900
you get not only do you get the

998
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:50,890
information that you're looking for in a

999
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:55,079
more complete picture but you also begin

1000
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:58,210
to develop a reputation especially with

1001
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,670
legislators that while they may not like

1002
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,250
what you're doing they know why you're

1003
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,470
doing it and for the most part they

1004
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:08,409
really don't have a

1005
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:14,169
much to say to the negative site on that

1006
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:17,440
and being able to inform your fellow

1007
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:23,108
activists with exactly what's going on

1008
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:27,880
with these laws and so it helps it helps

1009
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:30,759
your group to really define where the

1010
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,680
issues you need to focus are a lot of us

1011
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,470
get caught up and a lot of the

1012
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:37,929
extraneous stuff and you know and the

1013
00:46:35,469 --> 00:46:40,059
Red Hat's versus the blue hats or should

1014
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:43,899
we have like six plans first is eight

1015
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:45,989
plants or four and a lot of times you

1016
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,760
get groups that kind of split apart and

1017
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:51,879
get trapped into a lot of that stuff

1018
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,940
whereas if you you focus on specific

1019
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:59,200
issues and you can see where the enemy

1020
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,519
or the obstacle is it it becomes easier

1021
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,379
when you go in with a handful of

1022
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:06,250
documents especially when they're on

1023
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:09,309
their own words and you can say this is

1024
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:11,800
why it needs to be fixed and here in the

1025
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:15,190
end actually that's another point of the

1026
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:18,070
things you can find a lot of stuff

1027
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:20,559
that's wrong and they do want to hear

1028
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:23,680
some of that but really what they're

1029
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,889
looking for is okay how do we make it

1030
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:29,440
right but you cannot get to that step of

1031
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:31,750
how do I make it right until you have

1032
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,059
all the information in front of you and

1033
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:36,639
that's the biggest part of why I think

1034
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:38,980
this is most important John thank you
