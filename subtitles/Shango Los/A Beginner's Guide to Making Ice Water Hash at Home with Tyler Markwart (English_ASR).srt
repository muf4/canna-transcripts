1
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:24,960
hi welcome my name is Tyler marquart and

2
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,000
I am here today via Shango lots and

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,420
shaping fire and we're going to show you

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,899
how to make bubble hash using a washing

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,719
machine uh kind of more on a way of

6
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,399
entry level or in a position in which

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,039
maybe you don't have access to every

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,799
single tool that these multi-million

9
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,960
dollar facilities have that you may see

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,759
on Instagram we think this is an

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,739
important way to help people kind of get

12
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,280
into the industry get into the

13
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,799
hashmaking and just making hash for

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,379
yourself as a medical patient or just a

15
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,899
home grower there's a lot of different

16
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,000
tools out there and ways to make hash

17
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,719
you can make it by hand you can make it

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,760
by using the machine and this way is

19
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:13,079
going to try to show you an efficient

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,859
way to bring that home and and we'll be

21
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,780
able to have really high quality hash at

22
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,219
your disposal

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,960
So today we're going to be talking about

24
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,759
the different types of tools we use

25
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,158
we're going to be talking about the

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,459
different types of material all the

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,240
steps that go into the production of

28
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:36,839
this hash using this machine this is a

29
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:39,719
20 gallon washing machine this is an

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,540
older model that I gifted Shango years

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,819
ago we've been using it every year for

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,880
probably the last five years to make

33
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,519
hash and you've seen other videos with

34
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,078
the material that's come out and so this

35
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,019
is a great machine they're they're

36
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,578
already in the last they handle up to

37
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,140
about 900 grams you could probably put

38
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,239
about thousand grams of material in

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,820
there and they would still put out a

40
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,578
high quality product

41
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:07,679
but nonetheless you can get these for

42
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,538
used for a couple hundred dollars off of

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,939
Craigslist you can get them new offline

44
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,919
for a few hundred dollars as well uh

45
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,120
probably up to 500 bucks with shipping

46
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,159
and whatnot

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,620
um you know as of the these days here

48
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,719
the prices change pretty quickly but

49
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,000
um 20 gallon machines are great to go

50
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,818
with if you if you're running uh some

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,680
bigger outdoor plants uh if you have uh

52
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:30,238
you know more than a couple thousand

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,099
grams of material and you want to get

54
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,259
through it in a couple days this is a

55
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,539
great way to do it if you don't produce

56
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,699
that much material all at once and

57
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,019
you're getting it over time there are

58
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,000
also five gallon machines that are

59
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,519
available too they're smaller they work

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,560
just as well they're efficient and they

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,379
get you a good material uh to start with

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,840
to get your medicine you also can do

63
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:55,620
hand washing too uh by using a power

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,159
drill or just a spatula and pushing the

65
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,420
material around with your hand a lot of

66
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,639
people actually will get into this later

67
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,139
prefer that method because it gives you

68
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,059
all uh what you would consider a much

69
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,878
higher quality product because there's

70
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,580
less agitation and you're getting the

71
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:15,120
the most ripe trichomes off the head of

72
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,400
the uh the plant material but if you're

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,379
trying to get the most quality highest

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,840
quality and the most material at once

75
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:24,079
the the machine is the best option to uh

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,360
to go to

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,180
another tool that's super important that

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,080
you need is going to be a garbage can

79
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,300
um

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,620
some people will say Okay garbage cans

81
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,900
are not the ideal you need to use food

82
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,959
grade yes ideally using food grade

83
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,780
everything would be the optimal thing to

84
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,360
do but again not everybody has access to

85
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,060
food grade quality materials and they

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,379
still want to try to make hash and is

87
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,560
this going to give you a tainted product

88
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:55,859
uh probably not you know over time it

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,299
may degrade and leech but if you're

90
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,340
running the first few times and whatnot

91
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,840
it's not going to we've been doing it

92
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,620
for years and we're still running

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,780
marathons so again

94
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,239
you always want to try to lean towards

95
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,280
the best practices and and refine your

96
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,500
Technique as you go along using better

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,379
tools but if you're in a position in a

98
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,120
limited budget uh you're on uh you know

99
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,858
you're if you're a medical patient like

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,319
myself you may not have a ton of money

101
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,478
to invest all at once and thousands of

102
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,579
dollars of equipment this is this is a

103
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,258
great option and way to go to get where

104
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,418
you need to start

105
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,199
um so the the garbage can is an option

106
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:37,139
you can work your way up to food grade

107
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,000
tubs and um and stainless steel is also

108
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,620
another great option as well too again

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,660
stainless steel is expensive but you can

110
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,918
go to

111
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,840
restaurant stores use restaurant stores

112
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,399
and and find equipment there as well too

113
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,239
for sale

114
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:54,060
um we're gonna need a Dull Knife uh or a

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,000
straight blade anything that has uh you

116
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,459
know a couple inches that you can use to

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,879
scrape a material off with this is a

118
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,099
ceramic blade not very sharp which is

119
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,259
great you don't want to cut the thing I

120
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,100
often like to use two so that when I do

121
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:13,919
scrape I can scrape off using that and

122
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,560
then also sometimes a large spoon is a

123
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,839
great option to help scoop out and or

124
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,540
shave off any of the stuff that you got

125
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,939
on your your knives

126
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,639
a pizza box is also going to be helpful

127
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:29,038
if you can access that or cardboard

128
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,259
pizza boxes are really easy to use

129
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,418
because they're convenient they have a

130
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,280
lid it keeps material out from getting

131
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:36,659
in

132
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,879
and the cardboard itself will help

133
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,960
absorb some of the water that is left

134
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,100
over in the bubble hash as it's drying

135
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,138
also I like to slip a little piece of

136
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,360
parchment paper in there you can label

137
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,538
it with the different screen sizes and

138
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,080
separate your your poles or your runs

139
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:58,918
according to the size of the

140
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,359
uh Micron of the screen and that helps

141
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,639
you kind of organize it to find out

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,800
which section maybe is the best for you

143
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,079
works the best for your application of

144
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,460
what you're looking to do these are

145
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,560
obviously readily available found at

146
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,659
your local pizza place uh you might have

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,060
to pay a couple bucks to grab them but

148
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,100
you can use them and they're easy to get

149
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,360
a hold of but like I said parchment

150
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,979
paper I like to use the unbleached brown

151
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,500
stuff

152
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,839
seems to work really well haven't had

153
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,538
any issues one of the other things that

154
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,459
we use is a frisbee you're probably

155
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:35,339
gonna look into a frisbee or a garbage

156
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,959
Clan lid depending on the size of the

157
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,459
material you're using so this is

158
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,439
something like this 20 gallon garbage

159
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:43,079
lid will help as well too if you're

160
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,819
using larger bags

161
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,099
um a pancake spatula so if you've ever

162
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,620
seen a pancake spatula before we don't

163
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,439
have one right now but basically it is a

164
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,139
spatula that has some holes in it and

165
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,459
that will help push material around or

166
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,079
flatten down material when you're

167
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,120
pushing it first putting it into the

168
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,199
machine

169
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,120
and then of course there's the Buckner

170
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,879
funnel and the freeze dryer so the

171
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,740
Buckner funnel you can go on a shaping

172
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,659
fire we have another video that uh the

173
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,879
we have two other videos that talk about

174
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,699
and walk through that use of that

175
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,860
technology and uh if you could afford

176
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,620
one freeze dryers are also a wonderful

177
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,900
option but again that's a multi-thousand

178
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,660
dollar investment and they also have a

179
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,279
tendency to malfunction

180
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,699
so and there's no real Insurance

181
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:33,500
programs on those so again this is kind

182
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:37,919
of approach to what hashmaking in a way

183
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,259
of basic uh utility and tools that you

184
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,258
may be able to find readily available in

185
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,240
any grocery store or any uh hardware

186
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,960
store near you

187
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,000
um

188
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,620
but maybe not the most like advanced

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,060
technology there are probably a ton of

190
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,160
other videos out there that can talk to

191
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,139
you about that but this is just going to

192
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,939
help you get started and get going and

193
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,800
get your get you processing your

194
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,199
material at home so that you can have

195
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,660
really high quality hash that you know

196
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,500
goes from Farm to Table

197
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:11,340
um or in our case Farm to bowl uh so uh

198
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:15,060
first of all we need to procure a set of

199
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:17,698
bags these bags were donated to us by

200
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,379
our friends over at the Press Club

201
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,478
um they do a wonderful job with all

202
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,539
different types of accessories or bags

203
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:26,399
and rosin so if you if you need anything

204
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,560
please go ahead and check out their

205
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,278
website which is the Press Club Press

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,320
Club dot Co again that's

207
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:36,958
thepressclub.com and you can find these

208
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,320
bags they are called The Press Club wash

209
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,478
bags they come in a variety of different

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,800
sizes and they come in a variety of

211
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,379
different

212
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:49,500
um amounts so you can buy one bag you

213
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:52,620
can buy a eight bags set and you can buy

214
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,139
I believe a three bag set as well too

215
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,539
um and so each bag has its own Micron

216
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,039
size starts at 220 and it goes down to

217
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,838
45.

218
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,338
um there's def other increments in the

219
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,620
in the middle too and those basically

220
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,720
separate the size of the trichome head

221
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,600
that the plant produces so when the

222
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,459
plant grows it produces trichomes they

223
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,000
don't all develop at the same time they

224
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:16,919
develop at different rates and so you

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,839
may have different size trichome heads

226
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,139
and they also are multiple different

227
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,640
types of trichomes so other trichomes

228
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,799
have smaller heads that will be removed

229
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,980
you have glandular trichomes Cecile

230
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,899
trichomes and sisal with tricon so we

231
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,639
want to avoid collecting cystolith

232
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,080
trichomes but we want the glandular

233
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,080
trichomes they're mostly what we're

234
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,259
trying to procure

235
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,240
so those bags are the essential part of

236
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:47,159
the component to what you're looking for

237
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:50,339
to make bubble hash the as of today are

238
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:55,860
shooting the video the eight bag set on

239
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:57,660
the Press Club site is uh 299 dollars so

240
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,100
uh a washing machine right let's say

241
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:01,799
roughly cost three or five hundred

242
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,600
dollars they're looking at 299 dollars

243
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,699
for that you're a few hundred dollars

244
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,500
investment already into this you want to

245
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,778
make sure that um

246
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,700
you you know you can utilize these tools

247
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:15,980
to the best uh

248
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,980
um best technology that you can

249
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,620
[Music]

250
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,620
um

251
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,679
so preferred material you use

252
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,299
we're going to start you could either do

253
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,579
fresh frozen or you could do dry

254
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,259
material fresh frozen is when you chop

255
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,778
the plant down at Harvest and you

256
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,899
immediately put it into a freezer and

257
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:38,399
you let that material freeze and then

258
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,740
you take it and you put it into the

259
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,200
machine and you start washing it it's a

260
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,019
really great way to capture mono

261
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,339
terpenes and other volatile organic

262
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:52,740
compounds that would evaporate or at

263
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,880
room temperature and you may not have in

264
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,039
a long term

265
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,019
Some people prefer this method uh

266
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,179
because of the quality of the end

267
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,278
product the end quality of them product

268
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:04,979
also has a different color it usually is

269
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,259
a little lighter in color and

270
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,000
um has a slightly different consistency

271
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:11,639
as well too

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,299
with dried material that's cured that

273
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:18,958
material will have a different flavor

274
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:20,639
profile it will also have a different

275
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,099
color to the end material it'll be

276
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,319
slightly darker as well too because the

277
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,320
trichomes develop over time and they

278
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,959
convert as well as the terpenes will

279
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,640
change over time Frenchy canole talks a

280
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,439
lot about this and I urge you to go out

281
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,740
there and look into the videos that he

282
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,440
has as well too because he's spoken a

283
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,940
lot about this uh recipes for entry we

284
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,740
uh we very much appreciate your

285
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,100
contributions to the uh the hash

286
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,100
community

287
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,039
um

288
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,200
so when you have dry material you're

289
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:56,159
going to be looking at somewhere maybe

290
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,240
between 10 to 15 percent return on your

291
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,059
um

292
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,379
your Harvest from the hash this is

293
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,059
dependent on the quality of the material

294
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,740
you use so the higher the quality of

295
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,679
material the better the hash that's

296
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,740
going to come out it's also important to

297
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:13,319
know that not every single plant washes

298
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,899
or runs through the machine and provides

299
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,240
an end quality product really well some

300
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,980
do much better than others I wrote an

301
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,860
article called breeding deceive on the

302
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,659
pressco website on their blog and it

303
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,200
really kind of gets more in depth into

304
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:29,819
what makes a good hash plan we've found

305
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,680
that some plants just really wash better

306
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,278
over and over and again they hold their

307
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,139
quality over longer than other plants

308
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,240
and you know it just has to be something

309
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,159
that you you do over time the more you

310
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,799
practice the better you're going to find

311
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,539
the nuances of this plant washes really

312
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,099
well because of this characteristic or

313
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,439
this plant doesn't wash so well because

314
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,019
it gets too sticky and the resin sticks

315
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,940
to the bag and you can't get it off so

316
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,019
there a lot of practices involved it's

317
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,459
like anything you want to get good at

318
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,078
anything you got to practice it and do

319
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,000
it over and over again so the same thing

320
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,458
goes with making hash the more practice

321
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,320
you have the more errors you'll make the

322
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,699
more you'll learn from those errors and

323
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,560
the more successes you'll have the more

324
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,000
you learn from those successes you'll

325
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,159
combine those two informations and

326
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,899
you'll be able to move on and really

327
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,819
make the best quality product you can

328
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,419
for yourself

329
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,700
so there also is this other way to

330
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,439
really kind of know before because you

331
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,480
don't want to maybe take your whole crop

332
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,639
and say let's wash it and you really get

333
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,339
a poor return you can do What's called

334
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,680
the jar Tech this is a simple method

335
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,779
where you take a mason jar fill it with

336
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,958
ice and water take about 10 grams of

337
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:39,360
flour at Harvest put it in there cap it

338
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,219
give it a good shake and wait a couple

339
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,919
seconds like shake it for 30 seconds

340
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,019
shake it for a minute and then let the

341
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,059
trichome heads fall to the bottom you'll

342
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,320
see the collection at the bottom and

343
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,539
again this is something that you'll have

344
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,180
to do over and over and over again to to

345
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,939
gauge what is good and what is average

346
00:13:54,179 --> 00:14:00,078
and what is below average

347
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:03,480
having the jar Tech really helps you

348
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:06,239
analyze what the plant is able to do and

349
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,579
give you when you have uh when you're

350
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,259
looking to procure a hash plant so the

351
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,939
jar Tech is a great option to really

352
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,480
kind of field test what you're doing

353
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,100
before you invest your whole crop into

354
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,959
washing and dumping it into a situation

355
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,820
where it just didn't return because it

356
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,679
just wasn't that type of plant or it was

357
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,600
it didn't come out the way you wanted to

358
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,138
do that time

359
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,820
um so definitely check into that

360
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:32,778
trichome development is super important

361
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:36,560
when you're looking to process material

362
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:39,480
you're really going to want to look into

363
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,278
the get what's called a loop or a

364
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,620
magnifying glass or something that can

365
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:47,100
let you look at the trichome head up

366
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,860
close and really see it over time if you

367
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,199
track during the last few weeks of your

368
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,480
plants growth and you watch those

369
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:55,979
tri-cat trichome heads expand they'll

370
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
get to a point where they'll stop

371
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,940
expanding and that's pretty much when

372
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,198
they're ready to that that's when the

373
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,199
the plant is pretty much ready to

374
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:07,319
harvest is when that bulbous head is at

375
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,939
its fullest potential you don't want to

376
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,879
go too far you want it that it's like

377
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,980
the top of the bell curve and a couple

378
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,259
people talk about this Frenchie can only

379
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,959
talked about this Swami talks about this

380
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,059
and this is when you shake a plant you

381
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,979
can smell it or when you walk past it

382
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,778
it's very vibrant in its smell and

383
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,879
that's because the trichome heads are

384
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:29,039
ripe and they're falling off and they're

385
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,600
opening and releasing the terpenes that

386
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,519
you can smell and the other volatile

387
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,820
organic compounds

388
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,740
so learning these techniques when you're

389
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,420
harvesting learning these techniques

390
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,459
when you're processing learning these

391
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:43,860
techniques when you go to wash all

392
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:46,919
really help to add up to an end quality

393
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,139
product that really just gives you

394
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,659
better material at the end again

395
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,360
practice practice practice

396
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,399
research practice and then you'll make

397
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,820
your applications and you'll refine them

398
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,198
and you'll end up really really really

399
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,660
enthused with what's what's happening at

400
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,399
the at the back end of the process

401
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:08,578
um

402
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:14,458
a lot of the a lot of the Harvest timing

403
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:17,819
and a lot of the processing is also very

404
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:21,000
individual to the person what I prefer

405
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,699
and what Shango likes and uh what other

406
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,919
people like is completely different I

407
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:27,599
might like something very lethargic and

408
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,698
so I like to let my plants go a little

409
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,399
bit longer Shango might like something

410
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,019
that's very uplifting and energetic so

411
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,339
he might like to harvest his plants a

412
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,259
little bit early or right in the middle

413
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:41,880
at the the high peak of moderation so

414
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:43,620
learning your plant is really important

415
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,240
and learning when you like to harvest

416
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,000
your plants is really important now

417
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,500
there are obviously conditions when you

418
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,899
have to chop and drop because of

419
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,720
environmental conditions law enforcement

420
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,820
whatever the reason being you may have

421
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,339
to adjust what you like to do to the

422
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,778
conditions around you but in general if

423
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,339
you're repeating the process every year

424
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:03,480
and you're you're only growing a few

425
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,939
plants at Home under your medical

426
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,338
license or under the legal state law us

427
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,199
then you can refine your process and

428
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:13,259
learn or you can acquire material from

429
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,140
other people and process that material

430
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:19,919
so learning your Harvest times learning

431
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:23,040
your plants learning what plants wash

432
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,459
really well all really help you advance

433
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,119
faster through the whole process

434
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,058
um

435
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,739
storing that material is also important

436
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:33,240
so the more you touch the more you

437
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,640
process the more it moves around the

438
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,919
more it bangs around it's going to bang

439
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,020
up the the plant material and it may

440
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,538
knock off the trichome head it may break

441
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,879
it open and open those volatile organic

442
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:45,720
compounds in the and the cannabinoids

443
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,559
into

444
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,259
um

445
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,879
uh into the onto the leaf surface so

446
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,339
they won't be able to be acquired

447
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,039
because when we wash and we sieve we're

448
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:58,558
trying to collect the trichome head as

449
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,779
an individual head and then collect a

450
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,819
lot of them and make sure that there

451
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:06,058
isn't any plant material or any any

452
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:09,480
other material that is left

453
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:11,279
so once we have all those things dialed

454
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,259
in and of course you know it takes time

455
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,579
to to practice this you're going to have

456
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,319
to go through some harvests and you're

457
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:18,839
going to have to figure out what you're

458
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,279
going to you know what works for you but

459
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,079
once you get all that down it's really

460
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,660
going to become more of like tying your

461
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,519
shoes and a walk-through process of

462
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,860
getting getting that end product so

463
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,440
starting out now with using the machine

464
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:33,959
we've already pre-loaded this machine

465
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,880
um because it's just easier so what you

466
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,759
would normally do is you would come in

467
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,140
you put a layer of ice at the bottom

468
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,240
cover it up

469
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,100
this machine can handle up to a thousand

470
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,919
grams of material you can use less

471
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:49,139
material just add less water and so if

472
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,538
you only have let's say 300 grams of

473
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,460
material you're going to use a little

474
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:55,619
bit less than half the machine so here

475
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,880
we don't have as much material today we

476
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,439
don't have a thousand grams that we're

477
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,900
gonna be putting into this machine so

478
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,058
we're using less water you can see the

479
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,740
the water

480
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:07,259
condensating on the outside here and not

481
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,019
up here so our water level stops here

482
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,619
with the ice and the water and

483
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,779
um

484
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,099
but we start here with the ice at the

485
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,440
bottom so you start with the ice layer

486
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,719
at the bottom that goes in and then you

487
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,640
layer your cannabis on the top of that

488
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,339
and then you layer another ice layer on

489
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,780
top of that as well too

490
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:26,220
now you don't have to do it this way you

491
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,660
can just put the ice in there you can

492
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,360
put the material in there and you can

493
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:34,080
just add water and and you can do it

494
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:36,119
that way but this kind of helps keep the

495
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,759
the ice on the top will help keep the

496
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,639
material down and help rehydrate it

497
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:44,579
while you're adding your water so that

498
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,820
it kind of moves through the machine a

499
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:49,798
lot easier and flows and the trichome

500
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:53,220
heads break off with the water

501
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:57,538
application as opposed to breaking off

502
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,940
of a mechanical operation from the ice

503
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:01,740
so there are different types of ice

504
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,058
cubes that you can use of course you

505
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,819
need to find what's readily available

506
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:08,220
for you if you have the space at home to

507
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,439
make your own ice you and you have

508
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,779
filter filters to filter your water to

509
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,460
do that it's really that's you know

510
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,339
great you can save a lot of money by

511
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,679
making your own ice and setting up and

512
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:22,139
you can quality control that aspect of

513
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,940
the the input one of the really

514
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,280
important things to remember when you

515
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,380
start using the ice in the water is you

516
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:32,460
want to make sure it's filtered you

517
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:35,000
don't want to use any water that is out

518
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,679
of the tap that you haven't tested

519
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,960
because there's heavy metals there can

520
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,460
be sulfur for instance on the island

521
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,919
here there's a lot of sulfur in the

522
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,798
water so we're unable to use that tap

523
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,259
water because it leaves a sulfur taste

524
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,779
in the end product and we want to try to

525
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:54,720
avoid that so ideally I'm using

526
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:57,058
distilled water or Ro filtered water or

527
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,440
even just regular filtered water I mean

528
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:00,298
if you wanted to you could use a British

529
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,519
there but you're gonna have to

530
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:04,079
do a lot of Brita filtering into other

531
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,379
containers to get the amount of water

532
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:10,319
that you need to do the wash but water

533
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,960
quality is super important ice water

534
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,700
quality is really important so when you

535
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
start making your ice the quality of the

536
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,179
water

537
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,700
going into that is super important you

538
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:23,280
always want to use distilled or RO water

539
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,038
if you can if you have access to it if

540
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,779
you don't get your well water tested and

541
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,700
see where it's at you know if it's not

542
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:32,099
high in Mineral content it's not high in

543
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,140
Sulfur or anything that has a distinct

544
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:36,298
smell or taste to it when you drink it

545
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,740
then go ahead and use it try and do a

546
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:39,779
couple runs and see what the hash comes

547
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,640
out like if it comes out okay then then

548
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:43,558
you know it's good if it doesn't then

549
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,460
you got to stick with procuring

550
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:49,019
distilled water or RO water

551
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,360
um so now that you have the ice in your

552
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:53,400
water your ice is layered your cannabis

553
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,439
is layered your ice is layered on top

554
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,780
you can add your water that water is

555
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,820
going to fill all the way up to the top

556
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,859
of the ice there and you're going to let

557
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:05,819
that material sit

558
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:08,519
um in this for probably anywhere between

559
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:11,220
15 to 30 minutes again that's dependent

560
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:14,579
on the the material how dry it is going

561
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,798
in if it's fresh frozen obviously it

562
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,418
doesn't need to sit in the water for 30

563
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,538
minutes because it's already full of

564
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:24,419
water and it's frozen and cold

565
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:26,158
so you can avoid that but for the most

566
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:29,659
times you're going to want to let the

567
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,659
plant sit and and

568
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,038
soak in the machine for roughly about 30

569
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,658
minutes

570
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,819
some people like to freeze the material

571
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:41,340
ahead of time that's awesome if you have

572
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:43,019
freezer space to do that it's not uh

573
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:45,720
imperative it does help the trichome

574
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:48,720
heads break off and it slow makes the

575
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,759
process of rehydrating and keeping it

576
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,659
cold faster

577
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,579
um

578
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,320
but it doesn't have to be done you can

579
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,119
just use room temperature flour it's

580
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,359
totally fine

581
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:04,859
um now the run time is also something

582
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:08,279
that is dependent on what you want to do

583
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:09,719
the plant material itself and how much

584
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:13,980
time you have

585
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:18,240
um you can run the plant the machine for

586
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,380
up to 10 minutes and just thrash

587
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,319
everything around and try and get

588
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,559
everything in one bout but we found that

589
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,480
if you run it in lesser increments you

590
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:28,319
can pull higher quality material out of

591
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,980
it

592
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,359
at a better rate so the most ripe

593
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,279
trichomes are going to fall off around

594
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,219
the first few times that you're doing

595
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,379
your first wash and the second wash so

596
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,600
the first wash you may may only want to

597
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,880
run for one minute or 30 seconds or

598
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,439
three minutes that's up to you it's

599
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,840
something that you need to to decide

600
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,019
what you want to do if you want the

601
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,819
super most ripe trichromes run it for a

602
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:55,440
minute see what comes out

603
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:57,240
running your second wash for three

604
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,880
minutes see what comes out and then

605
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,839
adapt from there and go on and try to

606
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,820
make your uh your Corrections that way

607
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:08,099
if you're looking for just getting more

608
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,960
food grade quality where you're you're

609
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:14,699
not smoking it and it's not super

610
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:17,700
important that it's very clean and uh

611
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,740
unadulterated with plant material then

612
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,179
go ahead and just run a longer wash on

613
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,460
your first few runs and try to get as

614
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:26,460
much material out of it as you can

615
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,079
again practice right find what works for

616
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,779
you in the situation that you're doing

617
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:33,599
for the thing that you want to do so

618
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,399
once you've acquired your bags uh to

619
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,199
wash with you're going to have your

620
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,000
garbage can here and you're gonna need

621
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,080
to layer them into the can

622
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,720
you're going to start with the lowest

623
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,359
bag the number 45 then you're going to

624
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,298
go up to your 73 then your 90

625
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,298
then you're going to go to your 120 160

626
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:54,000
uh

627
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:56,179
190 220 again however many bags you buy

628
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,679
is depending on how much you can afford

629
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,419
and what you want to run and then you

630
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,019
also find out which bags you want to use

631
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,020
over time

632
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,419
different bags will pull different

633
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,058
trichome heads and different plants

634
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,860
produce different size trichome heads so

635
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:15,000
again it's a practice kind of thing and

636
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:17,339
you'll have to go through a bunch of

637
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,538
different material to find out but once

638
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:20,279
you get your bags you're going to take

639
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:23,339
them like I said put the lowest number

640
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:25,859
at the bottom put that bag in first put

641
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:28,019
it around you'll have these little tie

642
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:31,379
things to come in here and cinch it in

643
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,599
and that will help keep it taut to the

644
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,260
the can when you run the water so it

645
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:39,480
doesn't pull the bag into the

646
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,798
um the whole can that would not be an

647
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,220
ideal situation

648
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,379
so here we take this put it in

649
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,700
also before you put your bags in here

650
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,159
you're going to want to pre-wash them go

651
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,720
ahead and just take a hose you can use

652
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,778
regular water for this it's not a huge

653
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,100
deal but just go ahead wash them out you

654
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:57,960
may want to kind of fold them up a

655
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,939
little bit put them in some water wash

656
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,980
them sometimes for manufacturing they

657
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,980
come with a couple loose threads so you

658
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,778
may get some fibers that come off you

659
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,000
know it's not a big deal get in there

660
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:11,640
wash them give them a little pre-wash go

661
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,400
ahead let them dry out and then go ahead

662
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,860
and put them in uh stacked with 45 at

663
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,440
the bottom some folks will use the 25

664
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:22,558
bag I'm not a big fan of the 25 bag

665
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,000
personally it's some it just it's not

666
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,220
worth it the material is not there it

667
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,140
doesn't it's not

668
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,700
my personal opinion is not worth it but

669
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,679
if you want to go ahead and use that low

670
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,538
of a bag that's cool

671
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,259
um use it see what it how it works for

672
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:38,519
you but yeah 25 45

673
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:39,720
73 so they all cut and different

674
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,220
companies make different size bag

675
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,538
numbers

676
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,100
um one of the things that you also want

677
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:47,278
to remember too when you buy your bags

678
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:50,579
is to match the diameter of the bag to

679
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:53,278
the opening of the container that you're

680
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:55,139
using so this container is a 20 gallon

681
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,900
container because these are specific 20

682
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,940
gallon bags that the presco makes

683
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,820
Fresco also makes them in five gallons

684
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,580
10 gallons you got the 20s here and they

685
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:07,859
go up the 30s as well too 33s

686
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:11,099
um other companies like the Bubble Bags

687
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:14,219
they're gonna have uh uh their biggest

688
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:18,178
bag I think is a 20 33 bag which works

689
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:21,600
in a 33 gallon container and for both 20

690
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:24,419
and 33 gallons size but the the Press

691
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:27,959
Club has made more specific bags for uh

692
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:31,020
different applications so again check

693
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,259
your bag size with the the website that

694
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:35,940
you order it from and check the size of

695
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:37,798
the container that you're using to make

696
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,058
sure they match not super inconvenient

697
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:40,619
to have to go out and buy another one

698
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,778
but you know it's an extra 25 bucks that

699
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,099
you don't have to spend so once you get

700
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:47,339
your bags here you're going to layer

701
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:49,859
them in I don't usually bring them under

702
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:52,139
the handle here because it stretches

703
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:54,479
them out you really don't want to

704
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:59,220
stretch or pull on the bags really hard

705
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,079
because it'll kind of move the they're

706
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,900
all in like a mesh form right so you

707
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,699
have squares tiny little squares

708
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,298
throughout the bag which is what is used

709
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,558
in the C evening process so if you

710
00:28:08,298 --> 00:28:14,158
tighten and loosen it changes the

711
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:16,259
diameter of the the hole in the bag and

712
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,140
so you want to kind of keep it loose and

713
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,460
but you also don't want it to fall in

714
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,179
when the water comes out of the machine

715
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,038
and and fills the bag so again there's a

716
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,778
practice curve there that you need to

717
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,298
learn and once you get that curved down

718
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:33,058
it becomes substantially easier

719
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:35,519
so that's kind of the end here that we

720
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:37,678
have for the uh putting the bags in and

721
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,619
we'll get back to making a run on the

722
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,820
machine here all right we're back and uh

723
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:45,019
we're just going to run over a few

724
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:48,119
things here before we uh come to the end

725
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:51,058
I didn't mention sprayers before and

726
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,979
sprayers are important part of kind of

727
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:54,538
collecting the hash after you've pulled

728
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,819
the bag you definitely want to get a

729
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:59,038
good sprayer you can use a hand sprayer

730
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,500
that you would you know like a hand pump

731
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,839
sprayer that would um you would maybe

732
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,579
use to use it for cleaning agents or

733
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,558
something like that that does work it

734
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,298
it's it's you know if if you have

735
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:10,158
arthritis it's not the option you want

736
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:13,558
to use

737
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,900
if you struggle with a repetitive motion

738
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,579
it's not the option you want to use but

739
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,320
again if you if it's the only thing you

740
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:21,480
can find in your area for the time you

741
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:24,000
can totally do that even if you can't

742
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,919
find a sprayer you can use a one gallon

743
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,319
jug put your couple fingers over the

744
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,820
hole and kind of just pour and let it

745
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,220
run around and push all the material

746
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,918
down that's going to be the most basic

747
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,419
way to do it you can step up to like a

748
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:38,038
pesticide sprayer so you could go to

749
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:40,380
Home Depot or you could go to Lowe's or

750
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:42,839
any hardware store and look for like a

751
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,419
10 gallon pestic Sprite spread excuse me

752
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,859
a 10 gallon pesticide sprayer

753
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,299
um again you're not going to want to

754
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:49,199
contaminate it with pesticide you're not

755
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:51,359
going to want to use it for Korean

756
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,278
natural farming inputs or jadam or

757
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,918
anything else label it with the words

758
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,079
hashmaking only put a label maker

759
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,259
sticker on it draw a star on it whatever

760
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,240
it is you got to do but basically only

761
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:05,158
use that for hashmaking so that it's not

762
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,960
contaminated with any other inputs or

763
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:08,580
anything like that

764
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,019
um that hand pump sprayer that you can

765
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,119
get from Home Depot it's like a 10

766
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,980
gallon hand pump sprayer it comes with a

767
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,658
wand that's a good option to use for

768
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,419
home it's cheap it's probably about 25

769
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:20,580
30 bucks at most and it's going to do a

770
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,960
decent job at getting the trichomes that

771
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:24,720
are stuck to the side of the walls of

772
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,460
the bag down to the bottom a lot of

773
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,480
people in the who are doing commercial

774
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:33,419
production like to use sump pumps in a

775
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:36,839
an exterior 30 gallon garbage can

776
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:39,720
that is then run through a hose

777
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:42,058
and uh you just end up using one of

778
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,740
these and then you spray down into the

779
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:46,019
the container and that really pushes

780
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,399
down we unfortunately are unable to use

781
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,740
this at the location we're at today

782
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,019
because the water is higher and sulfur

783
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,720
coming out of the tap so it would

784
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:57,658
contaminate our hash and kind of give it

785
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,120
that sulfurated flavor so we try to

786
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,620
avoid that and we just don't have the

787
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,859
setup to run the pump here at this time

788
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:08,038
so again this is a video designed

789
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:10,439
specifically for entry-level uh people

790
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:12,839
or those people who are in areas where

791
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,038
you just don't have resources to the

792
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:18,000
things that would make the perfect setup

793
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:20,158
sometimes you just got to do what you

794
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,480
got to do to get through to figure it

795
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,799
out and that's how it is so make sure

796
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,200
you have a really good sprayer that's

797
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,700
super important to help collect all the

798
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,880
trichomes it really will just get you

799
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,519
the maximum yield and return from

800
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,140
everything and you'll be able to to be

801
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,519
more satisfied with your end results on

802
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,778
that for just a very low input cost

803
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,119
a purchase

804
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:46,440
so yeah so once you pull the bags out

805
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,819
you're going to scrape them you're going

806
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,558
to collect everything put it on the

807
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,778
parchment paper put it on a drying

808
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:53,700
screen or put it in a pizza box or on a

809
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:55,319
piece of cardboard anything that's going

810
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,080
to kind of let the water move out of it

811
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,240
and and go

812
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,500
away from the hash so that it could dry

813
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,058
quickly

814
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,398
so you don't particularly want to heat

815
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:07,259
the hash that's going to really cause

816
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,359
some degradation you're going to lose

817
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,619
some terpenes that may convert some of

818
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:15,000
the cannabinoids if you're heating it

819
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:16,619
over time but yeah so basically look

820
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,398
into

821
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:20,038
um

822
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,658
when you pull out everything uh get it

823
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,759
onto the parchment paper get it on the

824
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:26,039
drying screen get it in front of a fan

825
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,919
or put it into the Bookner funnel and

826
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:30,599
use that to help remove the water out of

827
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,600
it or you can go ahead if you do have

828
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:36,359
the funds to to get a hold of a vacuum

829
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,538
up or a freeze dryer the freeze dryer

830
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:41,398
will be the best option to help you

831
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:42,839
remove the water as fast as possible and

832
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:44,339
get you the highest quality product at

833
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:45,240
the end

834
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:48,720
um

835
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,278
so now that you've got the uh process

836
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,140
set up and you're either going to choose

837
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,898
your air dry your Buckner funnel air dry

838
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,000
which is another air drying technique or

839
00:32:54,898 --> 00:33:01,579
the freeze dryer you're going to go into

840
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,538
storage once your hash is dry and you've

841
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,278
determined that it's ready to store

842
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:07,679
you're going to want to either put it

843
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,200
into a jar of some sort a glass jar with

844
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,179
a lid that can seal

845
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,940
and or put it into some cellophane tie

846
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:16,259
it up into a little ball and tighten it

847
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:19,019
basically you want to keep air and

848
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:22,879
moisture out and some folks will even

849
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:26,278
put in some of those

850
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,960
uh moisture transfer packs those will go

851
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:29,640
in there they work sometimes if you want

852
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,079
to use those as well I think they impart

853
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,000
a personally I think they impart a

854
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,699
flavor onto the the material when you

855
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,140
use them I avoid them but that doesn't

856
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,460
mean that other people don't like to use

857
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,340
them and they're not successful with

858
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,880
them they are in their eyes and that's

859
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,879
totally cool

860
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,820
all right so some final thoughts here on

861
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:34,079
the end of our day making hash

862
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,539
I just want to make sure that everybody

863
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,819
knows that this process is kind of a

864
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:41,759
golden gold out process and that means

865
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:44,220
using really high quality material will

866
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,740
yield you really high quality hash as

867
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:49,079
long as you do a good job receiving it

868
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,579
so so if you start with lower quality

869
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:53,159
material you're going to definitely end

870
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,679
up with a lower quality end product but

871
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,740
that's the whole goal is get better at

872
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,900
growing or get better at sourcing better

873
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:03,959
material and then you will also probably

874
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,760
get better at receiving hash over time

875
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,039
because it'll be easier your results

876
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,200
will be better and you'll feel better

877
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,900
about what you're actually doing so

878
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,939
that's really important and be patient

879
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,460
about what you're doing it is a long

880
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,159
monotonous process that you have to be

881
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,139
repetitive over and over again if you're

882
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,139
only growing once a year then maybe it

883
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:27,358
is only once a year outdoor material

884
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:28,920
that you're using you're only going to

885
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,078
be maybe making hash once or twice a

886
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,159
year then so if not if you're going

887
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,599
indoors you're going to have more

888
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,879
practice or if you have the ability to

889
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,920
grow Auto flowers Outdoors you can use

890
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,500
those to practice with too that will

891
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,559
just help refine your Technique to get

892
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,039
better for the full terms or the indoor

893
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:49,920
or whatever it is you're deciding to do

894
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:51,059
with your your production method also if

895
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,039
you're looking for more information

896
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:56,539
about how to do this because this is a

897
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:59,099
very casual visual video and

898
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:01,259
kind of just getting you the basics of

899
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,660
what's going on go on to social media

900
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,980
sites like Instagram or Facebook take a

901
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,199
look at people out there there's a bunch

902
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,659
of people obviously Frenchie cannoli

903
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:12,598
rest in peace Frenchie he was one of the

904
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:14,519
best housemakers in the world and he you

905
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:18,539
know has a ton of information on his

906
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:21,300
Instagram page his wife Madame cannoli

907
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:24,059
and his Apprentice cherry blossom Bell

908
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,099
are also putting on classes all over the

909
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,320
United States they were just did a class

910
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:30,240
in California and

911
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,539
um and so they're a great resource as

912
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,519
well too to pass on the tradition of

913
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,500
hashish making and Temple ball

914
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,679
production there's also other people

915
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,679
like jendo she's an amazing hashmaker

916
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,719
she's up in the Northeast and she is

917
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,699
will answer your questions and help you

918
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,858
get on the right Pathway to being better

919
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:52,039
hash resin Ranch in California is

920
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:54,179
another great person to take a look at

921
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:56,519
there's a variety of people out there

922
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:58,679
but also be respectful because gendo and

923
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,719
resin Ranch will just likely quickly

924
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:03,598
tell you to [ __ ] off if you are being

925
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,559
very impolite or pushy remember these

926
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,119
people have thousands of people

927
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:07,980
following them and they can't get to

928
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,960
every single question every day but if

929
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,880
you're patient and you wait or if you go

930
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,380
through their Scrolls and watch go

931
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,660
through their posts and you go through

932
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,220
their timelines you can find the bits

933
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:19,920
and pieces of information that they they

934
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:22,559
give out for free and and you'll be able

935
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,599
to be more successful faster in your

936
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:27,539
production in your hashmaking so be

937
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,820
respectful be patient and have a good

938
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:31,380
time and as far as making all the hash

939
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,300
because that's the real end goal is to

940
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,820
enjoy what you're doing make a great

941
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,260
hash product and and then enjoy that

942
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,838
when you're when you're finished with it

943
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,700
so if you have any other questions throw

944
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,159
them down in the uh the comment section

945
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:46,679
there I'll do my best to jump on and

946
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,779
answer them when I can I appreciate you

in a video get to help you get off the

949
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,319
ground and get started my name is Tyler

Marquardt and hope to see you smoke some

951
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,820
hash with you sometime soon cheers
