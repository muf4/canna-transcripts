1
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:22,439
when I first interviewed Kevin on my

2
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,689
shaping fire podcast he said

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,019
with zero shame that he has been a

4
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,649
trapper her all his life I thought that

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:34,350
was so not only do I not hear many

6
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:36,869
people use the word trafficker but to

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,489
see someone who stepped into it and own

8
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,049
it and was proud of it and wrote a

9
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:41,929
prohibition all the way to legalization

10
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:45,268
and it is now a leader in his community

11
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm like damn straight these are the

12
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:50,429
kinds of things that make a hero to me

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,368
he has deep roots in both Oakland and in

14
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,210
Mobile County he is probative

15
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:56,640
prohibition-era

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,969
turned license and he's savvy and

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,189
successful in both he's created the most

18
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,019
important genetics hub in the United

19
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,618
States and the mult County at his

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,659
nursery Wonderland nursery not only is

21
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,790
he wildly successful himself but has

22
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,000
become a leader in that community you

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,520
know it's one thing to be a producer and

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,159
sell your products and just generally be

25
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,890
a good person but then to take that and

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,859
to become a leader in your community ban

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,230
people together work with policy changes

28
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:31,439
work with the laws and then go and

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,020
mentor new entrepreneurs new breeders

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,250
who are coming up and to fill the vacuum

31
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:40,619
that he's created behind him so that so

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,879
that there's new folks that kind of

33
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,560
leadership is rare in our industry if

34
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,890
somebody was not just trying to chase

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,109
dollars he's an all-around good guy and

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:57,170
I consider it a privilege to be his

37
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:57,170
friend my honor to present Kevin

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,270
there's so much for having me here I was

39
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,039
excited I follow what you guys doing

40
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,739
it's awesome that you as a community get

41
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,169
together in and work on Kenneth and and

42
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,769
cultural stuff and in community it's

43
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:25,469
it's I would say a losing element in our

44
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:27,959
society we're really we're becoming very

45
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,300
small man I really correct cultivators

46
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,370
spiritual cultivators so thank you so

47
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,080
much but let me come here um my

48
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,090
conversations typically are on that

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,380
though typically people reman to talk

50
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:43,080
about a direction a thing my success is

51
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,848
in survival I have successfully been in

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,580
cannabis since I was 12 years old and

53
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:54,089
I've had this unbelievably long storied

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,280
life of cannabis but here it is very

55
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,170
different time period where all of a

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,449
sudden cannabis is normally cannabis

57
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,458
tennis became business cannabis is the

58
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:04,530
culture and we have the pride but the

59
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,819
product is a business and this is this

60
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,560
is this discussion that I'm going to

61
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,479
have tonight it's when I talk about

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,509
turkeys in a little different manner

63
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,298
because you've had Ethan Russo speak to

64
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,548
you who is Iraq considered above the

65
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,760
state of the art of the subject right

66
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,219
now

67
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,620
then you had been Alexander here who's a

68
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:24,750
brilliant young man who is very

69
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,789
intelligent in plant derived hurts

70
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,189
solvent assignment so that's not my

71
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:31,078
direction my direction primarily is in

72
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:33,099
to assist people with genetic packaging

73
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,810
meaning I

74
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,299
the right varieties so that your

75
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,189
farmville business succeeds my

76
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,439
interpretation of the business is what's

77
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:42,879
accurate I have a tremendous number of

78
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,469
people I deal with they're brilliant

79
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,599
scientists and brilliant

80
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,830
that's what they do so people get

81
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,229
confused they want to ask me about a

82
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,060
hospital yeah that's not lady dude I got

83
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:54,099
to sell the atom I'm gonna tell you

84
00:03:52,060 --> 00:04:13,090
we're flying the atom I tell you how

85
00:03:54,099 --> 00:04:14,680
yeah so this conversation it became a

86
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,509
business we're not talking about get a

87
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,360
friendly conversation it was another

88
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:21,789
therapy apart it's not is your canvas

89
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,379
selling and people have this huge

90
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,720
misconception of how terpene is

91
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:27,639
interrelate with that of that and I

92
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,640
think that that had to be more important

93
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,829
than how we determine hi because you've

94
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,750
got a lot to existing you know and you

95
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:37,240
have to read a damn thing if you didn't

96
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,279
want to there's so much genetic material

97
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,470
available right now that if you just

98
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,329
went into it and took a look you say hey

99
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,520
I have enough to cover all my rights

100
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:47,370
now the question

101
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,930
optimizing for what you do and so this

102
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,990
conversations going to start with me

103
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,209
being a kid breaking up fails and

104
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,710
landrace cannabis so when I was a kid on

105
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,719
the East Coast I was involved in a

106
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:00,478
criminal family that was large this was

107
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,940
under the mexicanrunner travelers and as

108
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,068
you'll die I got to access all this ball

109
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,228
cannabis coming in from the chefs and

110
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:09,960
what it did was it allowed me to get I

111
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:12,478
want to say a reference point of what

112
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,038
cannabis was from its original origin so

113
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,050
it would come from these countries and

114
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,550
this was all pretty documented meaning

115
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,710
that was organized distribution

116
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,870
organized delivery and so it's about the

117
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,969
course of the year the loans would come

118
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,978
in and we would break these up and then

119
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,389
BAM and move around so he would start to

120
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:29,250
know hey this was Colombian and

121
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,460
Panamanian and this was Thai and this

122
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,319
was stuff from a family when we grew out

123
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:37,129
some of those Afghani seeds one year

124
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:41,848
maybe 7912

125
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:43,110
quite a case in 93 ended time so in 1790

126
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:44,728
girl goes out and the seeds in my

127
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,770
grandmother's jar and she had a stunning

128
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:48,180
organic garden and so we're able to put

129
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:51,448
the seeds into this beautiful fertile

130
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,889
blowing whistle and we finished down and

131
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:56,430
I heard it was smoke and I remember

132
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:59,908
being so caught up with how rich it was

133
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,379
but how different it was because of that

134
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,120
that was the first poppy grow this is

135
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,129
going back to you know the settings and

136
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,709
so I couldn't believe what those seeds

137
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:09,550
are translated into they have didn't say

138
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:12,279
where it's definitely an easy

139
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,800
a lot of flowers from the bags but we

140
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,899
grew them in variety and all of a sudden

141
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
of smoke and the progeny four pounds

142
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:20,228
that would be able to you know what's

143
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,239
the saying to this and I can taste the

144
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:25,538
similarities but there's something

145
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,860
missing and something added and so I

146
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,180
just remember this I don't leave my

147
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,000
goodness this is just something that

148
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,709
makes me strong and what I do categorize

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,500
stuff mentally trash people not to

150
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:38,739
others so I remember those so I go for

151
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:43,060
me and Bailey need to use and then I go

152
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,310
into the military and when I went into

153
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,649
the military this was during the high of

154
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,449
the drug war I was a salvage divers and

155
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,948
I just get dropped on helicopters under

156
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,930
boats filled with billions of dollars in

157
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:55,870
profits in the Pacific and we diagram

158
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,300
investors and I started to be back on

159
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,399
the ships with all the land raised hot

160
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,189
again and I started to see and smell

161
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,799
walls and I started just starting to

162
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,899
categorize and I started to see the

163
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,598
cannabis that was being produced in

164
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:12,489
California this would have been the mid

165
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,468
80s and I started to see California

166
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,960
cannabis I started to see all these

167
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:19,089
profiles and laboratory profiles and

168
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,680
tastes and tones and at that time we

169
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:22,448
cannabis was with cannabis and it came

170
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,728
in a million arrays but it's all

171
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,319
classified basically as good time to

172
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:27,490
thank choice for that but it didn't make

173
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,949
a difference to lose the food products

174
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,050
move on and you started to see this more

175
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,610
than any California up in a non cattle

176
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,370
that would have been you know it

177
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,470
aids-related later I started to really

178
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,180
see flavonoids come and I said

179
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,720
everything tastes the same it was

180
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,189
because of that and so we started as

181
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,770
soon as all the sudden that want to

182
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:51,350
change the entire tone about manners all

183
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:53,479
this leg one so people will leave the

184
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,070
canvas space like what people believe we

185
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,710
can this tastes like Afghanistan many

186
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:02,209
people around the where I started to see

187
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:04,789
was the impact of what's on your tennis

188
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:06,649
tennis itself so I started doing all

189
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,569
this this consulting and humble was a

190
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,879
legal consultant but it was the only way

191
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:12,349
you can see any other quantity is to be

192
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,519
able to really work with a lot these new

193
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:19,550
max of operations one tremendous variety

194
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,740
of strains within their operations and I

195
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,389
would then be able to employ any type of

196
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,810
variety I wanted any one of these

197
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:29,000
operations and by changing and input I

198
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:32,090
would change how we perceive that

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,408
strained of it and so what we do again

200
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,680
down to is that when you're talking

201
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:38,779
about a profile of turkeys everything

202
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,120
what influences it so when someone says

203
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:44,179
to you I have a terpene profile I was

204
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,350
asking what what not the Candice because

205
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,379
the influence you're not able to

206
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,029
separate from and so it's such a big

207
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:51,769
deal that when I'm doing something like

208
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,750
the Emerald cup is a judge where I judge

209
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:56,149
them right there are thousand sins

210
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,450
I take a pen and I know things that

211
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:01,730
taste exceptionally similar and I keep

212
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,320
track of those of those samples and at

213
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,000
the end of the cup I go back and they

214
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,100
usually from the same Congo suppliers

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,960
and so what we found was the Kampala

216
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,300
suppliers on Sonoma using the great

217
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,519
waste had a much higher residual sugar

218
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:16,429
load which brought up which brought up a

219
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,019
flavonoid profile in the Kansas Turpin

220
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,629
ativ things like this they drive these

221
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,639
numbers

222
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:24,450
a higher overall number does that

223
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,759
necessarily be it's better and when I'm

224
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,680
Ben and I had a discussion in Hollywood

225
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,679
wants to know I brought up his paper to

226
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,819
show and it was a term profile

227
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,549
strawberry-banana thought that I had and

228
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,670
it came out in California seems about 5%

229
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:40,199
is tops or again goes up to 15 but we

230
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:44,059
must quantify differently because where

231
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,060
this process of three times California

232
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:54,389
is considered a really hot straight turn

233
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,430
to live I have two point five strawberry

234
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:58,919
that's happiness number that if you look

235
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,750
at profiles women throw their way but

236
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,029
the problem is it sells to $1,000 a

237
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,149
pound because it makes an exceptionally

238
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,129
immunity concentrate so I shared it to

239
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:22,559
bed Cindy goes in lab because turn

240
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:26,309
people say that has no value so many

241
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,619
projects I had so many that I had

242
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:30,899
learned how to use a computer

243
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,120
spreadsheet I remember all this [ __ ]

244
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,449
what it did was it let me start to see

245
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,340
what was the impact of any flavor on the

246
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,320
cannabis and what was the impact on the

247
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,940
environment then it started to take a

248
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,250
little deeper and I started going you

249
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,500
know what this train was a killer while

250
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,110
it was grown and produced and sifted

251
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,409
loose if it's the keyword under metal

252
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,350
halide and this particular cutting

253
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:57,259
sifted under HPS that means of the

254
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,240
whoever threw it well found it they

255
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:01,789
found something that was developed in a

256
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,740
specific environment like a specific

257
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:06,409
nutrient in a specific environmental

258
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,778
situation and all those things

259
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:11,838
contribute rapidly to how you received

260
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:14,000
herpes it has put you back to the point

261
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,040
where it's so big that I don't think

262
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,750
people need to see it it's so big

263
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,278
they just look at this is this and this

264
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,980
is my list and look at my numbers my

265
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,838
numbers of big but the problem is you're

266
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,579
looking at terms and you look at a 40

267
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,769
maybe I think there's like 240 in

268
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:30,078
cannabis Ben has a lab in in Illinois

269
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,669
from the vet that came in he has a lab

270
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,899
in Illinois that he can access and

271
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:34,578
whether to start sending all these

272
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,970
varieties for this lab is we want to

273
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:40,849
find out why do I have a common copy

274
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,370
right now we only can see a specific

275
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,050
amount it's the missing pieces that

276
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,929
matter so we can take a look a better

277
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:49,818
idea what is this in this situation

278
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:53,028
produced here it has this particular

279
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:55,399
value you can produce it someplace else

280
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:56,838
and transfer the ballot and see that's

281
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,269
the part that's tough for most people

282
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,130
because cannabis producers you get

283
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,379
things from people and you say hey this

284
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:05,509
was awesome of you but you take it into

285
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:07,338
an environment and when you put it into

286
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,289
your environment you're a web browser so

287
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,870
you have exceptional lighting except

288
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:13,789
what cool and so you have an ability to

289
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,948
do some different stuff but it changes

290
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:18,948
the plan on a county level and it

291
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:21,469
reflects in a certain role we choose

292
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:22,849
those plants and we put into a GPS room

293
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,730
and all of a sudden all the monitors

294
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,459
smoothly right off and because it wasn't

295
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,529
in a hot room when you chosen and so the

296
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,529
profit people

297
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:34,809
it's such an understanding of I'm just

298
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,179
producing pot because for most people

299
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,379
they're really not dealers some people

300
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,779
ask me what I know they're drug dealer

301
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:45,210
what happens to love growing pot it's

302
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:49,769
alright genetics

303
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,769
who owns dispensaries

304
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,889
the other day I said listen you can

305
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,860
understand in abundance triple-a market

306
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:15,250
which is visual it's gonna always be a

307
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:18,399
monetary market there's no time don't

308
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,009
spoken in some forms it's little tiny

309
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,319
pieces so they can put all the heat on

310
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:26,169
and one time and get all my models and

311
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,420
cemeteries and go it's complete but if

312
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:30,459
that triple-a visual piece with that

313
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:33,399
bass goes into someone who spoke

314
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,200
civilian form by the second head all the

315
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,179
model terms have flared off because the

316
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,680
heat that moves through the junk so I

317
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:40,629
started telling all that if you put into

318
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,359
a pre-roll market its assets paternity

319
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:46,509
market and if you've gone into into this

320
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,220
market it's a model market have to see

321
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,720
it that way because they don't care

322
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,120
about the flavor as much as they care

323
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,710
about the nose and the visual drug

324
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,810
smugglers wanted in the mouth and you

325
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,089
you have to take a look and say well

326
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,939
then what lines work with that we take

327
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,580
stuff like right now the best

328
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,990
think of is the old herbal cut because

329
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,840
the old herbal kind is really a

330
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,299
descendant of everything for a bush

331
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,430
purple kush to mend over or whatever you

332
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,500
want to call it into every other modern

333
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:16,319
hot strain right now where the Girl

334
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,429
Scout cookie that's this cherry pie all

335
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,770
of that is to better

336
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:21,539
why is that all of those strings are

337
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:23,909
primarily sold to people smoking in

338
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:25,709
Portal and it's because of the way that

339
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:27,809
that plant has an ability to hold a

340
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,240
suspect our being that doesn't burn off

341
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:32,789
but releases this plentiful flavor in

342
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,620
your mouth all time and so for people

343
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,329
were in the pre-roll market we need to

344
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,409
look into those directions and if you're

345
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,050
not you need to look at the other

346
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:42,839
direction I think that most individuals

347
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:45,120
really unaware of their impact with what

348
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,460
you're doing to their their life just

349
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,679
like I use the example of Rakesh so I

350
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,350
have a very specific royal push push was

351
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,809
a line created in humble by a man named

352
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,370
Ann Laura so in a broccoli reader he

353
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:57,689
passed away but about a year and a half

354
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,789
two years ago footba sudden heart attack

355
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,340
like there were seven his nose so bright

356
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:04,079
passes away but he does did reading

357
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,410
project boy because but he does the

358
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,990
essay on three thousand plants on the

359
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:12,059
coast so his search was up three

360
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,220
thousand progeny puts out three thousand

361
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,409
and he doesn't mean how to be another

362
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,540
man Noah coast and he selects this one

363
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:20,669
incredible color so I hope this car it

364
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,500
gives it to me I hold it we use it to

365
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:25,409
propagate we sell it as a cutting and

366
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,870
it's the basis of every royal fish plant

367
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:29,819
now because window got busted I kept

368
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,350
that cut and hid it and when he came

369
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,830
back into the world I gave it back to

370
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:37,139
him and the whole line continued it's a

371
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,370
top five in the you see where every time

372
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,340
it's entered into the animal called

373
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,289
anything unconscious

374
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,350
Kampai because it's just such a unique

375
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:45,969
terpenes signature so we go guy this is

376
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,800
incredible and it's got such a

377
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,450
resistance it's all these traits of a

378
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,109
phenomena so we just didn't love with

379
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,230
this pretty planet

380
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,539
well indoor same things it's coming well

381
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,480
I've transferred in a camp on a hotter

382
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,889
drier environment and lo and behold my

383
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,279
studying royal cushion is pretty good

384
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:06,009
because it had been sifted in an

385
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,439
environment that is clean so you are

386
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:09,789
sifting the way you're producing and so

387
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,090
for people that are producing in hi

388
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:14,769
Robin it's exceptionally windy those

389
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,540
type of situations you're going to get

390
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:18,699
less production but those in your

391
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:20,589
varietals but you have happen is what

392
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,080
was happening to the waxes in the plant

393
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:25,180
it literally actually some of your model

394
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,580
services so when you see this hi

395
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:29,769
circulatory window research plant under

396
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,840
the same circumstances some of those

397
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:34,120
things allow you to have a radically

398
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:39,780
different response to the cannabis so I

399
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:43,120
take remember the nursery nursery

400
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:44,799
thousand gardeners across the state so

401
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,529
you can is different than most people

402
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,809
because I look at it in hundred fifty to

403
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,459
two hundred million dollars like your

404
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,259
range of production now I'm not making

405
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,389
that money for brows I don't my fingers

406
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,399
on that reduction nominal and so that

407
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,319
lets me see what really happens and let

408
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,269
me see the pulses of these things and

409
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,010
it's crucial because otherwise how we're

410
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,289
gonna know that's all right I've been

411
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,700
really accurate with it but it's little

412
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:08,619
things like the Royal cushion the wrong

413
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,779
circumstance and so they were able to do

414
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,979
well with it but not to the degree they

415
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,230
would have it be put it back to its

416
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,890
colder environment you wouldn't run it

417
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,930
in norm

418
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,530
we have to be careful with light depth

419
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,390
strains so when I simple

420
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:23,369
like that this way you're going to go

421
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,699
through an artificially high temperature

422
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:29,519
in me to where what you taught that [ __ ]

423
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,900
it's spice and anybody that's done you

424
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,799
know standard operating houses you've

425
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,490
got you're gonna have two million a

426
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,289
greenhouse

427
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,059
this isn't beautiful but if you're not a

428
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,829
guy you're gonna have spicy

429
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,210
humidity and temperature and you need to

430
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:41,099
make sure the varieties that you're

431
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,289
using are not primarily for definitely

432
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,939
serve your purposes so you don't

433
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:47,549
remember there was every variety that

434
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,130
you mess around was sifted from indoor

435
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:53,430
work so all the seed lines I've worked

436
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,260
with all under HBS so that's what I'm

437
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,890
saying I don't know the impact of what I

438
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:00,059
did I transfer that plant from HBS and

439
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,950
the other brother what if I get a

440
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:05,190
radically different morphology the plant

441
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:08,220
changes shape dramatically I sift for

442
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,170
outdoor normally it precludes the enjoy

443
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,670
it every now and then strange the touch

444
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,519
that means that it works in both

445
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,860
directions but sometimes it doesn't and

446
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,450
that's just the way it is so you know if

447
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,419
you're if your tennis producer if you

448
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,230
say

449
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,410
you want to make sure that you're

450
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,819
sifting stop that works in your specific

451
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,430
circumstance and using the foods that

452
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:32,250
you're using because that's reproduction

453
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,380
methodology if it will influence what

454
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,079
you're choosing what you find what works

455
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,250
for you in that specific and if you're

456
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,899
not good at this part

457
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,400
you go get people that run dispensaries

458
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,009
successful once again absolutely

459
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,850
position myself straight up they got us

460
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:49,680
out just didn't get wet no yeah I might

461
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:54,419
once whatever again you need those

462
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,950
answers and understand so we're clear on

463
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,140
that the imports that are coming into

464
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,090
this are so big that I don't think

465
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,800
anybody has any idea really what surfing

466
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:04,289
profile that plant asperity you've grown

467
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,629
that goddamn thing Spacey mundo well

468
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,460
you're not and all I see is these

469
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,290
notices so you know Nina brought that I

470
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,059
still have you I wanna see I still got

471
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:14,159
the original paper well then that still

472
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,539
pop down right over the university and

473
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,130
say hey I have a new relationship with

474
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,470
Bill with the University of California

475
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,820
I say hey send you over to your sites to

476
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,049
bother I want to talk to your professors

477
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:26,789
I said can we met by attorneys by the

478
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:29,129
famine bread so we can start figuring

479
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:32,009
out straight not only use fibers but I

480
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:35,150
was trying to figure out a way to what's

481
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,150
not what because

482
00:19:38,220 --> 00:20:46,990
so explain to me the fundamentals so

483
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,340
that I don't make mistakes so write it

484
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,710
as I said let's take a look at Canada is

485
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:51,189
a simple body so I broke it up into four

486
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,400
face

487
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,519
categories I wrote it up tools content

488
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,320
arts and fruits and waters because to me

489
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,759
as a distributor so on the motion we

490
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:04,419
vide is that basically covers the

491
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:06,450
spectrum the way let us kind of break it

492
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:17,860
up is basically like you're seeing

493
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:22,809
propylene limonene I mean because I buy

494
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:25,629
right where the problem is and essential

495
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,769
oil tech so burn that [ __ ] show me one

496
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,450
essay that says what happened when

497
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:31,180
you've earned it probably prison so

498
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,220
therefore you use in data that isn't

499
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,019
accurate and you're pretending like it

500
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,250
is and you're running wild liquor I

501
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,700
forget you're a genius

502
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,829
and I'm like look we need art meant but

503
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,630
not in the perception which means there

504
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:45,339
must be a precursor term somewhere

505
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,720
that's affecting it something to the

506
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:49,788
increase in it

507
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,409
let's see any of this crap so I broke it

508
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,980
up into four divisions to make easy for

509
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,809
myself

510
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,970
lo and behold I create a competition and

511
00:21:53,808 --> 00:21:57,499
use those four divisions the next thing

512
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,379
I know I've got a guy named Johnny Bruce

513
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:02,358
who's at UCLA brilliant professor one

514
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:03,829
challenge is my search because what made

515
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:16,759
you do that I said it makes sense to me

516
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:18,019
because you sell they will fire disaster

517
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:24,019
go prove me wrong

518
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:25,038
oh it was I was writing all this up so

519
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:26,628
if you want to have the guidance again

520
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,148
you can pull all this paper so it's a

521
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:31,278
thirty or forty page PC did I get a

522
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:33,768
six-hour medical conference in Vegas on

523
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,509
this topic because it was the first time

524
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:38,089
they had enough samples put together

525
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:40,460
that let them will get terpene profiles

526
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:43,128
and using crafting technology was pretty

527
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:46,038
neat I've done deceiving technology that

528
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:49,998
let me see visually shirts to see

529
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:51,378
relationships and so he showed me this

530
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:53,269
incredible interrelationships that

531
00:22:51,378 --> 00:22:57,128
basically kept training and limonene

532
00:22:53,269 --> 00:23:00,169
which is rules earth subsets through

533
00:22:57,128 --> 00:23:02,388
floral subsets and so he goes you were

534
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:04,759
completely right in your simplified rate

535
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:07,189
down and so the planet isn't the same

536
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:10,489
and I'm so damn smart instead if I

537
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,889
simplify 42,000 in the form then maybe

538
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:14,538
you can't do and it makes it kind of

539
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:17,209
easy because we can take a look at those

540
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:19,819
markets now it's a fuel market from a

541
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:22,340
market floral market earth market where

542
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:25,069
those markets exist and where's my

543
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:27,168
distribution in those markets and so I

544
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:28,849
know that if I'm in if under certain

545
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,730
situations I know that it sort of

546
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:32,308
happened

547
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,110
the floor which is dreaming in in this

548
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:34,648
area and someone says never losing isn't

549
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:38,668
funny

550
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:40,829
which one which mean a dream is like 9

551
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:43,080
or 10 different ones I have two of them

552
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:45,329
one of them would qualify under a fruit

553
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:49,109
flavor who one would go under a floor

554
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:51,210
because it goes more amazed so which one

555
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:53,939
you have to be honest individual because

556
00:23:51,210 --> 00:24:01,919
we can't go by out of line and even if

557
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:08,970
you mentor a specific cutting is so

558
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:14,509
crucial because so I produce pho it

559
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:16,980
sells 120 watts of Graham that's how

560
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:19,379
you'll like holy [ __ ] because otherwise

561
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,230
we're gonna get a point out so I love

562
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,909
the specific things and we do tests and

563
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,089
we find out that's the one that people

564
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:29,370
like then I can do anything I want any

565
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:31,168
pissed I want on because it's not gonna

566
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:33,119
give me the goddamn picture so you can

567
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:35,580
snap shot to a keyhole and I said wow

568
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,879
emails to people is a Fisher I know

569
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:42,148
normally so my perception is so accurate

570
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,190
that it completely negates my choices

571
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,869
because I'm not making choices I'm just

572
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,320
doing something that doesn't make any

573
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:47,719
sense

574
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,668
and

575
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,710
me it's crucial that you go about this

576
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:54,139
have to pick the right varieties for the

577
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,600
application for your purposes and so I

578
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:58,719
know what I do for my own situation

579
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,219
where I I break up those four categories

580
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,319
take a look at these subsets and I say

581
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,899
hey how much of a distribution does my

582
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:08,808
arm have to have in these respective

583
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:10,729
areas where do people like earths that's

584
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:12,950
a segment then where are you seen where

585
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,808
you see the fruits happy uplifted people

586
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,909
necessarily going into cartridges now

587
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:19,638
because it's going into women older

588
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:22,070
people changing where's the gas anybody

589
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:24,168
that has over Italy because opiate

590
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:25,788
addiction America's on control and well

591
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:30,320
he hasn't I've been running businesses I

592
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:36,589
asked my mom why by the way my coach I

593
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:41,569
hope your problem happens with Opie's I

594
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:43,730
don't know beans sir can this varietals

595
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:46,220
how to really be exceptionally effective

596
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,899
another replacing and so if you're in

597
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,210
California everybody's drugged up in

598
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:53,569
mind that Samuels because no one is

599
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,519
gonna get any effect but how do you use

600
00:25:53,569 --> 00:26:01,980
the fruit to drive

601
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:05,289
specifically this is just straight up

602
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:08,079
but what's the point of that I want to

603
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:10,839
teach you free we want to buy twice

604
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,519
right you just fall where it is I don't

605
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,500
once but I might rely so when you buy to

606
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,700
us go on through I want you to chase the

607
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,279
state of California

608
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,140
to buy all of that extra a lot of state

609
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:22,420
that me up because if people buy the

610
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,340
only price in all the way that's the bad

611
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,259
thing so how do we do that

612
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:30,129
look for these things that work for us

613
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:31,289
we start to be intelligent about so if

614
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,000
you ever then go into the pet market

615
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:36,190
then those of those rights are beans

616
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,779
those things go that direction but if

617
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,000
you're going to go into pretty roles

618
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,129
that it has to be earnest and gas is

619
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,960
primarily because those things are going

620
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,720
to hold the flavor through the end of it

621
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,850
if we want to develop through on what

622
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,950
gasps we have to bring it in and then we

623
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:52,779
can combine it start to have it in

624
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,180
varieties you can actually mix cannabis

625
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,529
in a container and put it in the joint

626
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,180
and no one would ever know the

627
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,099
difference because I do with

628
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,830
concentrates all the time where our

629
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:04,689
blending concentrates and give it to you

630
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,490
as a better product because I said

631
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,259
listen I think you need to delivery the

632
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,960
citrus but I'm gonna lay this one in

633
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:12,549
here let me figure out the ratios and I

634
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,600
just weigh it out so I can kind of

635
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,819
recreate it again

636
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,319
I just made the shape because what

637
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:19,119
people doing for wine and it will then a

638
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,429
wine affect how they use so there's no

639
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,500
difference it's combining it

640
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,750
in figure out haven't you people love

641
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,490
the citrus but they burn out quickly

642
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,680
because they don't get high long enough

643
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,750
so what am I gonna do I do some jazz

644
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:40,570
with it so I do some gas with some

645
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:42,279
citrus and now they're building subsets

646
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:44,409
with each one so earth and every little

647
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:47,019
thing below it basically going to go

648
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:56,470
with Turkey and a single word you

649
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:58,569
describe in the South China Sea and so

650
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:21,630
it makes it kind of easy and that's when

651
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:21,629
we use everybody there's a lot of people

652
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:37,300
around I'll put them outside too so I

653
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:40,390
can see the enormous they leave oh wow I

654
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,139
didn't expect to be sober outside yet no

655
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,059
idea

656
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,390
then we take the plan put it inside me

657
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:47,569
all the crazy terrible Wow and it was

658
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,970
just like nice to do

659
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:52,608
thus if for indoor so heavier when I

660
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,639
started transferred outside I mean this

661
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:58,728
terrible mistake because I was on 1212

662
00:28:55,638 --> 00:29:01,189
triggered and so on pushing my plans are

663
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:04,460
officially late because I don't have a

664
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:08,080
45 switch or twelve switch and it's

665
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,769
recently same thing it also has

666
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,519
characteristics that work for that

667
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:15,979
indoor HPS you know at that time it was

668
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,429
all hydroponic once we stripped it into

669
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:18,048
organic

670
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:20,330
you know Roman systems and their

671
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,769
cultivation decades ago but only their

672
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:24,259
romantic systems it would start

673
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:27,739
traveling to spend what is the input on

674
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:29,929
the organic components to McGinnis and

675
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:31,700
to meet water was something of a

676
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:34,249
supernatural propagating effects and it

677
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,590
was one but it's so environmentally

678
00:29:34,249 --> 00:29:38,690
destructive to mining that I don't use

679
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:40,878
it I just try to stay away from this

680
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,639
year I realize that I was doing what the

681
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:44,538
image growing property or environment

682
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:47,808
indiscernible Crescent mine of the earth

683
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:49,519
dry the UNITA so so water doesn't work

684
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:50,658
so it sort of you work with we work with

685
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,589
some of the fish products that they

686
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:53,840
bring them they bring some of those

687
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:57,048
flavors in I noticed that when I was in

688
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:59,898
Hawaii cannabis that was grown with his

689
00:29:57,048 --> 00:30:01,368
ship I thought it was the soil does I'm

690
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,408
in Hawaii I'm growing I'm smoking I'm

691
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:05,538
putting all this is this is Molokai

692
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:07,429
there's a small tiny then I went back

693
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:10,278
honorable counties my friend had a farm

694
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:12,440
and he grow using that material over the

695
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:15,528
hills and it was the same profile and I

696
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:19,940
said cold it wasn't the moment I saw it

697
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:21,528
was the patient it mess so actually

698
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,690
trapped all this crap doesn't really

699
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,690
notice me what am I really

700
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:33,049
and that's a lot of salt a disease they

701
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,789
all distinctly put a playground so

702
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:37,279
cutting-edge put the flavor on advanced

703
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:39,379
movements book the flavor I change

704
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,869
present flavor on it and it was more

705
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,550
relative those methodologies and you

706
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:45,319
know if someone who's actually active

707
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:47,389
addition any profits they can start to

708
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:48,649
tell you which one you use it because

709
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,270
they all have a little bit different

710
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,190
bite and why is that too late so

711
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:54,769
different and the mineral - or something

712
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,200
so those little tiny salty to change my

713
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:58,609
campus for a while there - and so this

714
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,440
is huge because you can talk there about

715
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:03,799
getting so many inexperienced they're

716
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,660
gonna wanna buy twice and buy stuff when

717
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,690
we go hey let's go use all this [ __ ]

718
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,279
let's go make more more in reality of it

719
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,440
is if you wanted the nastiest term

720
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:16,129
profile it was really the most genuine

721
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,130
get it done the opposite plant using the

722
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:21,320
services of our protective so if I want

723
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,180
experience that full range in what I'm

724
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:26,869
supposed to experience I would have a

725
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,940
plant at its worst condition period and

726
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:31,039
ideally not even try to remind the

727
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,799
biology from the where came from so I

728
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,629
just like your stomach biology you have

729
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,700
the stuff in your gut affects how you

730
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,220
function the stuff in the soil changes

731
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,319
paid off so I had specific motorized I

732
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,230
to drive some of it up takes well that

733
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:48,309
changes the quality plan when I'm sure

734
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:53,200
it has a selfless change in tone so your

735
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:53,200
microorganisms effect is also so happy

736
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,308
impact on what you're doing with

737
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:16,369
cannabis and I think that at one time

738
00:31:58,308 --> 00:32:18,980
you know I used to see people and the

739
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:21,709
patient so what I get is I get a number

740
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,569
on a chart right tell me what strain you

741
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,690
Brewin you remember you can't resolve

742
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:30,490
this little busy little separation and a

743
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,490
problem determining what I'm doing

744
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:36,730
[Music]

745
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:40,548
elaborate stuff that I was getting isn't

746
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,769
really where it's coming from

747
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:44,210
Landry's areas whether the human being

748
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:46,759
presented on it that should solve it

749
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,889
arrived so it's not Larry's it's just

750
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,138
that it's real and brace pockets so it

751
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:55,219
was just kind of no pain is supreme real

752
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:56,449
and she no more well than we don't

753
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,240
anything I'm doing these things in life

754
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,308
and people difficulty job people who say

755
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,500
hey listen I'm gonna start to work with

756
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:05,418
what I have here and so to me that's I

757
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,369
saw some candidates that don't refer

758
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:10,130
that's that's phenomenal because it's

759
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:11,148
really easy and depending on what

760
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,850
they're fermenting on what they're

761
00:33:11,148 --> 00:33:18,949
driving in from you start getting a

762
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:22,658
profile and you are relaxing in the

763
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,659
mouth itself and that's

764
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:21,109
jump up and down

765
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:23,179
don't you sold times before you know

766
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,919
turn Testament know what appalls you

767
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,740
either beat other notice on this

768
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:30,489
riveting I'm good the same thing people

769
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:30,489
always come to me

770

[Music]

771
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:38,300
make sure I stay away and I try to give

772
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:39,739
this information people I'm around

773
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,510
because I present them with genetic

774
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:44,569
packages okay these things are good in

775
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:46,850
these circumstances and here I'll give

776
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:49,190
you a sample of it you produced it using

777
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,960
this methodology so I can can kind of

778
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,130
give you the list of the inputs are used

779
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,179
and what we did and where need

780
00:35:53,130 --> 00:36:55,890
yes and then I know where you are so me

781
00:35:57,179 --> 00:37:02,579
and cuz all the criminality it so work

782
00:36:55,889 --> 00:37:05,429
and then we can find what do we know

783
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:09,529
about this so that you know in don't

784
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:09,529
know that and what ladies

785
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:13,579
hmm you can put yourself in the

786
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:16,278
situation is away from how to lock it

787
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:30,499
we're in a market that have fuel citrus

788
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:32,599
and does not say mr. decade you better

789
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,818
get them both together to get around and

790
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:36,680
get the mold together means you work

791
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:39,018
together on these safety projects it's

792
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:41,808
very hard to do a population sit by

793
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:43,639
yourself and most people really are not

794
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:45,470
qualified to make the decision

795
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,509
what's your qualification how many

796
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:48,379
people you've dived into money none then

797
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:50,858
you're not right back

798
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,509
so let's [ __ ] the right guy you

799
00:37:50,858 --> 00:37:55,068
ascertains quality of cannabis flowers

800
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:57,230
let's get you in here to make this

801
00:37:55,068 --> 00:37:57,949
decision and help us out are we going

802
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,278
the right round

803
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:03,199
do you like the profile we work hard

804
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:05,480
work out would you buy it twice and

805
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:08,748
you're going to get this info it's so

806
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,400
important one one thing else is the data

807
00:38:08,748 --> 00:38:12,588
back of am I going the right direction

808
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,880
of what I'm doing because that's the

809
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:15,380
most of all today is just straight run

810
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,289
oh my god in a row in the parking

811
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:20,460
because they're not talking not sharing

812
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:24,029
because we come from such a private

813
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:27,059
culture I am blanking on plot it freaked

814
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:29,880
me out but I didn't have any other

815
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:33,900
option I had such a clear vision one day

816
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:37,410
of death so I had come out of where I

817
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,059
was at and enter normal cannabis and I

818
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:41,730
made that entrance in now I'm not sure

819
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,190
what the lender Street is named after my

820
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:47,929
words can't figure out I wonder how we

821
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,929
didn't land in federal prison

822
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,449
[Music]

823
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:03,710
[Music]

824
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:11,568
so you get together with Roos and you

825
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:20,170
start to work so every year I like get

826
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:20,170
one killer cultivar - so every year

827
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:26,530
let's mistake

828
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:28,929
constantly and then I take these things

829
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,510
that are red-hot and I shared them with

830
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:33,669
people who could use a goddamn help

831
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,900
I don't want state laws like the single

832
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,210
this comes to maybe they're things

833
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,280
because it's sorted for your application

834
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,800
just trust him and then all of a sudden

835
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,150
you got somebody else's surviving even

836
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,289
they need them you have no idea who's

837
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,450
going to give you a leg up on

838
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:48,670
combinations of street show you don't

839
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:50,889
know it and it's going to get worse

840
00:40:48,670 --> 00:41:00,010
and this is how you really function is

841
00:40:50,889 --> 00:41:01,929
marketability separation commercial

842
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,870
schlagg saunas go big on let's all calm

843
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:07,059
down boys go ahead there has to be a

844
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:07,539
place for craft to be passed me it's

845
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,489
just that

846
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,960
how you had people do one a lot it's not

847
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:13,299
going to be things over price either

848
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,699
that's gonna be exceptionally marketed

849
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:19,720
that's a whole lot of skill set this one

850
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:20,769
is how fair price the canvas and you

851
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:22,689
only were going to be able to do this

852
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:25,329
begin into varietals that have a high

853
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,269
velocity and you start to work those

854
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:33,610
those are those varieties and everything

855
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:35,920
goes I know that it goes on yes

856
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:37,990
and so when you not hold on G's they're

857
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,150
earning I hold og that are family i

858
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:42,489
holding jeans in a sense because we

859
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,440
change their community they want citrus

860
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:46,119
this year and money gas next year the

861
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,030
wire connects here what's the examples

862
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:50,139
of those ghost SFP and lemon blood by

863
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,120
Morales age right

864
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:55,119
so it lets me use the very specific

865
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:57,549
lines that people interpreted as see

866
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,339
citrusy or earthy or all within the

867
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:02,620
ocean realm I make sure I hold them and

868
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:05,369
then I just know that this market is not

869
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:08,159
bad I love 20 years at

870
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:10,829
and you just let that step run because

871
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:13,259
they're not going to have the population

872
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:14,730
will shift within them so basically easy

873
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:16,318
once you start to build up your

874
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,259
libraries once you start to get your

875
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:21,869
turf divisions broke it down when they

876
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:26,250
start to really see what works with you

877
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:27,960
on your farm and is exceptional you get

878
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:32,818
out into the public or just going to get

879
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:35,970
yourself some honest feedback we haven't

880
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:38,159
had a the why California central line

881
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:40,048
guys so my guys always come in and want

882
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,608
to tell you that you stupid and even do

883
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:44,940
it straight up and it basically telling

884
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:47,250
you you're uneducated so I spent the day

885
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,750
with this guy most of the day I heard I

886
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,670
was uneducated but at the end of the day

887
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,858
he was a while what does qualify to

888
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:55,409
Jenny pot I said exactly because

889
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:57,960
cannabis is complex it's not had a lack

890
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:59,879
of all in terms so why don't I show you

891
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,889
don't know and so because of that you

892
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,940
have to be able to handle the effect and

893
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:08,469
so if you can't adjust and how much I

894
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,880
can smoke in a row

895
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:11,409
vision how much I'm blowing through the

896
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:17,730
signal sitting there in hot weather like

897
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:21,159
I said you wouldn't get away because

898
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:30,280
quality I'm not trying to make something

899
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:32,019
become something can you taste my

900
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,500
favorite one is can you taste the berry

901
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:37,079
in it

902
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,079
no but if I hope a little bit more

903
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:53,109
reading terms I start realizing with all

904
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,449
the scientific stuff that's coming with

905
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:57,029
rot-resistant that our reading programs

906
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:59,259
haven't changed dramatically over time

907
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:01,180
but primarily when you're working with

908
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,050
with with reading observing drove all

909
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:06,098
this how to say with a complimentary

910
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,260
complimentary box people start looking

911
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,329
towards crap together and it all jams up

912
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,220
and you're like wait a second I want

913
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:14,109
dissimilar stuff to come together form

914
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:16,209
Union I don't watches the bunch of [ __ ]

915
00:44:14,108 --> 00:44:18,880
don't in a basket that's that's not that

916
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,920
attractive in anyone and what are we

917
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,510
trying to put together and the problem

918
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,818
you better for me is that it's never

919
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,410
gonna be a sexy male it's going to do

920
00:44:24,818 --> 00:44:29,440
this because I'm used to using example

921
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:34,348
my son's an international and my

922
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:37,740
daughter is 36 - I'm like a genetic runt

923
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:37,740
what happened

924
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:08,530
see is the names and you're going to do

925
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,360
the same thing because people don't

926
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:12,760
understand it's totally not as simple

927
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,559
you can always go through population and

928
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,940
find outliers but once you're going to

929
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,279
put it together so there's a greater

930
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:21,190
population so that I don't just find the

931
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,620
only one that fit the bill I have 40

932
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:25,420
that fit the goddamn bill and I was 40 I

933
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:27,880
thought the one that could handle more

934
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,440
logically but loading a Lin than another

935
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,260
one that have to trigger so to finish

936
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,079
but first and it gets enough wax they

937
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,370
keep the mono isn't it's got enough

938
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,769
secondary bonds to hold in the thing

939
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,719
that's a good rule but I have to go

940
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:43,119
through a big population to do this and

941
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:44,919
so in your breathing ah cestus that's

942
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,750
what I have to look at scientific stuff

943
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,820
is going to help us tremendously 5 plus

944
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,440
it's a wonderful tool because it lets us

945
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,380
take a look that's why I love I love so

946
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,970
much I love the technology because it

947
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,849
cuts all the [ __ ] stories are out of

948
00:45:54,969 --> 00:46:00,209
room I've read it's not you stole from

949
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:00,210
him I'm sure

950
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:10,259
[Music]

951
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,769
because you screwing people over like

952
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:14,769
these guys

953
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:24,108
this kid it wasn't real so he reads this

954
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:27,500
stream and he sells a girl to dispensary

955
00:46:24,108 --> 00:46:29,750
in Sacramento business and stuff

956
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,809
maybe name it and it becomes green

957
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:35,239
ribbon ribbon he comes it's unbelievable

958
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:36,980
strain of it monitor festival day so I

959
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:41,509
hold this a moment holds the funny good

960
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:44,420
so I hold this cup and I'm talking

961
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:45,890
parrot seven years later I'm here but in

962
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:47,990
the meantime the second years old this

963
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:50,389
guy it's been credited to a dispensary

964
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:53,149
in Sacramento as the creators they read

965
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:55,368
it they did it if only people who had so

966
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,930
I have this it's at all these different

967
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:58,548
breeding projects it's all over the

968
00:46:56,929 --> 00:47:04,308
place I mean everything and we're

969
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:05,239
friends and one day says hey and it's

970
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:07,130
the same as yours

971
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,348
and I said how it's easy you got robbed

972
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,519
because I know where I got it from and I

973
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:13,190
know you know the really must be the

974
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:16,278
greater the planet and so he got screwed

975
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:18,380
by the dispensary and so we just renamed

976
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:20,239
green ribbon where we we call the career

977
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,028
evidence really does like green candy

978
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,588
cane every green crackerjack but since

979
00:47:23,028 --> 00:47:26,028
it's been called the river so long it's

980
00:47:24,588 --> 00:47:30,849
just I I made sure his name that

981
00:47:26,028 --> 00:47:30,849
attaches we put it out like that because

982
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:38,510
how's anybody gonna trust you it you

983
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,280
wouldn't jump over all their crap and

984
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,780
the problem is that

985
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,180
that's what the dole game is really

986
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,650
about faith and trust and so that's why

987
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:47,629
I'm having such a miserable time right

988
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:51,139
now with the new industry because nobody

989
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:53,090
hasn't in faith and trust and so you

990
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:56,569
guys let Mary creates us in front of the

991
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:59,300
stream 52 days and or 26% o and th

992
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:01,430
because up all songs editor it has every

993
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:04,630
knowing you want which means it have

994
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:07,969
solutely moves from dispensary markets

995
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:10,670
legal markets or with that shape you

996
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:12,379
sculpt it into complex nasty little

997
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:16,700
beasts so you come back and get it again

998
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:19,099
but lo and behold he gets ripped you

999
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:21,139
know you you this what you use it and so

1000
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:22,579
far mostly because it allows you to take

1001
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:25,309
a little to see what you use and find

1002
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:26,029
out what's inside this what's the other

1003
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:27,860
buyers

1004
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,210
we found some weird stuff where we

1005
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,099
notice that all the oh geez that have

1006
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:33,019
two super numbers have let us come right

1007
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:34,639
in here so I know that all my own genes

1008
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:37,099
that have higher numbers involve doesn't

1009
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:38,359
spawn in those so somewhere that the day

1010
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:40,339
something came into what was happening

1011
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,140
but you want to see all this to know

1012
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,570
because that might be where the tall is

1013
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:46,279
kind of rough that's why this one those

1014
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,860
inhabitants because it's in that piece

1015
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,519
if we identify those what will make

1016
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,070
things

1017
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:54,759
so I hunted all the CVS down admission

1018
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:57,350
you changed all the CDs [ __ ] right ESMA

1019
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,590
see you hunt for a while because it was

1020
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:02,029
what was eating but it's five those

1021
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,860
would have been so much easier because

1022
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:06,080
I'm going to let me understand better

1023
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,150
what I was looking at and I would have

1024
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,279
been able to see better him sustaining

1025
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:12,590
genetic lines is where humans live

1026
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,390
so when I started getting I started

1027
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,980
getting material from Pakistan and

1028
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:17,629
started letting me see this when they

1029
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,730
started let me see what was coming from

1030
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:21,800
Pakistan directly and started below

1031
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,519
that's all these numbers of ratios a

1032
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,390
common trouble

1033
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:25,670
we're not looking at the right

1034
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:27,920
population say it doesn't exist it

1035
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,750
exists five right here same with you

1036
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,130
terms nice I'm going to stuff you just

1037
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:34,190
gonna go into the work but what most

1038
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:37,730
people looked at what is lazy work

1039
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:40,039
there's not any population since I put

1040
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:42,289
ten seeds out and you should take those

1041
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:44,090
ten seeds and you should cross the damn

1042
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:46,309
things and get a thousand seeds out of

1043
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:48,079
that and go through that population then

1044
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:53,380
you find an outlier that work with you

1045
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,380
and people look that's a lot of work to

1046
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:57,130
understand

1047
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:07,420
because ultimately what is the person

1048
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:09,460
interface with you that's all they know

1049
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,980
is that they don't give a [ __ ] about

1050
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,329
anything else and so if you're one

1051
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,010
Spanish pleased with it numbers only one

1052
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:17,049
I've got a five-star service in the Bay

1053
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:21,820
Area that I use to work with they're

1054
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:24,700
friends of mine constantly because I

1055
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,500
know what five-star wine should look

1056
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:28,839
like and so he just comes up he lets me

1057
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,730
feed him non-stop with every single new

1058
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:33,190
thing I'm playing with after I run my

1059
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,960
own se I stop and so we've run it

1060
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,490
through him so it just lets us see what

1061
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,110
it looks like because he produces

1062
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:41,529
everything indoor organically and I'm

1063
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:44,470
outdoor God so his work lets me see my

1064
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:46,840
beautiful cuts in a different format and

1065
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:48,579
sometimes there is awesome and sometimes

1066
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,280
they're better than your damn that was

1067
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:53,110
really pretty nursing and so you have to

1068
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,490
be able to get you some partners get you

1069
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,380
some people to the different artists

1070
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:58,839
take a look and see what's really moving

1071
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:01,260
you go to dispensary people I want in

1072
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:06,010
the dispensaries got 400 selections I go

1073
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:07,510
few million something tasty and I got

1074
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:10,840
the [ __ ] oh these are the ones that are

1075
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:15,760
fly out the door and I'm not skipper

1076
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:20,280
come on turtle lean on me night oh I've

1077
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,280
been any news words

1078
00:51:31,619 --> 00:52:10,720
so people understand and you present

1079
00:51:54,699 --> 00:52:12,009
them in these arrays because cannot stop

1080
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:14,669
the [ __ ] this little gang right here

1081
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:17,829
where I think I'm better than Yunus and

1082
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,918
it's about what's walking what's the

1083
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:21,119
basis

1084
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:24,268
experience in these different directions

1085
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,150
so that this way people can experience

1086
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:30,058
which I'm going to give them and you're

1087
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:31,739
you're able to really get among them and

1088
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:33,539
that's where our pieces are I think

1089
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:37,039
we're running out of time talk to us

1090
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:37,039
your questions out

1091
00:53:08,329 --> 00:54:11,369
so 6026

1092
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:16,920
right so last thing is even though this

1093
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:19,409
incredibly excessively hot dry so now

1094
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,119
we're going back to the website the

1095
00:54:19,409 --> 00:54:23,309
canvas varieties that were chosen for

1096
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,769
those situations when the temperature

1097
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:29,610
changes or it gets bored it's conversing

1098
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:32,730
moister change in tone and that's where

1099
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:35,519
in your is a strong because they can

1100
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:38,219
keep the damn thing the same all the

1101
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,769
time but they don't ever ever get the

1102
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:42,269
wax is high up and so what you get is

1103
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:44,599
will never get a sense with dirt being

1104
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:48,059
put on an indoor that touches about

1105
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:50,069
bottle terpene yes because i can protect

1106
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:52,769
that and i begin a higher percentage of

1107
00:54:50,070 --> 00:55:00,769
cannabinoids in a specific indoor

1108
00:54:52,769 --> 00:55:00,769
because I so you'd like

1109
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:25,500
you know I mean typically I would say

1110
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:28,079
not the average smoker but if you were a

1111
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,539
store and was in the summer from June to

1112
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:33,000
September if you see 90 days of torture

1113
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:34,380
sales but then as soon as September 1

1114
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,338
it's telling everybody come interns

1115
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:40,410
Network so all the back to work now is

1116
00:55:37,338 --> 00:55:42,059
Seattle s'mores so how long we we're

1117
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:44,789
going to experience this in a minute and

1118
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:47,489
remember I didn't I just created an

1119
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:49,440
entire bed letting like rebuy Bakugan

1120
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:53,639
inside that little potency bridles

1121
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:56,280
that's about a 10 but it's fun Richard

1122
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:57,809
miles is full-bodied I said hey listen

1123
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,940
but while the tourists walking is coming

1124
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:01,949
in the stuff at are small its friendly

1125
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:05,269
people and then I make a stick and I'm

1126
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:05,269
just like me that's normal

1127
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,730
to really want to spend what are these

1128
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:14,619
markets that are going to come in in

1129
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:16,719
these windows and only these people

1130
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:20,289
gonna be and what would they like to

1131
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:21,909
experience and I think so much of it is

1132
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:45,880
you know this beautiful expressive in

1133
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:48,250
the full this ears there's nothing you

1134
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:54,329
use that doesn't have an impact it's

1135
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:57,460
just really about what people try to

1136
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:58,719
because of the soul from our black

1137
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,639
market type right where you're going to

1138
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,529
get the most out of your way so the

1139
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:04,420
problem is your load this plant up and

1140
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,040
you're you're pushing it to a level and

1141
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:09,880
you can because we keep adding more

1142
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:12,190
bacteria and we can push this

1143
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,559
they're rated hot so we can create the

1144
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:17,139
situation but the plants so loaded up

1145
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,000
there it's unhealthy and that's what so

1146
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:21,879
many pathogenic routes come from so I'm

1147
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,369
back to upload my motor problems went

1148
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,530
away you don't say like it disappeared

1149
00:57:24,369 --> 00:57:30,849
dramatically don't do is increase my

1150
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:32,590
skull you open up the skull and so when

1151
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:34,719
you're when you're talking about getting

1152
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:36,850
food into canvas in terms of flaws as

1153
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,129
long as I have adequate amount of

1154
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:40,839
bacteria going I'm going to have a take

1155
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:43,000
on that sauce it's the hardest one all

1156
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,070
day but I'm gonna get it I don't want to

1157
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,440
drive it too heavy if I go too much

1158
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:50,910
poloidal a it's tynus sharp going too

1159
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:54,670
much of this direction leaves up a

1160
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:56,379
vegetarian ideally I go to a pop in the

1161
00:57:54,670 --> 00:58:00,940
cat world so a lot of it is just

1162
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:03,220
building which which variety of canvas

1163
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:05,530
that you're growing works well with the

1164
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:09,129
mixed reviews so then the bacteria

1165
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:13,240
dominate the culture of bacteria that

1166
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:15,610
you're using and just with the compost

1167
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:17,049
teas depending on what how most eaten so

1168
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:18,640
if I use a synergy tea which is an

1169
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,019
excellent team I use that as a

1170
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:21,849
vegetative tea because I think that's a

1171
00:58:20,019 --> 00:58:24,009
50 fungal 50 bacteria right so I get

1172
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:25,929
good into mix and it drives me

1173
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:28,540
but then when I switch in a fly on tea

1174
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:31,929
from green bicycles that one has more of

1175
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:33,639
like a limestone play it pageants home

1176
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:36,069
to the cannabis that's sharp

1177
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:37,539
and I did that's why I'm using that

1178
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,850
means that rock because it has such a

1179
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:43,029
beautiful it just activates it but it

1180
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:46,058
leaves a nice clean clear we pulled up

1181
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:48,829
and pull the tops out there

1182
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:51,859
and I use these a lot because these are

1183
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:53,480
the big competitions but doesn't a

1184
00:58:51,858 --> 00:58:54,498
competition - and I get a couple hundred

1185
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,480
samples that come in

1186
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:58,548
you see a thousand so unless you see a

1187
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,679
big population and that's important to

1188
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:03,498
say listen thousand this one clearly

1189
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:07,129
stood out and that methodology did it

1190
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:09,588
we're back up on the inputs and rely on

1191
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:11,088
the genetic form and finally I think we

1192
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,619
thought it was I still didn't wish I had

1193
00:59:11,088 --> 00:59:15,190
a magnet because we used to look like

1194
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:19,490
when cattle a graph like used to be

1195
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:20,088
doing difference and only being hot so

1196
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,098
awesome

1197
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:24,578
it was the most wonderful thing happen

1198
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:26,869
economy California experienced wild oval

1199
00:59:24,579 --> 00:59:28,880
but those areas have gone and I just

1200
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:30,380
really don't want to I got to love my

1201
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:36,858
god I'm looking over my lap said you're

1202
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:39,650
right about their hostility shape and

1203
00:59:36,858 --> 00:59:41,869
the main point is if your market you

1204
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:43,970
want the flavor you're Canada's you're

1205
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:46,670
selling to a store and the people there

1206
00:59:43,969 --> 00:59:49,308
in that store love that stuff don't

1207
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:51,470
change that's what you don't don't break

1208
00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:52,910
what's not wrong it's just you don't

1209
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:55,459
know you know but you lay out your base

1210
00:59:52,909 --> 00:59:58,489
mix lay this stuff out and let the

1211
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,440
oxidation again is it good because you

1212
00:59:58,489 --> 01:00:06,139
can't even you can't you can't detect it

1213
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:10,239
so it's going it's a quick question you

1214
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:12,679
see the feature of my cannabis culture

1215
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:15,380
areas like the

1216
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:56,419
and we talked about like market demand

1217
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:58,010
on regional boundaries time to at least

1218
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,200
it allows you to have historically

1219
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:02,390
production zones and and you can build

1220
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:05,210
up ran from that that's the whole

1221
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:08,299
question pane and they that champagne is

1222
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:11,510
for grapes common production methodology

1223
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:13,880
so same methodology of former a choices

1224
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:17,120
so this way they can share anybody's

1225
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:19,099
wine anybody else because it's not the

1226
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,309
great that makes you a needs the same

1227
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:24,500
every process that defines the house

1228
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:27,889
envoy and burgundy which is the

1229
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:30,639
appellation that defines the burden so

1230
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:37,539
all the champagne

1231
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:37,539
one group each little Appalachians here

1232
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:01,019
[Music]

1233
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:44,599
so we prescribe future this this role

1234
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:47,060
that does the whole day of time so all

1235
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:50,630
the some applause roll the dice will

1236
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:53,269
never be rolling on time straight up and

1237
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:56,990
this one is can clearly separate

1238
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:59,509
yourself in cannabis from the curriculum

1239
01:02:56,989 --> 01:03:00,829
how do you define yourself and how to

1240
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:03,870
get you along

1241
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:07,650
since and how many people have to merge

1242
01:03:03,869 --> 01:03:09,989
to do that it's better than commodities

1243
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,730
margarine superior than crap and if you

1244
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:14,009
wanted to small the exactly what already

1245
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:16,530
bought like for me like my farm I

1246
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:18,060
brought my father ten pounds so I had to

1247
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:21,330
build me be a lot larger farm

1248
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:23,130
I made my farm ten thousand square feet

1249
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:26,779
because it was being craft and I know

1250
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:30,420
that I can move all those ten thousand

1251
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:32,510
so I don't worry about it so why do I

1252
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:34,920
want to stress on your farm

1253
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:37,560
so what I recommend to people is

1254
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,269
diversify what you do like you've got to

1255
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:43,679
have some more skill sets in the game

1256
01:03:39,269 --> 01:03:45,539
when I when I go to do what I do I look

1257
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:48,269
at it from a bunch of the respectives at

1258
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:51,570
once because I realized a long time ago

1259
01:03:48,269 --> 01:03:56,119
I could be wrong because I knew that i

1260
01:03:51,570 --> 01:04:02,160
sat there a selfie front I said oh [ __ ]

1261
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:05,670
the nursery guy stores I was done I had

1262
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:07,619
a pretty messed up a tree and I realized

1263
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:10,260
that I didn't have the tree cover guy

1264
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:13,289
because every single branch was

1265
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:16,080
dependent on the hole and I didn't have

1266
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:18,230
a home and so I said all Christ so this

1267
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,230
is

1268
01:04:21,989 --> 01:05:40,568
so I was surprised how my so-called

1269
01:05:28,269 --> 01:05:41,920
brothers I know but like what you're

1270
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:44,380
going to realize though is that we're

1271
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,630
not in that time period though you're

1272
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:50,730
another time period now it's yourself

1273
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:50,730
table mentally

1274
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:28,690
did you agree to get in the deal

1275
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:31,390
nobody honest is ever gotten [ __ ] by

1276
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:32,200
shady person you had to win Oh sounds

1277
01:06:31,389 --> 01:06:35,339
too good to be true

1278
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:35,339
while women participate
