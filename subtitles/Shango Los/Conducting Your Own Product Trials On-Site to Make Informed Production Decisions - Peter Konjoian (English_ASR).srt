settings today Peters going to talk

39
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,260
about conducting your own product trials

40
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:33,549
on site to make more informed production

41
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,550
decisions please welcome

42
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,560

43
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:43,700
Thank You shake no I'm hurting in the

44
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,478
back okay good afternoon welcome we're

45
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:51,049
going to spend the next 45 minutes

46
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:55,000
talking about how a grower in his or her

47
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:58,310
operation can reliably correctly

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,590
appropriately conduct product trials in

49
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,390
order to make decisions on what the

50
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,439
products you might want to use an

51
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,909
operation compare side by side etc I'm

52
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,900
going to ask you to put your seat belt

53
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:16,129
on strap yourself in I've got quite a

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,969
bit that I want to cover and if you have

55
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:21,530
questions raise your hand I think I'd

56
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,469
prefer to get through my presentation

57
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,829
and save a little time at the end just

58
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,750
so I can get through the a little bit of

59
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:32,750
science and if you're going to allow me

60
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,000
in these 45 minutes I want to take

61
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,639
everybody back at some point to middle

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,219
school or junior high school for someone

63
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:47,869
my age or we're going to review the

64
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:51,620
scientific method and if that white

65
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:54,439
conduct on-site trials you might say

66
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,959
that you're looking to reduce costs

67
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:00,079
production costs which would save money

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,870
you might say you want to look at crop

69
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:06,079
performance and quality increase yield

70
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:09,049
which will raise revenue it doesn't

71
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:13,599
matter what reason in the end we want to

72
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:16,510
make more money and as a private sector

73
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,120
researcher and also a commercial

74
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:23,659
greenhouse operator after my academic

75
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,099
days ended and I returned to the private

76
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:29,419
sector that's the bottom line folks and

77
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:32,780
even though I've spent time

78
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:35,389
on faculty at universities it's the real

79
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,169
world that I really enjoy

80
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:41,029
operating from question happy conducted

81
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,549
product trials anyone any audience have

82
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,560
you have you done this in your operation

83
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,380
the perhaps before I even ask for that

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:53,000
show of hands who's with me today

85
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:56,289
do I have growers you folks I'm from the

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,360
outside your industry so I'm commercial

87
00:03:56,289 --> 00:04:03,199
ornamental crops poinsettias geraniums

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,380
I'm edible hydroponic vegetable

89
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,810
herb crops so our terminology differs a

90
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:12,650
bit I say grow when you say cultivator I

91
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,650
say cutting you say clone but I think we

92
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,930
will will be able to get through the 45

93
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,739
minutes together so how many growers are

94
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,168
cultivators do we have here today and

95
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:26,839
how many of you are in the state of

96
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:30,349
Colorado do I have anyone outside of

97
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:35,089
Colorado I came from Massachusetts where

98
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:36,620
are we from Oklahoma all right have you

99
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,560
conduct a product trials were you

100
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,959
confident with your results and was a

101
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,389
product our practice changed we don't

102
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,728
have turning in the 45 minutes for me to

103
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:50,120
welcome you in to answer these questions

104
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:52,279
but these are the questions I thought we

105
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,590
should put on the table for us to think

106
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:58,519
about why are we conducting on-site

107
00:04:54,589 --> 00:05:01,549
trials well whose claims are you going

108
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,430
to trust and I'm not here to stir any

109
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,530
pot or create any trouble but the

110
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,290
manufacturer the distributor the sales

111
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:14,418
rep walk in the trade show there are

112
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,910
claims the length of well the height of

113
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:19,370
the fourteener

114
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:23,419
who are we going to trust I saw a phrase

115
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:27,410
at one booth claiming backed by science

116
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:31,490
and the statement concerns me not so

117
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:34,129
much folks for the booth that is using

118
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,319
it that booth might be based inside

119
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:39,349
and reputable incredible and not

120
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:43,479
criticizing them but as I walk around

121
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:46,968
your tradeshow as a traditional

122
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:50,978
horticulturist used to my own trade

123
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:54,649
shows with greenhouse products and

124
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:58,278
systems we don't have that great so I

125
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:59,988
asked myself why is this industry why

126
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:03,319
didn't somebody feel like they need to

127
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:05,959
say and it may be what's bringing us

128
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,080
together in this room there are so many

129
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:11,088
products there are so many claims how

130
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,579
are you and I as growers went to sift

131
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:16,550
through that to make a decision of what

132
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:18,818
product to purchase I went around

133
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,418
yesterday through the trade show and

134
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:26,449
counted the number of booths featuring

135
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:28,908
LED lighting and there are about seven

136
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:33,288
different manufacturers perhaps 10 or a

137
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:35,569
dozen at most booths offering lighting I

138
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:35,988
went around this morning before the

139
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,908
tradeshow

140
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:43,998
opened and counted fertilizers

141
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:49,759
microbiota biological products and I

142
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:52,909
lost count after 20 so after describing

143
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,669
my world as commercial greenhouse

144
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:58,158
production commercial horticulture we

145
00:06:55,668 --> 00:07:00,618
don't have we don't have a fraction of

146
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:03,978
that many booths offering fertilizers

147
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:07,509
and biological products so there's a lot

148
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:09,740
of confusion that you as a grower are

149
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,959
feeling as you walk around trying to

150
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,179
decide what products to buy all right

151
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,129
question where's this root front

152
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:18,378
whatever I covered that thank you for

153
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:21,180
inviting me today good thing it wasn't

154
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:24,509
next week folks

155
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,389
you wouldn't have be here from in Dover

156
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:31,469
Massachusetts now most you being from

157
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:34,680
Colorado I tip my cap we Brady and

158
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,530
Peyton Manning had battles over their

159
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,240
careers and I complement you

160
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:42,839
congratulate you on a couple of years

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,740
ago with Peyton going out on the top we

162
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,329
keep waiting for Brady to decline but he

163
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,569
keeps digging down into the bag of

164
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:53,759
tricks all right question what brought

165
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,170
us together today what brings a

166
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,420
commercial greenhouses operator

167
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,330
researcher like me to your educational

168
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,030
appropriate one of my statements is or

169
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:05,729
my censuses cannabis is evolving

170
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:08,989
ladies and gentlemen into a mainstream

171
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:11,850
commercial horticulture crop is a

172
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:15,480
mainstream commercial corner culturist

173
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:20,370
I'm welcome welcome fellow brothers and

174
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:24,060
new crops and I predict within two or

175
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:26,670
three years that our national greenhouse

176
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:32,059
conferences we will be offering tracts

177
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:35,759
on cannabis and inviting you to join us

178
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:38,429
agree or not in horticulture my opinion

179
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,730
is a plant doesn't plant as a plant and

180
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:44,759
I know that some folks in this industry

181
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:47,100
don't like hearing me say that so I'm

182
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,789
going to qualify it a bit there's

183
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,420
perhaps a qualification the

184
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:55,500
pharmaceutical injection regulations and

185
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:58,229
during a couple of presentations

186
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,580
yesterday that I sat in and attended I

187
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:06,240
learned a lot and Wow the culture and

188
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,970
production of cannabis in my mind a

189
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,519
plant as a plant it's some of those post

190
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,399
production restrictions and

191
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,340
characteristics that do separate it from

192
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,819
some of our other crops but in terms of

193
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,149
similarities to

194
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,560
I'm used to working with the

195
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:26,860
photoperiodism of cannabis and

196
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:30,459
poinsettia are identical the nutrition

197
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,490
of tomato on cannabis are similar so

198
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:36,670
again my point a plant is a plant if you

199
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:39,779
are here in the previous presentation

200
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:43,649
one of the speakers used one of her

201
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:47,649
favorite phrases that healthy groups

202
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:51,069
mean healthy plants I have my own

203
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:53,620
version of that and as my children

204
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,720
brought their grammar school classes to

205
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,250
our greenhouse each spring for field

206
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:03,120
trips my phrase to the youngsters was

207
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:07,360
remains happy roots make happy shoes and

208
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:12,820
I share that with fellow growers were

209
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:17,440
never too old to learn and some of those

210
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,900
phrases are timeless and ageless an

211
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,140
observation your industry traditionally

212
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:26,199
grows indoors and is expanding into the

213
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:28,480
green house mine traditionally grows in

214
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,530
the greenhouse and is expanding indoors

215
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,870
with vertical farming and locally grown

216
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:37,419
vegetable and food crops folks we have a

217
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,779
lot of our experience to share with one

218
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:43,089
another I am humbled that you invite me

219
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:47,169
into your world I would graciously

220
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:50,379
invite you into mine and being a

221
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:54,039
lifelong grower I'm one that does not

222
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:56,700
believe in clothes shop trade secrets I

223
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,620
believe that together we're stronger and

224
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,550
the more we share the more time we spend

225
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:06,970
together the better we become as growers

226
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:10,719
what is research what is a tribe if I

227
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:12,769
had more time with you today we get into

228
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,278
some detail what differentiates

229
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:18,379
research experiment from a trial for all

230
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:21,439
for today's purpose I'm going to say

231
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:23,689
this doesn't matter either one executed

232
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,149
well will generate more useful

233
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,540
information than the other if executed

234
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:32,149
poorly so my message in this 45 minutes

235
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:34,039
is how are we going to execute it well

236
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,230
how are we going to run this trial or

237
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,259
experiment so we learned something and

238
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:45,589
have confidence and change your practice

239
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:47,509
or bring on a product because here's

240
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:49,580
your round little rule if you write

241
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:54,080
anything down and want to write this

242
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:57,170
slide down this is a the objective the

243
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,080
opening page of a plant physiology

244
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:02,929
textbook from my graduate school days at

245
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,778
Ohio State University starts out like

246
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:07,789
this a good observer doesn't see what

247
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:10,458
he's looking for if it's not there and

248
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:14,899
does see what he's not looking for if it

249
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:17,989
is think about that just for sale the

250
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:20,240
first part of that we want to make sure

251
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,240
we're not biased we might have an

252
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,759
expectation that a fertilizer is going

253
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:31,310
to generate a certain result but if it's

254
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:33,919
not there don't make it up the second

255
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:37,369
half says ok would be a good observer

256
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:41,860
and we mess with that scientific method

257
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:45,078
if something unexpected happens let Ric

258
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:49,519
let's understand it and try to figure

259
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:51,289
out why it happened question for the

260
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,409
current categories that require

261
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:56,629
euthanized growers to make decisions you

262
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:59,078
can walk around your tradeshow lighting

263
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:04,600
source we mentioned some of the booths

264
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:08,199
growing medium fertilizers injectors

265
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,200
biological products

266
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:12,860
the drill we'd go on the list right all

267
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:15,859
the inputs that you and I used to

268
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,409
produce a crowd and each within each one

269
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,289
of those categories there are decisions

270
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:25,818
to be made there are salesmen coming to

271
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:27,799
you saying buy my product and you're the

272
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:29,088
one that's going to make the decision so

273
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,039
how are you going to test some of these

274
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:35,079
things here's a research greenhouse at

275
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:37,669
Ohio State where we're alternating

276
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:41,479
mercury vapor and high pressure sodium

277
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:44,539
lamps to try and even out the spectrum

278
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,000
of supplemental light now many of you is

279
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:50,929
in indoor production don't have the

280
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,948
luxury of this height from the light to

281
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:57,769
the crop canopy so in this case with

282
00:13:54,948 --> 00:14:00,859
that height we can spread and even out

283
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:03,740
that spectrum here's my research

284
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:07,699
greenhouse that Massachusetts on the

285
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,519
left is a flattened rain experimental

286
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:14,139
system on the right is a nutrient film

287
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:18,759
channel system when I do most of my

288
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:22,850
vegetable and herb research in I

289
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,649
constructed a growth shaper in one of my

290
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,069
warehouses several years ago for a

291
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:33,169
project I was involved in with a working

292
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:36,610
with LED light technology and this this

293
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:40,419
is really exciting in advancing

294
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,889
technology as you're all aware we are

295
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:46,338
looking at tailored spectrum and

296
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:49,250
adjustable intensity and all of that put

297
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:52,220
together for me as a researcher I'm

298
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,620
looking to use this technology to

299
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,970
reproduce sunlight or the question I'm

300
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:02,169
asking as a scientist is does this

301
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:07,100
technology give us enough power to

302
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:08,809
reproduce the Sun all right once we do

303
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,509
that if the answer is yes we can

304
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:14,059
reproduce sunlight with intensity

305
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:17,870
over the course of the day dynamic

306
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:20,809
spectrum as as the day progresses then I

307
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,778
believe we can optimize it so if we can

308
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:27,409
reproduce it reliably then I think that

309
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:29,600
final step is to make it even better in

310
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:33,078
order to do that this is an aerial of my

311
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,320
greenhouse range outside of Boston this

312
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:38,989
house is where I conduct most of my

313
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,050
research this is the warehouse with that

314
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,509
growth chamber and I think you can put

315
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:48,129
together what I'm trying to do what's

316
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:51,289
exciting for me is to be indoors

317
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:54,409
conducting research a hundred feet away

318
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:58,009
from the greenhouse conducting the same

319
00:15:54,409 --> 00:16:01,159
research so then we can learn how we're

320
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:06,230
going to manipulate maximize optimize

321
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:08,059
either of the environments shift gears

322
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,519
and I like to put some pictures in so

323
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:10,879
the dismount on both points light for

324
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,039
you

325
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,639
this is a commercial greenhouse

326
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:20,599
installation of dosatron injectors for

327
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,149
fertilizer injection nutrition nutrition

328
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,370
and control and you can see with the

329
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,799
five injectors different sized injectors

330
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,659
we've got Taylor magician opportunities

331
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:33,528
selective flow delivery

332
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:36,049
that's pretty flexible and there are

333
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:37,879
systems more automated than that

334
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:39,740
pictured I don't have enough time to

335
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,528
show them I've got all kinds of pictures

336
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,889
from my travels and then I'm going to

337
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:48,350
drop down to low-tech flexible manual

338
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,750
operation this is a picture of one of my

339
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:54,019
greenhouses my propagation greenhouse

340
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:57,500
we're taking the same concept that we

341
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:59,480
want flexibility we want control and let

342
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,690
me just walk through what what we're

343
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,419
doing here in this irrigation setup I've

344
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:10,250
got clear municipal water coming in I

345
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:12,980
got acid treated water for miss

346
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:16,539
system and seed germination and cutting

347
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,430
routing and then I've got my central

348
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:22,039
irrigation and my central fertilizer

349
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,900
injector that's supplying in this case

350
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,899
I'm still talking about 200 parts per

351
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,820
million nitrogen rather than DC and then

352
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,820
if it's a little dark but can you see

353
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:34,309
this dosatron on the floor that's on a

354
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:37,759
five gallon bucket with a different

355
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:40,579
solution so depending on how I doubt

356
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,700
this and it's not automated they're not

357
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:47,389
solenoids it's by hand so you don't

358
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:50,059
don't believe somebody that says it has

359
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,720
to be automated you can still do it by

360
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,690
hand

361
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,049
so I can select clear water

362
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:00,950
I can select simply with the acidified

363
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:03,889
clear water I could before I go the air

364
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:07,309
if I want a light fertilizer solution I

365
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,230
would take clear water bail run it

366
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:11,750
through that dough so try and pick up a

367
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:14,000
hundred parts per million if I want my

368
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,309
standard 200 parts per million nitrogen

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,740
I select that one and down below there's

370
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:21,950
a bypass to the dosatron so you bypass

371
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:27,250
it and 200 if I decide that I've got a

372
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:27,250
very hungry crop then I can go ahead and

373
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,450
take the 200 pass it through the second

374
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:34,879
injector pick up another hundred and

375
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,400
half three five alright so there's all

376
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,560
kinds of flexibility that you and I can

377
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,130
install in our greenhouse and it doesn't

378
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:46,879
have to be computer control here's a

379
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:50,390
project I'm working on with MIT called

380
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,320
open AG and we happen to be working with

381
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:57,538
the Ferrero company you're familiar with

382
00:18:54,319 --> 00:19:01,288
the chocolate-covered hazelnut

383
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:04,769
Koya for arrow roche well they came to

384
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:07,858
MIT in the open act project wanting us

385
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:10,729
to build them controlled environment

386
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:14,728
growth chambers so that they can mimic

387
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:18,028
climate anywhere on the planet and test

388
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:20,190
hazelnut cultivars rather than plant

389
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:23,659
them for ten years and need to wait in

390
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:26,970
that native environment so my backyard

391
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:29,849
has the high tunnel with 500 hazelnut

392
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,220
trees in it and my role in the project

393
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:34,769
is to maintain the trees in the

394
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,009
commercial environment prep them for the

395
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:39,450
research that we're doing and then

396
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,729
recycle the trees after individual

397
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,399
experiments next week we're going to

398
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:46,950
start cold temperature freezing Studies

399
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:48,658
on some of these dormant trees the

400
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:52,200
reason that I put the picture up folks

401
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:55,169
this could easily be me setting up a

402
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,359
growing medium for tribal right I could

403
00:19:55,169 --> 00:20:01,159
have five different bags five different

404
00:19:57,358 --> 00:20:04,259
types of growing mixes that I'm going to

405
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,450
test there's a slow release fertilizer

406
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,298
you can see some of the pros mixed in

407
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,989
this could as easily have been a slow

408
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:17,579
release fertilizer trial where each tub

409
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:20,548
of soil had a different rate why conduct

410
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:22,618
on-site child we've talked about some of

411
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:25,918
these performance in your condition side

412
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:29,569
by side product comparisons confirm

413
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,519
product claims see it for yourself

414
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:34,710
other reasons there are number of

415
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:39,239
reasons that we're going to justify

416
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,950
doing product trials who pay attention

417
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:44,278
tips for we mentioned this earlier the

418
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,798
scientific method six steps in beginning

419
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:49,829
we had time I would push you and let you

420
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:53,158
welcome you into form fill out the steps

421
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:55,769
make an observation ask a question form

422
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:59,059
a hypothesis

423
00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:03,479
make an observation climate is changing

424
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:06,799
ask the question is it man-made form a

425
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:09,140
hypothesis is the

426
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,849
burning of fossil fuels contributing to

427
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,800
climate change right the scientific

428
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:17,419
method then design conduct an experiment

429
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,529
analyze interpret the data draw

430
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,060
conclusion it's all very logical my

431
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:26,899
pleasure to take you back to middle

432
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:28,369
school experiment design let's go

433
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,810
through a few of these things very

434
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:35,750
quickly before you as we as we wind down

435
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:38,779
objective treatments design of of the

436
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,029
trial or experiment and then after we

437
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:43,420
execute it we're going to be collecting

438
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:45,740
data interpreting those data and

439
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,930
documenting it coming up with

440
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:51,289
conclusions all right so the objective

441
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:54,259
what do you want to learn before

442
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:57,019
designing before doing anything please

443
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:59,029
think about this answer these questions

444
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:01,609
write them down what do you want to

445
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:04,670
learn it's like Goldilocks don't try to

446
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:08,269
learn too much and try to learn enough

447
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:11,140
so that it's worth the effort write it

448
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:14,569
down you can be save that over and over

449
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:17,630
please write it down because mapping by

450
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:22,279
hand personal device reading Intel

451
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:24,470
device recorded an example determine

452
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:26,359
which cultivar of red leaf MIDI romaine

453
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:30,589
lettuce grows best in my production

454
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:31,939
system that objective that's what too

455
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:35,509
big not too small

456
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,880
this one can sweet raw corn corn there's

457
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:40,869
my box live accident can sweet corn be

458
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,250
grown in a controlled environment system

459
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:46,939
there's a flood drain bench in my

460
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:52,039
greenhouse from last summer by the way

461
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:55,910
why not the MIT project took us down to

462
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,720
NASA two summers ago spent two days with

463
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,679
NASA scientists

464
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:06,000
the workshop and they told us that the

465
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,450
goal is by 2029 or so to land astronauts

466
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,329
on Mars and what blew me away is when

467
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,220
they kind of explained to us the food

468
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:17,158
has to be there on the ground growing

469
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,230
before they even live because we can't

470
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,809
afford to send enough food with them for

471
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:25,019
the trip so all this has to be done

472
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:28,859
robotically before the human even

473
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:30,899
reaches the planet so when I grew the

474
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:33,689
corn in the greenhouse people say that

475
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:35,609
doesn't make any sense I can easily say

476
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,980
that them yeah but you might have some

477
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,658
of our fellow humans on Mars and they

478
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:45,360
might look for a corner in the cob on

479
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:49,950
July 4th in 2030 design huge difference

480
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:52,769
between me a researcher and you a grower

481
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:56,308
the researcher can afford to kill plants

482
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:59,909
the grower cannot you need to straddle

483
00:23:56,308 --> 00:24:02,908
back experiments so when I set up a

484
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:05,429
scientific study as a researcher I can

485
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:07,769
bracket my treatments and include enough

486
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:10,169
of them so that I know some plants are

487
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:13,230
going to die or not perform well and

488
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:18,000
that allows me to create a data set that

489
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:22,019
is very descriptive as a grower you

490
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,970
can't really do that often because you

491
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,538
need to grow that plant sell it for a

492
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,929
profit

493
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:29,398
so throttle back but still that

494
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:32,309
Goldilocks thing and have enough

495
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:35,758
treatments but not too many how many

496
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:41,398
enough to be meaningful not so many to

497
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:44,429
be unmanageable what is the control and

498
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:48,329
why is it important this is the most

499
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:51,370
important segment of a discussion like

500
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:53,869
this what is a control

501
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:56,929
control plant is one that we don't do

502
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:59,059
anything to and it's the plant that

503
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:03,049
we're going to compare everything else

504
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:05,529
back to I've spent 20 years researching

505
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:09,980
their growth hormone ethylene on

506
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:13,099
ornamental crops and the impatience

507
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:16,579
plant on the screen is a single plant in

508
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:19,039
a four inch pot 24 hours before taking

509
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:20,179
this picture the entire plant was in

510
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,599
full bloom

511
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,720
I drew a string across the middle of the

512
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,629
plant sprayed the right hand half a bit

513
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,230
with ethylene and that's a dramatic

514
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:38,830
effect with kind of obsession after 24

515
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,829
hours the control is this side

516
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:45,319
here's a nutrient filled channel

517
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:49,099
experiment using lettuce as the subject

518
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:52,039
from a project a year ago and the

519
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:55,639
project involved different chemistry's

520
00:25:52,039 --> 00:26:00,799
to treat the water to control algae and

521
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:02,509
biofilm and waterborne diseases so we

522
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,329
were looking at different rates and you

523
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:08,450
can see some effects but if I hadn't had

524
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:11,329
the control Vokes what are we going to

525
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,250
compare these different treatments to we

526
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:17,079
can only compare one treatment to

527
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:21,049
another but we have to have that control

528
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:25,609
if I had a dime for every time a Calabro

529
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:28,700
called me and said to me Peter I usually

530
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:32,059
ethylene spray on my hanging baskets I'm

531
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,460
not sure what I'm seeing my first

532
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:37,159
question back to that girl on the phone

533
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:40,130
is always how do the treated plants

534
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,009
compared to the controls and if I had a

535
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:46,400
dime for every time the phone went

536
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:50,059
silent or the comment was I just sprayed

537
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,960
everything well I forgot to vision and I

538
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:54,599
want to make that point

539
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,879
control planet nothing else leaves this

540
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,908
room with you have a good appreciation

541
00:26:56,878 --> 00:27:02,969
for control and I'm always one that says

542
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:06,210
you can have fun with horticulture so we

543
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:08,519
can do all kinds of things I've got two

544
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:12,659
control sections on that plant and to

545
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:15,899
treat it all right with design this is

546
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:18,960
my friend drain system four separate

547
00:27:15,898 --> 00:27:21,868
benches reservoirs four separate pumps

548
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,929
each with a timer that's that's

549
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:27,329
relatively inexpensive and I can look at

550
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:29,730
four different fertilizers if I choose I

551
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:34,109
could look at four different flood

552
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:35,899
depths in cyclic frequencies but I just

553
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:39,569
want to give you a few ideas on

554
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:42,538
Pikeville about setting up trials in a

555
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:45,628
commercial operation this is from an

556
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:49,528
experiment where I was in watering

557
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:52,498
potted plants with different solutions

558
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:55,409
and we didn't have enough plants to

559
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:57,868
warrant an injector and I didn't want to

560
00:27:55,409 --> 00:28:01,230
waste time having the question line an

561
00:27:57,868 --> 00:28:03,839
injector returned I switched the suction

562
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,599
tube to a different solution so in this

563
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:10,678
experiment I simply used tubs with the

564
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:14,148
final solution strengths each tub has a

565
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:17,070
pump and a dedicated hand watering hose

566
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:18,898
so we were able to do four different

567
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:23,308
treatments there's a tub off to the

568
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:26,128
right no just another picture giving you

569
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:28,980
ideas many of you have probably are

570
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:31,439
likely set up your own trials similar to

571
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,470
this seeing someone else's picture

572
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,139
oftentimes increases or raises your

573
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,850
level of confidence

574
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:42,538
here's that nutrient film study again

575
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:46,109
where each treatment channel has a

576
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:47,000
dedicated 5 gallon reservoir a small

577
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:49,789
pump inside

578
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,859
each pumping the water up through the

579
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:54,039
tube and it runs down through the

580
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:56,599
channel if you've seen matric film

581
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:59,000
technique that's what's happening so

582
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:04,039
we're just trickling a thin film down

583
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,319
the channel and the plant roots enjoyed

584
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:09,829
that environment with options of

585
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:13,599
aeration along with the solution again

586
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:16,730
you can see where ten different channels

587
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:20,329
ten different pumps there's maybe three

588
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:25,160
hundred dollars so material here to set

589
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:27,519
up this trial and design it okay a

590
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,570
researcher lives on a small sample set

591
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,859
accurately reflecting an entire

592
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:35,539
population and the night I stay clear of

593
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:38,240
bringing statistics into a talk like

594
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:41,389
this so we're just going to dance around

595
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,319
it a little bit we're relying on a few

596
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:48,470
planets as our subjects to represent the

597
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,990
rest of our greenhouse so we need to be

598
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,559
really careful about how we're handling

599
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:57,079
and treating those subject planets

600
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:00,940
subsets average is everything power of

601
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:04,699
three if you've heard of it and

602
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:07,610
randomization so we don't want to use

603
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,680
one plant a single subject because

604
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:12,740
something might go wrong with that one

605
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:17,210
planet and it's too important a decision

606
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:20,569
to write just one planet if we have to

607
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:22,809
that's better than one but if we have

608
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:26,509
two plants and they respond differently

609
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:30,079
which ones regular as soon as we have

610
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:33,019
the third one magic happens soon as

611
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,629
there's three two of them might group

612
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:38,240
themselves to one side and there might

613
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:39,860
be a third that's an outlier so now we

614
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,500
have the little more our confidence

615
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:45,559
level rises because we have the two

616
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:49,819
planets reacting similarly so it makes

617
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:53,000
sense so always use at least three the

618
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:54,359
more the better but you can't you can't

619
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,220
use too much room

620
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,639
correction facility this is an

621
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,680
experiment that I have going today and

622
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,310
you see three blocks or three different

623
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:09,750
replicants in the picture in the

624
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:14,909
treatment this is a looking at a pulse

625
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:18,539
treatment of water sanitizer so we

626
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:22,950
determined in the earlier trial that

627
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:23,819
continuous exposure to the sanitizer was

628
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,230
phytotoxic

629
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:27,990
remember all those lettuce plants were

630
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,509
smaller than the control so that told us

631
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,029
in the next time let's try a different

632
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:38,460
tactic so we're going to look at a pulse

633
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:42,899
a 30-minute pulse either daily every

634
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,450
other day or weekly so depending on how

635
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,070
this is about I can send that pulse

636
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,340
solution through the appropriate

637
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:52,379
channels the power of three you can see

638
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:56,369
very clearly here each of those headers

639
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:59,310
has three of the tubes so I have three

640
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:02,819
nutrient filled channels for each you

641
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,559
can see randomization here where all of

642
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:09,359
the green are not next to one another

643
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:13,470
mix them up because you might have

644
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:15,259
temperature hot spy or a cool spot you

645
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:20,309
might have like differences so

646
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:21,839
randomization and replication is that

647
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:23,369
enough time spent on those things

648
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:28,289
without putting everybody to sleep with

649
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:30,089
statistics this one I could hit

650
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:35,009
everybody over at head over and over

651
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:38,669
again labeled unless you are have a much

652
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:41,309
better memory than then I do and most of

653
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:44,640
your fellow humans you're not going to

654
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:47,190
remember at the end of a crop cycle what

655
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,490
was done months or weeks before so

656
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,230
please write it down label it

657
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:55,410
experimental control two meanings folks

658
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:56,099
one we've already covered that control

659
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,420
treatment

660
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:02,909
the second is control of the experi

661
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:06,350
if you practice good control that will

662
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:10,560
be uniformity if you have poor control

663
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:12,750
variability variability is an enemy when

664
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,200
we talk about statistics and trying to

665
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:19,410
draw conclusions so number one you want

666
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,380
experiment control treatment number two

667
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:26,040
you want to practice or learn how to

668
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,170
exercise good experimental control for

669
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,509
control introduces experimental error

670
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:33,240
are the differences due to the treatment

671
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:36,089
or other factors because of the poor

672
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,509
control but you want to eliminate those

673
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:41,699
other factors of poor control and have a

674
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:44,750
higher level of confidence that your

675
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,819
differences are due to the treatments

676
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,740
example of growing media trial right

677
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,990
let's let's say you're going to sample

678
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,960
and try three or four different growing

679
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:59,819
mixes are they all going to be on the

680
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:02,160
same trip song if you say yes that's

681
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:05,129
going to be one big mess of experimental

682
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,740
control because likely the reason you're

683
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,450
trying these different mixes is because

684
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,550
they either have better different

685
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,599
aeration properties different water

686
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,750
holding capacity

687
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,000
different nutritional bec profiles and

688
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:21,809
if you're watering them all on the same

689
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,079
zone at the same time one's going to be

690
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:27,360
too wet one might be too dry you might

691
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:30,569
end up at the end with some really cool

692
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,070
differences and say that's the best but

693
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,130
then I'll say to you because of that

694
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:39,929
experimental error that you incorporated

695
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:43,230
that lack of control your confidence may

696
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:46,139
not be very high I'm going to go through

697
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:48,389
this what are you going to measure great

698
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:52,339
once we execute this trial or experiment

699
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:56,019
we have to collect data so with this

700
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:58,059
mini actually that

701
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:02,829
then this slide it might be fresh wait

702
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:04,509
you guys are all about bud wait many

703
00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:06,519
other crops that I work with playing

704
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,020
type number branches member flowers what

705
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,679
are you going to measure it write it

706
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:12,309
down write everything down I've made my

707
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,089
point

708
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:19,029
write it down label it data analysis

709
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:21,039
what do the numbers mean perhaps we can

710
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,450
come back next year and we can talk a

711
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,230
little bit more about some of those

712
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:30,429
details conclusion errors two important

713
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:33,309
points saying something's different when

714
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:37,029
it's not right so you run your trial

715
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:39,630
you're looking at a versus B and you end

716
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,680
up your child says is different than B

717
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:45,610
all right the product things better

718
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:48,219
let's switch but if it's not really true

719
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,780
we're wasting an opportunity right we're

720
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:51,519
gonna switch the product a there's

721
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,119
really no better so we're wasting our

722
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,610
time

723
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,280
the other type of error is saying

724
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:01,030
something's not different when it

725
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,630
actually is right product things the

726
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:06,790
same don't switch well I try all a might

727
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,740
have been designed properly we might

728
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:12,519
have missed it we might not have been

729
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:14,979
able to show product days is any better

730
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:17,019
if that's the case then we missed out on

731
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,760
an opportunity to pick product day

732
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:22,509
because our trial wasn't designed

733
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:26,050
properly all right at the conclusion did

734
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:28,750
you accomplish your objective did you

735
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:33,000
raise more questions please don't be

736
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:36,460
frustrated when this happens excellent

737
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,760
good experiments are designed to answer

738
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:43,030
one question and they will raise new

739
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,600
ones that's the scientific process learn

740
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,030
learn learn

741
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,969
don't ever get tired of learning moving

742
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:53,269
forward to end with this same observer

743
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:55,459
it deserves a second mentioning a good

744
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:56,179
observer doesn't see what he's looking

745
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,690
for

746
00:36:56,179 --> 00:37:03,049
if it's not there and does see what he's

747
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:05,960
not looking for if it is stopped there

748
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,789
Shane oh we yeah we don't seven minutes

749
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,139
for questions please comment your

750
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:09,559
question of being a question raise your

751
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:14,989
hand

752
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:18,529
ringing microphone you know you have a

753
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:18,829
question I'll get one started Peter yes

754
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,850
sir

755
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:25,400
so when you are setting up these these

756
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:28,009
experiments of what kind of thought to

757
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,079
you need to get it into the uniformity

758
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,000
of the equipment that you're using right

759
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,579
some of the photographs that you were

760
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,849
you had showed you know very complex

761
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:39,920
piping systems but but do you need to

762
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:42,440
make sure that everything is the same

763
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,180
Langer has been seeing the same way how

764
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,010
far can you you need to go in your

765
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:48,889
controls now in that category

766
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,350
nice question train though and it's

767
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:53,299
going to depend on on the experiment so

768
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:55,250
let's say I've described to you some

769
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,950
work I'm doing with water treatment

770
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:02,059
algae control biologic you know microbes

771
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:05,239
all that stuff very important there that

772
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:08,570
we're not contaminating from treatment

773
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:11,479
to treatment so flushing lines or making

774
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:14,450
sure that dedicated lines are installed

775
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:18,110
for the trial that's very important if

776
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:20,419
it's a growing medium study well there's

777
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,210
not so much concerned about the delivery

778
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,829
of the irrigation solution but let's say

779
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,550
that the growing medium study is looking

780
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:31,579
at different biological products

781
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:34,100
mycorrhizae other bacteria that might be

782
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:35,840
incorporated into the soil you can see

783
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:36,619
we're on a small scale if you're mixing

784
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,320
in a tub

785
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:41,449
I showed in the picture in between our

786
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,330
shifting from one product to the next

787
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:47,239
you don't want to cross-contaminate that

788
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:50,480
qualifies this experimental error and

789
00:38:47,239 --> 00:39:02,419
loss of control keep going if I haven't

790
00:38:50,480 --> 00:39:04,190
answered in your time trying to do it

791
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:08,889
research in Connecticut what challenges

792
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:08,889
have you find that state where it's not

793
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,570
about the stairs

794
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:23,719
what times have you encountered by

795
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:27,019
trying to do all right I have not yet

796
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:29,569
attempted to research cannabis in

797
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:32,590
Massachusetts we just had recreational

798
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:35,750
passed legislation in a year or so ago i

799
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:44,030
if anyone can help me understand how I

800
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:46,000
get a research that's what I'm waiting

801
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:51,440
for

802
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,929
so I've not yet touched the plant so

803
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,829
this will be our last question what

804
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:56,829
research should be done

805
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:09,159
good question about spectral composition

806
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:12,130
and LED lighting again not anything with

807
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:14,440
cannabis might have been more with leafy

808
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:16,778
greens and colleagues of mine at

809
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,380
Michigan State University Purdue

810
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:22,809
University have published where the

811
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,539
spectra we may have been making a little

812
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:28,450
bit bigger a deal out of it than we're

813
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:31,960
actually the data are actually

814
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:35,699
supporting so I think three years ago

815
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:39,219
around the trade show you saw out of

816
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:42,909
single wavelength of our spectral

817
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:45,249
control today most of its way and we're

818
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:46,748
finding that in a general white LED lamp

819
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:49,268
we get the red the blue and we get a

820
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:52,268
little bit of green so that that's

821
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:55,088
that's doing well some of what we're

822
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:57,568
finding in a lettuce production is red

823
00:40:55,088 --> 00:41:01,630
leaf lettuce that I showed a picture of

824
00:40:57,568 --> 00:41:04,210
spiking the blue as the crop nears the

825
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:06,460
charity triggers some of the

826
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:11,199
pigmentation so that we can have a

827
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:12,999
deeper colored red leaf excellent

828
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,608
question and I think we kind of passed

829
