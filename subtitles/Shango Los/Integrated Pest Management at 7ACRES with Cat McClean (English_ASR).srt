1
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,980
her name yeah good morning to you here

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,019
we go

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,000
so Catherine thank you so much for

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,350
sharing some of your time with me you

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,929
know the reason why I'm so excited to

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,350
talk to you was that yesterday on the

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:24,089
tour here at 7 acres you know you were

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,609
the one of the first people that I met

9
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:29,129
and and you were surrounded by

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,579
beneficial insects and and I'm like ooh

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:35,628
my people all right and and and as you

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,450
you know gave me your part of the tour

13
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:42,979
I realized that you were doing something

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,109
that a lot of other folks in cannabis

15
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:48,538
say they do but in practice they don't

16
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,780
and that's integrated pest management so

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,640
for many folks you ask somebody you know

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,338
what their strategies are for IPM and

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,408
they'll say we spray which is just like

20
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:59,818
one thing or you say what's your

21
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:02,009
integrated pest management they're like

22
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:04,710
oh we use beneficial bugs and that's

23
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,140
just one thing but when I came here

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,709
you're responsible for millions and

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:15,299
millions of dollars of plans and and you

26
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:17,639
showed me a whole array of strategies

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,450
that you use to keep the pest pressure

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,329
down and you integrate them and and I'm

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,390
like oh my gosh this is legit integrated

30
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:28,889
pest management and so I'm really glad

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,530
that you had a little time this morning

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,939
so that maybe you can lay out the

33
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,280
strategy to give folks an idea of what

34
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,949
it looks like scaled and done with a

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,539
proper budget right so so would you

36
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,310
please start with you know kind of just

37
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:47,340
walk us through your strategy for

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:55,289
keeping pests pressure low here at 7

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:58,159
acres so we we do a very integrated

40
00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:01,679
approach so I work with production

41
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,810
sanitation our own department and our

42
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:07,920
focuses more on prevention and not

43
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,899
reaction so we've found over the years

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,860
that the best way to keep our press

45
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,340
pressure down is to not have them in the

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,060
first place

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,759
so we track

48
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,170
we have our scouts they track everything

49
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,269
so if there's a plant alive on our

50
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:27,139
facility one of our trained IPM staff is

51
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:30,850
looking at that plant once a week it's

52
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:33,859
very intensive but we we track

53
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:37,430
everything that could be weird-looking

54
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,880
or Oh what is this and we do it so often

55
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,040
so we can react quickly to any issues

56
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,810
that may arise and I can you know call

57
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,629
one of our suppliers and say I need X

58
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,180
and I have it next week and we don't see

59
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:53,569
anything the week after we also work

60
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,480
with sanitation so they're doing a

61
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:59,810
phenomenal job in this facility and that

62
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,299
is actually the key to a successful IPM

63
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:06,199
program is the cleanliness we're not

64
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:10,100
seeing any recurrence or very minimal

65
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:12,379
reoccurrence of pests in rooms and we

66
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,329
work together very closely it's I don't

67
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:17,870
know what you just switch deer spray to

68
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:20,719
on turnover but it is working please

69
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,329
keep that up we also do formal

70
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,389
monitoring with sticky cards in all our

71
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:28,849
rooms and our beneficial insects is

72
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:32,208
actually the our soldiers on the ground

73
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:36,289
that that are really helping us so it's

74
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:38,840
a very intensive program we receive our

75
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:41,298
bugs on one day and the next day they

76
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,150
are throughout the facilities so in in

77
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:47,719
any given week for insects we're

78
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:51,500
applying 350 to 400 thousand in a flower

79
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,650
room and and they will hunt out all the

80
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,079
all the little bad guys and keep them at

81
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,049
a very very low pressure which is

82
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,150
amazing so let's start at the beginning

83
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,230
and I'll poke a little bit at each of

84
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,090
those okay absolutely

85
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:09,108
so first of all you mentioned your

86
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:12,469
scouting staff right and and I was able

87
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,299
to see it was amazing to find out that

88
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:16,220
all of these analytics and your scouting

89
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,798
team everybody's all connected by

90
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,109
computers and spreadsheets and and when

91
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,239
folks are scouting and they find

92
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:25,009
something wrong with a plant that plant

93
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,329
is marked and it's put on the

94
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,639
spreadsheet and

95
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,378
on a map of the room so you know exactly

96
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,090
where it is so then you can monitor the

97
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:37,550
plants around it I was fully involved

98
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:40,158
what I want my question is though is the

99
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,780
you had all this big color code of all

100
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:44,089
the different things that the scouts are

101
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:46,219
looking for yes and some of those things

102
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:49,609
I didn't even know what they were so

103
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,770
will you give us an idea of the variety

104
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,470
of things that the scouts are scouting

105
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:57,439
for oh absolutely so primarily they're

106
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,229
looking for pest damage it's quite easy

107
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,240
to see fun fact about humans as we can

108
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:04,068
see more shades of green than anything

109
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,189
else so when you're confronted in a room

110
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:09,949
with that many plants it seems like a

111
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:12,500
daunting task but once you do it a few

112
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:13,009
times you actually oh that doesn't look

113
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,319
right

114
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:18,710
what is that and then we'll look and see

115
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:22,819
okay no it's it's nothing or it could be

116
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:25,728
pest damage they're looking for bud rot

117
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:28,669
like mold they're looking at root

118
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:31,278
structures so if we see a plant and the

119
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:32,598
leaves might be a little off-color so

120
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:34,550
you know we're pulling down the root

121
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,408
bags and taking a look and saying okay

122
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,158
well they're okay now what is their

123
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:44,240
damage on there they're looking a whole

124
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:48,879
stalk all the leaves everything which is

125
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,960
it's a lot but they look for that

126
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,990
looking for pretty much anything that

127
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,750
doesn't belong so once once you've been

128
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,150
in in the rooms a few times you you get

129
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,860
to even though every strain it's

130
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:02,778
different you get to know generally what

131
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,569
cannabis looks like so when you see

132
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:08,060
something mm-hmm that doesn't belong and

133
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:10,699
then we jump in and and and figure out

134
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,750
what it is so we look for physical

135
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:17,710
damage harm to the buds pass any for

136
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,750
material that doesn't belong in there

137
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:22,848
the the sheet there the spreadsheet that

138
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,098
you showed me where you were marking off

139
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:26,899
the individual plants they had that long

140
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,089
list on the right-hand side with color

141
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,189
coding how many different categories do

142
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,839
you think there were four four things

143
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:34,189
that the scouts had to check off if I

144
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,998
had to guess I'm guessing there's maybe

145
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:38,370
like fourteen or fifteen categor

146
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:41,580
of the types of damage they're looking

147
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,999
for mm-hmm that's about right it it's

148
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:47,399
anything that could damage the product

149
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:49,830
the final product and we also want to

150
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:54,688
recognize okay is this an isolated

151
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:56,579
incident or is this spreading so if we

152
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,889
find reoccurring instances we have a

153
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,620
number code as well so I can look at

154
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,509
that map and say okay well we found this

155
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,459
on this side of the room and the same

156
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:08,788
thing the next week on this side of the

157
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:12,658
room that might be caused by staff

158
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:14,639
movement in and out of the rows and if

159
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:17,158
we pinpoint something and then we start

160
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,528
seeing it all around okay well this is

161
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:21,538
something that is is spreading from this

162
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:24,689
point so we can go in and make the

163
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:28,978
decision do we is this going to affect

164
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:31,650
our crop do we cut cut the loss and and

165
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:33,810
get rid of the plant or is there a way

166
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:35,848
that we can treat this should I just do

167
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,939
a hot spot treatment and bombard this

168
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:44,938
area with personal s or sworsky or lace

169
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:48,120
wings depending on what it is so even

170
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:51,300
before the scouts are going in and going

171
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:55,110
down this very specific list of things

172
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,939
that they might take off I'm assuming

173
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,968
that just because everybody was in such

174
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,939
heavy gear right that that is probably

175
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:05,278
step one is just to make sure that the

176
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,560
people are not bringing in stuff from

177
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:09,810
the outside then they're not moving it

178
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,228
from room to room so will you give us a

179
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:17,939
like a brief understanding of how the

180
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:20,250
gear we wear and you know the magic

181
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,659
things we're all stepping on let's give

182
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,098
us a little context for what that stuff

183
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:25,800
is doing yeah so everything is

184
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:28,769
controlled it's it's almost like a

185
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,509
research facility tape you wear your

186
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:32,519
street clothes in but then you are

187
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:35,129
issued a clean uniform every day

188
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,509
there's an outside company that loggers

189
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:38,009
them and brings them in I think it's

190
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:39,870
twice a week

191
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,750
so you change into that in our change

192
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,810
rooms you have dedicated shoes for some

193
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,860
to wear all the rooms are and going into

194
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:52,759
the rooms if we have a very set order

195
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,339
that you can go into the rooms so our

196
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:58,110
nursery and our vegetative rooms where

197
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,410
all the production crops are coming from

198
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,750
it's a very set order you can you can go

199
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:05,338
from one to another to another but if

200
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,620
you have to go backwards you're going

201
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,839
out you're taking a shower you're

202
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,389
getting a new uniform interested into

203
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,940
every room you're wearing gloves a

204
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:19,019
hairnet it's more at all times in zone 2

205
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:24,029
even in the hallways and we have we use

206
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:26,039
isopropyl alcohol 70% to clean our

207
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,870
clothes and that's what you get every

208
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,000
room to like yes you showed me around

209
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:33,330
every room it's like present your hands

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,528
present your hands and at first I mean I

211
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,120
have to at the second room I'm like oh

212
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:39,419
no I did that in the other room like

213
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,839
ever and they're like no let's let's do

214
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,509
it again

215
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,190
every room yeah and going in and out we

216
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,720
have food baths for your shoes even

217
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,880
though they're dedicated to zone 2 I

218
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,759
mean it's where there's all kinds of

219
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:53,429
operations and debris so it's I don't

220
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:56,549
they just changed it I believe it's stir

221
00:09:53,429 --> 00:10:00,000
back that's in there now and it just is

222
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:01,859
just way at the bottom of your shoe and

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,350
if there's a room that may have a

224
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:08,039
potential problem in it it's restricted

225
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,870
even more so our tolerance is actually

226
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:14,279
kind of akin to ornamental crop

227
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:17,159
greenhouses in that if we can isolate an

228
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,329
issue to a room it's a very low

229
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,250
occurrence and we will find it in

230
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,790
another room so the staff going in there

231
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,799
have even more procedures to follow so

232
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,870
when they're exiting that room they're

233
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:31,679
taking off their hair net and their

234
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,679
gloves they exit the room we encourage

235
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:37,378
them to not interact with other staff

236
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:40,108
members in the hallway if they have to

237
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:43,139
go into another room shower and change

238
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:44,399
your uniform we go through a lot well

239
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,649
you know that's what I was thinking too

240
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,259
is I really enjoyed the fact that yo

241
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:52,438
don't use Tyvek suits cuz like you know

242
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:55,168
I tore in Tyvek all the time and that

243
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:57,149
stuff gets used once and it's gone and

244
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:59,249
it ends up in a landfill somewhere but I

245
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,769
like the solution here where I didn't

246
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:06,269
see any tie back but everyone was

247
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:08,578
wearing seven acres like I guess they'd

248
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:11,068
consider like golf shirts long sleeve

249
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:13,378
golf shirts and and what are essentially

250
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:14,668
like like sweat pants or like hospital

251
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,658
pants and like a scrub pants which has

252
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:18,568
pockets there you go

253
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:21,359
and so um and you just send those off

254
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:22,438
ahead be washed and come back and and I

255
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:24,509
like that because you know there's

256
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:26,938
already enough environmental degradation

257
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:29,158
from our industry from the light usage

258
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:31,738
and doop tubes and all this other stuff

259
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:33,538
you know being able to at least get rid

260
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:36,269
of Tyvek at least we're going in the

261
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:37,288
right direction right so so let's talk

262
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,459
with my favorite part the bugs just

263
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:41,009
so-so

264
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:44,219
so when it comes to the bugs you know I

265
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:46,168
look at deploying beneficial insects and

266
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,949
predatory mites and two different

267
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:51,899
flavors the first flavor is preventative

268
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:52,918
we don't have a problem today but we

269
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,798
don't want to have a problem tomorrow

270
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:58,558
and then we've got what you're calling

271
00:11:55,798 --> 00:12:02,338
hot spot treatment where okay we need to

272
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:06,088
bombard this area so so what are your

273
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,909
your general bugs for prevention that

274
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:12,779
you go for and and and because you're

275
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:16,009
you want to play defense for particular

276
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:18,418
types of passes we generally use

277
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:20,970
beneficial insects that are poly phages

278
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:24,478
so they eat a variety of things

279
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,290
so we do green lacewing larvae for

280
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:28,050
primarily

281
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:29,458
a fence but I mean they everything so if

282
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:32,159
there's something and it comes across

283
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:34,379
them they're gonna eat it we do have two

284
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,149
sachets that are breeding systems

285
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,189
that'll both extend the life of the

286
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:41,659
mites that are in there so we use for

287
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:46,440
skiing californica for white fly and

288
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:49,429
spider mites respectively that you know

289
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,839
they the sachets are cool and they have

290
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:53,309
on the carrier there's a fungus and

291
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,670
there's actually two kinds of mites in

292
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,849
there

293
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:58,860
they have feeder mites the swierski eat

294
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,889
and little holes and they crawl out but

295
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,149
they'll they'll breed and have eggs so

296
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,100
actually later on today I'll be ripping

297
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,409
open some of ours and seeing if they're

298
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,269
still viable we're get about three weeks

299
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,250
out of them in the in the flower rooms

300
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,389
which is pretty nice and it's good to

301
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,159
point out though when you get the

302
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,629
sachets you know rookies sometimes will

303
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,159
receive the sachets and they're like

304
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,679
ripping him open that's not how they

305
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,600
work you know know if you just looked

306
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,399
for movement you might be seeing a

307
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,100
feeder might you don't know so you need

308
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,578
actually a microscope of some sort or

309
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,649
even a really good hand loop you need

310
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:33,149
about sixty to eighty times

311
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,500
magnification to see the difference

312
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:36,509
because they are very similar in size

313
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,730
but once you see the difference between

314
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:41,458
them it's very obvious that is not what

315
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,190
I'm looking for and we do soil

316
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:47,039
applications to deal with larval stages

317
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:50,250
of well fungus gnats primarily so we do

318
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,019
nematodes and give it to us I can't

319
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:56,028
pronounce the first ones three-eighths

320
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:58,948
ratty only laps hang on it's really good

321
00:13:56,028 --> 00:14:01,500
so it's alright so that is your primary

322
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:04,259
defense team right you're putting those

323
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,470
in on a regular schedule constantly and

324
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,240
heavily because you know what do they

325
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,100
say an ounce of prevention is worth a

326
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,220
pound of cure or something like that and

327
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,350
so but sometimes and you may not have

328
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,939
run into it in this in this facility yet

329
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,440
but but sometimes things fall apart

330
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:26,549
right and and you've got a hot spot and

331
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:32,520
and you've got an invader so so talk us

332
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:34,019
through how your system would show that

333
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,449
how that would show up in your system

334
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,879
and then how you would respond to it we

335
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,350
would find the damage first one of your

336
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,139
Scouts yeah one of the scouts

337
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,090
sometimes even the the guram staff they

338
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,340
they spend a lot of time in the crops

339
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,350
and it's a highlight actually if

340
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,410
everybody is a day they come down to our

341
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:56,460
station we found something weird you see

342
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:59,219
it but it our reaction is pest dependent

343
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:03,030
so our reaction to say a fence is going

344
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,399
to be vastly different from Fritz so it

345
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:09,360
depends on the life cycle of the past

346
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:12,059
how quickly it can multiply what stage

347
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,300
of development the plant is currently at

348
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,549
if it's if it's cooling down and that's

349
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:20,459
gonna slow their lifecycle down I might

350
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:23,879
just go do a beneficial application as a

351
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,850
hot spot so I will reallocate some from

352
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:30,480
another room I run a little extra

353
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,700
everywhere so we have that leeway or I

354
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,379
will call a supplier and say hey I need

355
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:40,480
you know parasitic wasps next

356
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:43,929
because I have this and sometimes it

357
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,460
will be a cult of the plant if it's if

358
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:48,039
the pressure on the plan is bad enough

359
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:50,889
or if it's a certain type of past like

360
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:53,230
we when you have the very quick breeding

361
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:55,689
paths like white flies or aphids their

362
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,430
life cycle if you look at it it's the

363
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,560
definition of exponential growth and

364
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:01,299
that is very hard to control it is

365
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,649
better just to put a plastic bag over

366
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:08,049
that plant cut it down and get it out

367
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:11,709
sometimes an insecticidal soap we will

368
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:14,979
use we try not to spray as much as

369
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,240
possible maybe almost never I think the

370
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:21,490
last time we did a spray was at four

371
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:24,100
months ago and it will it's a call on a

372
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,690
case-by-case basis so if it's something

373
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,730
like a threat or a spider mite and it's

374
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,250
one plant in a room we're gonna heavily

375
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:33,610
do foliate that plant and that I'm gonna

376
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,500
put as many predators as I can on that

377
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,090
plant and all around it and then we will

378
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,389
watch it over the next two weeks and

379
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,100
make sure that it hasn't record if if

380
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,319
there's multiple cases in a room I'm

381
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,320
gonna status that room and you know

382
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,540
people going in and out are very very

383
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,760
limited and that way it won't spread to

384
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:53,740
the rest of the facility I wish I wish

385
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,629
you had wasps in one of the rooms went

386
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,340
on when I was on tour yesterday cuz

387
00:16:55,629 --> 00:17:01,149
that's really cool I've only ever seen

388
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,920
them you know in books and in theory

389
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,920
right you know I we've got we've got

390
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:08,019
lots of lots of different types of wasps

391
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,400
on Vashon Island where I live and I

392
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:11,799
understand that not involve more

393
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,810
stinging and you know there's a lot you

394
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,690
know not all lost or threats right most

395
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:19,059
are our friends and Aaron and pollinator

396
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:21,460
allies right but then when I was going

397
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:23,379
through you know beneficial insects and

398
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,850
learning for the first time like five or

399
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,830
six years ago and I saw that there were

400
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:29,349
wasps I'm like who the hell is gonna let

401
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,879
wasps go in their grow and then as you

402
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:33,669
read about them they're like you're like

403
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,610
wow that's really cool it just feels it

404
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,230
feels extreme did you run into when you

405
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:41,769
know when you're getting the staff used

406
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:46,179
to coexisting with wasps in the room

407
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:49,720
did you have to convince anybody it's an

408
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:52,300
explanation definitely because like that

409
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,839
you hear wasp and what but the ones that

410
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:58,319
we use are parasitic so if we need to

411
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:01,240
those actually lost for great for

412
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:03,909
reaction and less so for prevention so

413
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,470
you you need that pest in order for them

414
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:11,259
to survive and and be viable as a as a

415
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,269
beneficial insect in your crop if you

416
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:16,450
don't it's better just not to use it and

417
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:18,940
use a mite instead but if you have to

418
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,340
bring them in you you let everybody know

419
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,620
these are specific they're they don't

420
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:26,439
have stingers as you know them they're

421
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:29,500
not a bumble bee or a wasp they're not

422
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,110
gonna hurt you they're attacking the if

423
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,670
it's like an aphid they're gonna attack

424
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:36,279
that aphid and what they're doing is

425
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,700
they're injecting their eggs in there

426
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:42,190
and then it hatches and it's they're not

427
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,150
gonna hurt you they aren't gonna fly at

428
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:48,759
you and they do get stuck on our sticky

429
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,350
cards but it it's one of those it

430
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:52,900
they're really great if you have an

431
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:56,379
issue just try to get one in there

432
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,350
because they're they're top notch as a

433
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:03,640
reaction well so so I know it's seven

434
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:05,949
acres you have a blend of cultivators

435
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,420
right some folks have cultivated

436
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,670
cannabis in the past and there's

437
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,558
straight-up heritage growers but also

438
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,808
there's some people that you bring in

439
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,389
and you train them up over the course of

440
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:20,950
a couple years to be really good

441
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:23,440
cultivator folk on the team right is

442
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,360
there and I know I didn't I didn't warn

443
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,120
you I bought this ahead of time so is

444
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:33,519
there any particular incorrect

445
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,349
expectation that you get from the the

446
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,829
people who have already got growing

447
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:40,719
experience about doing integrated pest

448
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:42,669
management that you're finding is pretty

449
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,429
common and you often need to train out

450
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,590
of folks spraying spraying is your per

451
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:49,710
minute

452
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:56,039
that is the go-to and it's been a go-to

453
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:59,279
for decades and it's it's a different

454
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:01,980
approach in that we will have some and

455
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:05,329
we will use it if we want to but it we

456
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:08,849
want the cleanest product possible so

457
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:10,919
for spraying it's very time consuming it

458
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:16,169
disrupts all our operations especially

459
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:18,509
at this scale and it is awful I don't I

460
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:22,410
don't like doing it the team some of

461
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:26,579
them are ok but it I would much rather

462
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:30,929
not do that but that that one is a big

463
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:33,269
one and it's a lot of so integrated pest

464
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:36,929
management especially cannabis is very

465
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:39,359
it's a new concept so it's a lot of

466
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:41,429
trying to explain oh yeah you are

467
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,949
finding these you know a cricket or

468
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:46,019
something in in a hallway I would like

469
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,460
to know about that because then the next

470
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,700
couple days I'm crawling around on the

471
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,970
floor looking for the hole and one of

472
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,269
the other big ones is you're not ever

473
00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:01,410
going to be pest free ever that that is

474
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:04,950
wholly unrealistic but you take measures

475
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:07,769
to keep it at such a level that it's

476
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,950
manageable for you and it's not going to

477
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:15,119
cause any kind of economic loss and the

478
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:19,558
more vigilant you are tracking that type

479
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:22,049
of those types of things you can part of

480
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:24,329
my coming nip it in the bud right before

481
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,349
it gets to a problem yeah so you're not

482
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:28,710
going to be able to get rid of all of

483
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:30,240
them but keep them lonely yes you keep

484
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,470
them very lonely and they don't know

485
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,579
what to do no chances are you know our

486
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,980
place we might come up and just eat it

487
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:40,230
everybody yeah well Katherine thank you

488
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,390
so much for your time of in your joy

489
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,120
