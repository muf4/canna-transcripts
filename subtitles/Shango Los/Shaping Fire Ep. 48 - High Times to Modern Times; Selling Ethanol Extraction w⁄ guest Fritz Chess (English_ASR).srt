2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:09,240
as cannabis freedom spread around the US

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,910
and the world

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,919
new shiny and expensive brands are being

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,079
established to conduct the commerce of

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,000
the cannabis industry and even though

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,038
there's a huge amount of business risk

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,660
to opening a cannabis company the

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,609
likelihood that you might catch a case

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,740
and go to prison is greatly reduced

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,390
though we should pause for a moment to

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,129
remember that people are still very much

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,489
going to jail for the plant and that

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,019
needs to stop immediately everywhere but

15
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,699
in states with at least a medical

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,960
cannabis program you can usually run

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,489
your cannabis business within the

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,039
regulatory structure without getting

19
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:43,439
busted that was certainly not always the

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,238
case folks who have come to cannabis in

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,829
the last decade or so kind of always

22
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,959
have had the expectation that it would

23
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,210
be legal in the next few years but as

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,878
recently as the 1990s you could go to

25
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,759
very real prison for not a lot of weed

26
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,558
and there was no end in sight and yet

27
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,049
there have always been those who were

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,909
studying breeding conducting science and

29
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,489
inventing devices for the cultivation

30
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,920
and processing of cannabis plants this

31
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,140
global fellowship of botanical experts

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,969
developed specialty knowledge and traded

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,010
it amongst themselves while staying in

34
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,890
the shadows and just out of reach of the

35
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,810
muggles if you want to learn about

Shango lows today my guess is frits

59
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,930
chess Fritz's founder of Eden labs maker

60
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,450
of some of the most advanced and relied

61
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,009
upon cannabis extraction technology we

62
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,140
won't really be talking tech with frits

63
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,479
today nor really about the modern Eden

64
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,619
labs company I invited frits to talk

65
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,810
about the early days

66
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,819
of selling extraction technology in the

67
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,530
back of High Times Magazine and what

68
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,658
hurdles he had to cross trying to

69
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,628
develop extraction tech and connect with

70
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:26,340
customers welcome to the show fritz

71
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:27,329
Thank You Shango glad to be here yeah so

72
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,890
glad that you share some of your

73
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,890
valuable time with us let's get right to

74
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,169
it so when you were first selling

75
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:36,479
ethanol extraction equipment it was in

76
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:38,609
the back of High Times Magazine and in

77
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,189
those days cannabis of course was still

78
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,099
very much illegal and yet and yet High

79
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:47,219
Times was exerting pressure against

80
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:49,979
prohibition simply by existing so I'm

81
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,689
curious to what degree did it feel like

82
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:52,949
you were getting away with something

83
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,560
illegal

84
00:02:52,949 --> 00:03:01,018
being able to advertise your ethanol

85
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,158
extractors in the magazine well we

86
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,780
definitely felt like we were getting

87
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,739
away with something because here's how

88
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,739
it all happened

89
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:13,439
you know before before us and Eden labs

90
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,530
they way back in the 70s there was the

91
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,109
ISO 2 extractor it was made by a guy

92
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,629
named DJ Gould so I want to give him

93
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:25,709
some some props first of all but second

94
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:28,409
of all we studied what happened with him

95
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:32,219
and you know he was openly advertising

96
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:34,109
it as a way of extracting cannabis and

97
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,539
peyote buttons were two of his main

98
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:41,700
focuses and so the DEA shut him down

99
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:44,638
fairly quick and we talked to a lawyer

100
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:47,759
and basically he said you have to have a

101
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,680
disclaimer that that it's not for

102
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,439
illegal use so we turned that into a

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,569
tongue-in-cheek marketing pitch so the

104
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,269
picture in High Times showed our

105
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,280
original little coldfinger home unit and

106
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,500
up at the top it said warning not

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,150
intended for illegal use which was a

108
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,039
roundabout way of saying hey you can

109
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,079
make a coil with this thing yeah and

110
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:11,159
everybody got it and they started

111
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,829
selling pretty well right away and none

112
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,598
of this was my idea I had a friend

113
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,150
someone I'm still good friends with who

114
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,548
already was selling he he was the one

115
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,620
that developed the products for passing

116
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:26,098
the urine tests company called clear

117
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,560
choice and he approached me first he

118
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:30,529
asked me for one of these extract

119
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,480
because you know he knew I had one and I

120
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:34,519
made him one and then he said you know

121
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,020
if he can you make these I can sell them

122
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,180
and I'm like yeah I can make them and

123
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:40,099
and I was like you think there's a

124
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,569
market for herbal extractors and he said

125
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,310
well let's find out and so he had me

126
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,349
make 10 of them and he put that ad in

127
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,300
and you know there was no looking back

128
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,810
they immediately started selling really

129
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,790
well

130
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,889
yeah no surprise there I mean that

131
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,919
technology probably blew people's minds

132
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:57,860
that that it was gonna be so easy to to

133
00:04:54,918 --> 00:05:01,310
extract oil do you remember how much the

134
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,169
original price point was I think that

135
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,740
little home unit sold for like a hundred

136
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:10,069
and fifty dollars back then and the one

137
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,300
unit we still make now that we came out

138
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,120
with shortly after the home you know we

139
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,290
call it the professional six litre you

140
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,540
know it started out at nine hundred

141
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,419
dollars it's it's thirty six hundred now

142
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,939
I mean glass glass and glass blowers

143
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:24,469
pricing has gone way way up and I never

144
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,560
really was marking it up quite enough

145
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,120
back then to begin with so so your buddy

146
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,250
comes to you and he says hey you've got

147
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,019
these extractors let's see if there's a

148
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,120
market forum why did you have the

149
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,189
extractor already I mean were you were

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,660
you making these in your garage like R&amp;D

151
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,719
style because you were doing your own

152
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,789
extractions or were you already in a

153
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,940
related business but you just weren't

154
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:49,339
selling to cannabis folk so what

155
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:51,918
actually started the company I mean I

156
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,929
was I was making various kinds of herbal

157
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,579
extracts and including cannabis but

158
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,370
basically just the super old-school

159
00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:00,228
method of grinding some herb putting it

160
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,939
in a jar you know like a spaghetti jar

161
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:04,519
or something and with alcohol or vodka

162
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:09,740
and shaking it up and straining it off

163
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:13,099
in a funnel and you know cooking out the

164
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,728
alcohol I had like a crude still that I

165
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,460
used and so yeah I just made them for

166
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:21,829
myself and the reason I started making

167
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:23,959
extractors is because the one herb I

168
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:25,849
wanted to work with kava kava was

169
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,519
extremely difficult to extract it would

170
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:31,850
just not extract putting it in jars of

171
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,889
you know ethanol or vodka and so I came

172
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,050
up with this distillation method and and

173
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,519
that worked really well for the kava and

174
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,110
so there wouldn't even be in Eden labs

175
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,419
if it wasn't for kava kava because

176
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,639
cannabis was easy you know you just put

177
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,860
a jar with some alcohol and shake it up

178
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,569
and of course we didn't realize how easy

179
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,270
it was back then you know we were still

180
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,769
shaking it for days on end when really

181
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:53,299
all I had to do was pour it in there and

182
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:55,879
shake it up you know was pretty much

183
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,189
done so so what year are we talking

184
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:03,230
about here

185
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:05,990
1994 1994 right on so so you know High

186
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,660
Times Magazine has always been kind of

187
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,509
like you know counterculture bastion and

188
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:15,280
they provide a lot of cover for a lot of

189
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:20,259
folks with their own legal department

190
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:23,209
was was high times very open to you know

191
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:25,969
you know kind of sharing that umbrella

192
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:28,629
protection that was provided by their by

193
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,490
their legal team for a certain extent or

194
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:35,000
were they very much you know we're

195
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,340
giving you a place to market your mostly

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,990
illegal goods so you really owe us like

197
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:41,209
I guess I'm trying to get at you know

198
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,620
were they easy to work with back in the

199
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:46,939
day were they were they trying to

200
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,500
encourage your sales um well first of

201
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:51,019
all I didn't deal with high times it was

202
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,430
it was that friend Leigh the Dodd who he

203
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,469
was the one that marketed those through

204
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,250
high times so I was wholesaling him to

205
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:00,890
him I did have you know a web site very

206
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,870
early on I think by 96 I had a web site

207
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:05,389
and we were selling them here and there

208
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,959
but that was mostly kava industry in the

209
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:13,399
kava it really was a you know a hot herb

210
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,349
yeah in the mid in late 90s and so I was

211
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,989
mostly dealing with kava stuff Laith was

212
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,879
handling the cannabis but I think High

213
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,009
Times was pretty easy for him to get

214
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,850
along with because he was doing giant

215
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:28,219
full-page ads they they they like people

216
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,620
who are making their money but one thing

217
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,290
they wouldn't do is you know we kept

218
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,840
badgering them to do an article about

219
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,009
our extractors and they just wouldn't do

220
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,830
it and I think it was because a

221
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:45,559
liability and what happened with DJ gold

222
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:46,400
back in the 70s but eventually crap I

223
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,089
can't think of his name

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:53,360
Oh ed Rosenthal eventually Edie called

225
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,800
me outside you know of High Times having

226
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,320
nothing to do with High Times and he

227
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,929
what we call the four liter apothecary

228
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,550
in which we still sell and and then he

229
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,649
and I went over on the phone like you

230
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:05,870
know I taught him how to carbon filter

231
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:08,330
to get the green out and you know so ed

232
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:13,310
was using it that was in the 90s like

233
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:17,899
probably 96 so you know you must have

234
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:21,649
been pretty excited / startled when the

235
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:24,019
ad ran and then the order started coming

236
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,958
in work did were they like jumping out

237
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:31,970
of your workshop as as soon as the ad

238
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:36,588
ran well I mean the ad was in there

239
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:39,589
every month probably from 96 til Bush

240
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,870
got elected and I shut it down I said we

241
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,890
can't be advertising and had high times

242
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,539
with this new regime which actually you

243
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:49,850
know Michael Kennedy who owned High

244
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:52,309
Times I talked to him maybe five years

245
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,409
ago and a cannabis cup and he told me

246
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:56,929
that I did the right thing because a lot

247
00:09:54,409 --> 00:10:01,629
of people you know got raided real quick

248
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:05,509
once they started that operation I

249
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:06,889
forget what it was yeah yeah I can't

250
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,480
think of the name but it was operation

251
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,610
something or other where they were

252
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,039
raiding everybody that was advertising

253
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,839
in High Times and so I feel like I got

254
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,778
out of there in the nick of time yeah

255
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,120
that sounds like a smart place so before

256
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:22,480
you got out I would have thought that

257
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,528
the you know those of you who were

258
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,709
advertising and High Times were kind of

259
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:29,539
like in a secret Club right because you

260
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:32,000
know there was pretty much nowhere else

261
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:35,360
in the country that you could get away

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,879
with advertising like that and all of

263
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,919
you were in it you know selling items

264
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:43,100
that were for example for tobacco use

265
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:45,469
only or or as year as yours was you know

266
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,440
definitely not for illegal cannabis

267
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,269
extraction it kind of I would think it

268
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,579
set up like a set a secret club of you

269
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:54,769
folks who were who were doing this did

270
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:57,049
you did was there camaraderie between

271
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,789
the advertisers who were who were

272
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:00,789
pulling this hustle or were you all just

273
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:03,500
kind of like working in your own worlds

274
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:05,360
well Lafe probably knew a lot more of

275
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,328
those people than I did I only knew one

276
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,759
guy and he was actually in Columbus Ohio

277
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:13,669
I lived at the time and he sold you know

278
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,278
glass pipes and bongs and he didn't pull

279
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:18,860
his ad and they came after him he barely

280
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:21,548
escaped and he went to Taiwan and he

281
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,769
didn't come back to lo bahama collected

282
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:27,139
so so so it's interesting that you'd say

283
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:31,489
okay we probably pulled our ad right as

284
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:32,959
the bush regime came in it's it's odd

285
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,939
though that they did not go to old

286
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,719
issues and find your ad and then raid

287
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:38,599
you that's that

288
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:45,769
did you ever get contacted at all by law

289
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:48,889
enforcement at any time um late Laith

290
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:50,928
had a he had something some kind of

291
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:55,879
inquiry from the DEA at one point

292
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:56,958
because someone got raided but you know

293
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,019
they didn't really give him a hard time

294
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,308
they just I don't remember you know was

295
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,028
back in the 90s I don't remember exactly

296
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:07,610
what they wanted to know but it was but

297
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:09,078
it was pretty innocuous I was kind of

298
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,199
surprised they didn't they didn't make

299
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:14,138
any big deal about it at all so you were

300
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:18,828
you were doing these other extractions

301
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:22,009
kava-kava and and other things were any

302
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:24,409
of your other extractions you know

303
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,749
potentially running into legal issue as

304
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:30,019
well like like you mentioned DJ gold was

305
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:31,909
doing peyote button extraction and we're

306
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,068
you know kava kava is legal even though

307
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:35,988
you know it certainly has got some I

308
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:38,568
don't know what's called medical

309
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:40,699
properties but were you extracting other

310
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:45,019
controlled substances as well or just

311
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:46,338
cannabis well yeah there were lots of

312
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,220
things I don't I don't really want to go

313
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:50,720
into all of that but you know let your

314
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,459
imagination run wild

315
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,910
sure sure where I was going with that

316
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:59,198
though is you know we imagine that there

317
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:02,539
is kind of like an international club of

318
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:05,508
people who are experts in their field

319
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:08,678
and and it sounds like at that time you

320
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:11,480
were probably an expert in the field

321
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:13,789
certainly on the forefront of it and I

322
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,769
wondered if other people from you know

323
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:17,448
who are developing their own extractors

324
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,448
are from other countries who are trying

325
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:21,589
to solve extraction problems was the you

326
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:24,199
know in an Internet

327
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,970
world this all became very very easy for

328
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,040
us right but in the in those days you

329
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,889
had to you know either write letters or

330
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,659
travel to each other did people reach

331
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:35,500
out to you because they wanted to

332
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:38,809
connect with you for your expertise oh

333
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,740
sure and you know and when it came to to

334
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:44,869
cannabis there was you know before Bush

335
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,799
when Clinton was still president I would

336
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,649
say that San Francisco was the epicenter

337
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,809
of the whole you know cannabis

338
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:56,720
processing and new cannabis innovation

339
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:58,759
and we put we put all kinds of

340
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,830
extractors and not the very first

341
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:04,159
dispensary that was Dennis Peron and his

342
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,720
didn't last too long but the very second

343
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,839
one was on Market Street in San

344
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,410
Francisco and you know that was the

345
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,560
second dispensary and we had you know an

346
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:17,919
older version of the ethanol extractor

347
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:21,589
distiller that we sell to this day and

348
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,929
my very first co2 unit that we ever

349
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,930
built he rented it for a little while

350
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:28,370
and we used it there and that was the

351
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:30,649
first time I'd ever put you know good

352
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,750
quality product and I you know in Ohio

353
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:35,569
basically I'd give people to give me

354
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,879
bags of leaf and you know obviously it

355
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,280
wasn't as good of quality is what came

356
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:43,580
out from primo buds coming down to the

357
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,439
bay from humble we're people even

358
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,389
thinking about doing whole plant

359
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,950
extractions at that point I mean in in

360
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,019
my mind and certainly I don't I don't go

361
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:54,259
back as far as you do but in my mind

362
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:56,720
you'll people have just been using trim

363
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:59,539
for extraction until just about you know

364
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,850
four or five years ago when when the

365
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:04,039
prices dropped and people realized how

366
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,500
much better extractions were from from

367
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,360
you know doing nug runs versus doing

368
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,789
trim runs where did you actually have

369
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,240
people back in the in the mid late 90s

370
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:17,480
who were doing full flower runs we did

371
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,850
full flower in the co2 unit at that at

372
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,110
that shop and on Market Street I don't

373
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:25,639
remember what the name of it was but

374
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,230
typically you know everybody was just

375
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,830
doing you know sometimes it wasn't even

376
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:33,110
trim it was just like fan leaves yeah

377
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:35,420
and you know obviously it was pretty low

378
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,639
quality stuff and nobody knew what wax

379
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:39,979
were and there was no analytics none of

380
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,470
that existed but I did figure out how to

381
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,970
carbon filter early on and you know at

382
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,470
least getting the chlorophyll out that

383
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,670
was a big innovation at that time

384
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,970
because I don't know if you've ever

385
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:52,969
smoked that old-school Jamaican hash oil

386
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,649
that was blackish green but who yeah

387
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,210
Matt you can imagine what that tasted

388
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,949
like yeah that stuff was really bitter

389
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,600
because there were so many fan leads

390
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,610
right so you're getting you're getting a

391
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,259
lot of other stuff actually it got my

392
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:08,419
attention when you said that you you

393
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:10,399
taught ed how to filter through carbon

394
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:11,839
to get rid of the chlorophyll that would

395
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,449
clean up a lot of people's product right

396
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,340
there well that was a major step right

397
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,440
there and you know it wasn't for some

398
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,810
years later that we realized that we

399
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,640
could drop waxes out just you know when

400
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:25,699
it came out of the coldfinger extractor

401
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,500
it was a tincture and you have to carbon

402
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,330
filter first get rid of chlorophyll for

403
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,549
some reason wax won't drop out when

404
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,440
they're still chlorophyll in there but

405
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:35,539
you know then we we figured out after a

406
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,860
while the you know part of it was us

407
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:39,919
figuring it out and there were other

408
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,000
people and we figured out we could just

409
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,860
put that in the freezer for a little

410
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,100
while and drop that wax out and really

411
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,500
bring out the flavor a lot better mm-hmm

412
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,120
so at this time you know you were

413
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,779
working with your business partner and

414
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,580
you were feeding him extractors to sell

415
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,829
through the magazine and but you were

416
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:01,250
also having these other extractors for

417
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:04,009
various other herbs were you you know

418
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,690
where you take were you going to trade

419
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:07,430
shows clearly they weren't cannabis

420
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,160
trade shows yet but did you go to

421
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:13,250
herbalist trade shows and and you were

422
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,460
bringing this gear out yeah the Natural

423
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:19,579
Products show which is in Anaheim every

424
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:22,309
March we've said we used to do that show

425
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,569
a lot so you probably know where I'm

426
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,569
going with this when you're at these

427
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:28,339
shows there are probably people who who

428
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,349
you know maybe they were doing lavender

429
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,480
for their business but at home they had

430
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,399
a little home grow what did you get

431
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,920
people coming up to you at the shows

432
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,380
with a nod nod wink wink could this be

433
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,890
used for other things and and you had to

434
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:45,740
be very careful with that yeah we were

435
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:47,720
pretty discreet about it probably not as

436
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,009
much when Clinton was president I didn't

437
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,419
worry about it too much

438
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:53,900
I mean obviously it was a lot more

439
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:55,910
careful than now but when when when Bush

440
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,460
got elected it was Don't Ask Don't Tell

441
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,140
I mean if if someone we it was real

442
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,600
typical back then for someone from

443
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,220
California to call up and just start

444
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,889
running their mouths basically say it's

445
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,960
legal here where you know we're licensed

446
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,990
we can we can do this and they'd start

447
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,769
talking about and I'd say now it's you

448
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,359
know I'm in Ohio it's federally illegal

449
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:19,910
you know if you were calling me up I'd

450
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,099
hint strongly I'd say like if you were

451
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,830
calling me up about extracting some

452
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:27,469
ginseng I'd be happy to talk to you but

453
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:29,269
I can't help you you know with the

454
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,360
cannabis right so I mean it was

455
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:34,609
basically like duh you know don't be

456
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,048
stupid you know maybe you want to call

457
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:37,548
me back and you know I'm pretty sure

458
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,259
some of them did but yeah it was

459
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:43,009
definitely a Don't Ask Don't Tell policy

460
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:44,569
till basically till after Obama got

461
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:47,359
elected and Holder had that press

462
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:50,539
conference in 2010 then then you know

463
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,279
the Pandora's Box opened sure that

464
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:53,899
reminds me a lot of back when I was in

465
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,519
college and we would go to head shops

466
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,220
and you know the signs would save for

467
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,259
tobacco use only and so you'd be asking

468
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,440
for something and you had to be very

469
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:05,929
careful what you asked the the employees

470
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,750
for because if you used any of their key

471
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,820
words they'd say sorry you have to go

472
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,099
you know and they'd get and they get

473
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:15,710
real shitty about it - yeah totally is

474
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:16,909
throw you out right cuz you're put that

475
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,519
you know they were you were putting them

476
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,769
at risk and pissing them off so so yeah

477
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,190
that's kind of interesting so people

478
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:27,740
think of those little glass bowls with

479
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,509
the stem off as a crack pipe but really

480
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,279
they were a hash oil pipe this you know

481
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:33,558
crack didn't come out to the early 80s

482
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,450
but there was always the hash oil pipes

483
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,639
in the head shops you know they they

484
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:43,190
weren't common but I had to tell people

485
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:45,590
to ask for the tobacco oil pipe and

486
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,200
which was a new phrase but most of the

487
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:50,209
head shops got it right away because

488
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,970
there'd always been the like I said that

489
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,890
nasty Jamaican hash oil that came around

490
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,509
you know starting way back in the 70s

491
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,030
and then there were a few people you

492
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:00,859
know making hash oil with DJ gold's

493
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:02,329
instruments so I'm trying to picture

494
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:03,889
this utensil that you're just

495
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:06,918
driving it was it was it kind of like a

496
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,870
glass spoon that you would light with a

497
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,669
butane lighter from the bottom so that

498
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,889
the flame did not actually come into

499
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:15,528
contact with the hash yeah so it was

500
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,538
more like a glass fishbowl with an open

501
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:19,579
hole in the top and a stem that came off

502
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:21,019
and so you drip the oil down in there

503
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:23,720
and then you'd hold a lighter to the

504
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,548
underside and smoke it you know the same

505
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,589
way people smoked crap exactly like I

506
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:29,179
said it's not really a crack pipe it was

507
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:33,859
it was an oil pipe that's where it all

508
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:37,038
started right on so so when you would go

509
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:39,979
to these trade shows and you were

510
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,339
selling to these these other types of

511
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:46,130
herbalists did you find that you started

512
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:49,250
selling these to people who were using

513
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,769
them for cannabis more than you were

514
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,919
selling them to people for regular herbs

515
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm trying to get an idea of of how many

516
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,870
people may or how significant the number

517
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,110
of people who were buying your product

518
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:06,918
for its cannabis purpose versus you know

519
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:10,250
a traditional herbal purpose well one of

520
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,919
my original sponsors our backers was a

521
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,259
guy here in Seattle who you know he was

522
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,200
a big kava importer of course going back

523
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:21,319
to that and so he was in the natural

524
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,028
products industry and he was friends I'd

525
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,158
never met people like this you know

526
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:27,589
hippies that were multi-millionaire

527
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:30,380
businesspeople and and most of that

528
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:32,778
those those natural product companies or

529
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,210
herbal companies you know were started

530
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:37,609
with the proceeds from you know cannabis

531
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:41,179
importation so all of these guys were

532
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:42,888
super familiar and they all got high but

533
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:46,460
you know their businesses were selling

534
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:48,469
medicinal herbs and so yeah all his

535
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,120
friends bought these units and I'm

536
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,970
pretty sure they were mostly just doing

537
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,739
hash I with it but you know people were

538
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,048
kind of secretive back then and they

539
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,849
didn't know me so I didn't hear a whole

540
00:21:57,048 --> 00:22:00,349
lot about it but yeah that was my

541
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:01,969
impression yeah that was actually a

542
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:04,250
pretty nice setup you had where you got

543
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:07,038
to build the machine which was your

544
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,099
passion and then and then have your your

545
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,629
friend be more the face of the company

546
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:13,629
which gave you an extra level of

547
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,070
security while you were still able to

548
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,778
you know not only make the profit

549
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:20,358
but have your hand and the cannabis

550
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:22,700
scene which you know even though it was

551
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:24,949
dangerous there it's also was a you know

552
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,269
kind of a rite of passage to be a bit of

553
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,100
an outlaw back in the day and that's

554
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:30,739
cool

555
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:33,019
yeah yeah everything you said is true

556
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:36,950
and getting back to to the culture and

557
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:39,470
you know people reaching out by the time

558
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,798
Bush got elected the whole epicenter

559
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:45,979
shifted to Vancouver and that same

560
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:48,618
friend had a condo in Vancouver so he

561
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:51,259
and I got kind of initiated into the the

562
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:53,178
VIP area upstairs above Blount Brothers

563
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:55,220
I don't know if anybody listening is

564
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,139
going to remember Blount Brothers but it

565
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,558
was a it was kind of an Amsterdam style

566
00:22:57,138 --> 00:23:02,209
coffee shop in Vancouver back then and

567
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:05,470
you could smoke in there and they had

568
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,840
coffee and sandwiches and so upstairs

569
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,690
was kind of where you know the

570
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:14,058
Illuminati of the cannabis industry

571
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,580
often hung out and so I was meeting big

572
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:18,798
growers and exporters and importers and

573
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:21,168
people that were innovating you know

574
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,999
with extractions and stuff that was you

575
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:27,409
know the early 2000s or you know from

576
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:29,929
from basically from like 99 on and then

577
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:32,179
they got Stephen Harper and we got Obama

578
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:34,070
so everything shifted back to here yeah

579
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:35,809
right on so I'm gonna ask you more

580
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:37,700

country good people with smart

658
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:18,500
backgrounds still are making the mistake

659
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:20,599
of building without knowing cannabis and

660
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,069
it causes them to burn through capital

661
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,139
and time fast

662
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:26,450
everyone has their filmed failure point

663
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,040
for some it is improper ventilation

664
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,630
planning for others it is surface

665
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,359
temperatures of the building or the

666
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,830
plants leaves or both some folks that

667
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:35,839
build their greenhouse from scratch make

668
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:37,699
really basic errors like placement of

669
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,959
the greenhouse on the property or not

670
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,670
understanding the natural environment

671
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,308
where the greenhouse sits

672
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,048
some have even built a decent greenhouse

673
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:46,548
but our inefficient in their deployment

674
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:48,849
of light deprivation techniques and

675
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:51,200
never really hit their target yields

676
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:53,058
it's great when you learn from your

677
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,190
mistakes but it's even better when you

678
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:57,378
learn from the mistakes of others when

679
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,058
you bring on green house advisory group

680
00:26:57,378 --> 00:27:00,949
you will learn from the mistakes of

681
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:02,569
their many clients and you'll take

682
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,759
advantage of the best practices

683
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:06,769

684

you from location development to

welcome back you are listening to

694
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,649
shaping fire I'm your host Shango Louis

695
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,649
and our guest this week is fritz Ches

696
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:35,628
founder of Eden labs so before the break

697
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:38,178
we were talking about the early days of

698
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:40,459
Eden labs and advertising in High Times

699
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:42,590
Magazine and what it was like to be

700
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,808
selling an extractor that could be used

701
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:47,240
for cannabis during serious Prohibition

702
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:49,128
days well then things started

703
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,710
transitioning with the Obama

704
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:54,709
administration and and the laws started

705
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:56,808
loosening up Dennis Peron was running

706
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,028
the cannabis buyers club on market which

707
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:02,329
luckily I was able to check out there in

708
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:04,819
1996 and and and people were starting to

709
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:08,359
understand that cannabis had legitimate

710
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:10,819
medical uses and and things started to

711
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,829
loosen up at least for people who you

712
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:16,308
know we're HIV positive and for people

713
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:17,778
who wanted to do R&amp;D so so before the

714
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:21,019
break Fritz you were talking about how

715
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:23,269
above Blunt Brothers in Vancouver the

716
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:27,019
the International cannabis Illuminati

717
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:30,138
were able to get together and talk you

718
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:32,509
know safely and bluntly and and and

719
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:34,849
exchange information in ways that we

720
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:37,128
take for granted now due to the internet

721
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:39,648
but in those days you actually still had

722
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:42,558
to physically get together you know as

723
00:28:39,648 --> 00:28:45,018
somebody who was and you know an

724
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:47,118
extraction engineer like yourself and

725
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:49,940
you're meeting these international

726
00:28:47,118 --> 00:28:53,000
cannabis players did folks start to

727
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,759
consult you or you know try to recruit

728
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,970
you to for example go to Amsterdam and

729
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,529
build out machines

730
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:03,029
something were people trying to to

731
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:05,700
involve your expertise well there was a

732
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:08,250
lot of talk of me moving to Vancouver

733
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,569
and setting up an operation there and I

734
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:14,400
actually came very close to doing that I

735
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:16,139
think the only the only reason it didn't

736
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,019
happen because all of a sudden I got a a

737
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,750
giant project building multiple co2

738
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,490
extractors for some scientists down in

739
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,259
California and that just kind of kept me

740
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,609
in Ohio and then one thing led to

741
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:29,308
another I never did move to Vancouver

742
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:30,000
but yeah it was at one point it was all

743
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:31,740
arranged

744
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,038
I had growers that were gonna give me

745
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,720
trim I had a place to set up you know I

746
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,879
had blunt brothers that it was all gonna

747
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,190
move through so yeah I was I came very

748
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,789
close to moving to Vancouver just being

749
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:47,519
one of the earliest you know large-scale

750
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:48,960
actual makers it sounds like even though

751
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,690
you weren't actually making the oil

752
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,450
yourself it sounds like you still even

753
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,548
though you moved back to the US you were

754
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,048
still a very serious player you weren't

755
00:29:56,548 --> 00:29:59,369
actually just doing the production you

756
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:01,048
were actually creating the means of

757
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:02,250
production though just because you moved

758
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,599
that act to the United States doesn't

759
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,019
mean that you gave up your hand on the

760
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,490
game no I was doing then what I'm doing

761
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:11,548
now is you know I run the R&amp;D department

762
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,079
at Eaton labs and that's kind of what I

763
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:15,359
was doing so I was always doing

764
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:19,259
extractions and trying new stuff but I

765
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:23,069
wasn't doing you know toll processing

766
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:24,538
for people so to speak so as kind of a

767
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:26,960
sidebar I want to talk about the

768
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:31,079
vocabulary that's been used historically

769
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,750
you know nowadays a lot of people like

770
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,668
to use the term eh Oh ethanol hash oil

771
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,429
but but a lot of people don't even know

772
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:40,830
what ethyl eh-oh is and so most of us

773
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:43,259
still use the shorthand for RSO Rick

774
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:46,470
Simpson oil just because people know

775
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:48,929
what that means and and even though Rick

776
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,190
Simpson wasn't the person who first did

777
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:52,650
these types of extractions he's

778
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:56,070
certainly one of the people who made it

779
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:58,919
more popular so so going back to the the

780
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:01,230
the early to mid-90s when you were

781
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,288
bringing these first extractors to

782
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:09,240
market what was the vocabulary people

783
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:11,940
were using to refer to a a clean

784
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,609
essentially a hash oil and and how did

785
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:18,390
you see if at all that vocabulary change

786
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:20,159
over the years well it was just simply

787
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,720
called hash oil and there weren't a lot

788
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,490
of options are a lot it you know there

789
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,980
weren't all the different manifestations

790
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:28,799
or varieties that you have now I mean

791
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,509
there was almost all alcohol extracts

792
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,549
that were carbon filtered and just put

793
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:35,279
in little vials and you know in the

794
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:37,109
early days the main market was deadheads

795
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,420
nobody else was interested in hash out

796
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:40,949
the deadhead community and though those

797
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,680
who traveled following the dead they

798
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:47,250
loved it

799
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:49,289
you know the BHO came along very soon

800
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,150
after I started doing the cold fingers

801
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:53,369
that was kind of really that was really

802
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,940
start I don't know who invented it but

803
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:58,409
the guys who popularized it was a

804
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:01,680
silicide fanatic is that were down out

805
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:05,100
of Olympia and they they developed the

806
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,250
easy method of growing shrooms and they

807
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:11,189
had the original you know BHO you know

808
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,710
blaster units that they they sold out of

809
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,269
high times but you know they didn't last

810
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,120
all that long because not only were they

811
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:19,950
advertising you know those things out of

812
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,139
high times but they were making mass

813
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,660
amounts of hash oil and growing many

814
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,090
many pounds of shrooms openly and they

815
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,640
got in a lot of trouble and they might

816
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:31,379
still be in prison I'm not sure that's

817
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,200
interesting that the first units that

818
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,900
were being sold were were open blasting

819
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,970
and and not closed-loop at all I mean my

820
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,970
god talk about a dangerous product in

821
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,559
the wrong hands jeez yeah and of course

822
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:46,259
there was there was them and then the

823
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,049
honey bee came out which I think oddly

824
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:50,640
is still around but the honey bee was

825
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:52,680
kind of the main instrument that people

826
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,630
started you know buying to do hash oil

827
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,450
you know you saw those and had shops way

828
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,920
back in the 90s so with it with the name

829
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,809
of that product being the honey bee it

830
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,930
kind of speaks back to my question about

831
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:06,720
vocabulary was was the term honey oil

832
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:13,980
being used to refer to the the ethanol

833
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:16,350
hash oil as well yeah it was and there

834
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,710
were people who argued that point way

835
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:22,740
back then because the honey oil was was

836
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:27,960
supposed to be really top notch

837
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:30,778
and honestly the the best hi show I ever

838
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,350
saw like way back in the day it was

839
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:38,609
crazy I knew this guy in college who got

840
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:41,459
on a plane flute in Nepal but tons of

841
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:44,339
hash oil stuffed it in condoms swallowed

842
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,110
him came back to campus you know you can

843
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,089
you know how he got him back out yeah

844
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:49,439
and then that stuff was all over campus

845
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:52,470
for like a month and it was this

846
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,600
beautiful pinkish red color and then I'm

847
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,970
pretty sure it was actually extracted

848
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,849
from high-quality hash probably with

849
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,140
ether which is you know an older method

850
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:03,480
that I don't think too many people do

851
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,710
anymore but that was the true that was

852
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,740
the true honey oil you weren't gonna

853
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:11,010
make a product like that extracting fan

854
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,230
leaves with ethanol yeah yeah that's for

855
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:15,450
sure and that that person who flew to

856
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:19,829
Nepal was probably a superhero on campus

857
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:23,668
there for a while well it obviously had

858
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:25,289
a big influence on me yeah when when you

859
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:27,569
can when you can get the the oil

860
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:29,398
straight and not have to smoke the plant

861
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,720
material as well it's a it's a really

862
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:32,159
different experience and it's

863
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,888
interesting too that you would mention

864
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,679
that the the oil kind of traveled with

865
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:40,378
deadhead family too I'm a I'm a deadhead

866
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,168
and followed they're in the you know the

867
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:46,139
mid-90s for a few years and that's the

868
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:48,509
only place that I ever saw it and so you

869
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,280
know when we toured you would run into

870
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,129
it in the parking lot pretty regularly

871
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,530
but where I went to school in

872
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:57,960
Indianapolis at Butler University it

873
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:01,019
only ever you you only ever really saw

874
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,570
it in Indianapolis in my circles anyway

875
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:05,338
was right after shows at Deer Creek

876
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,530
right so everybody would go to the shows

877
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:08,909
and and you'd buy some and then you'd

878
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:11,369
have it and then you know it was all

879
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:13,289
gone in two weeks but if but if you paid

880
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,088
attention like when the Dead came

881
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:17,429
through town you could get some of these

882
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:19,799
exotic things like like California kind

883
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:21,779
buds right right back in the back in

884
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,609
those days we were all smoked in Mexican

885
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,260
brick weed right but the stuff would

886
00:35:23,608 --> 00:35:27,989
come from California and then eventually

887
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,700
became BC bud and out I mean that was

888
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:32,338
exotic stuff but it was cuz it was

889
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:35,608
traveling with heads right exactly

890
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,599
so probably I mean some of that hash oil

891
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:40,679
you might have gotten

892
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:44,339
dear Creek would be from guys I knew who

893
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:45,839
down in Athens at Ohio University and a

894
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,809
lot of that stuff would would get

895
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,150
unloaded at dead shows it at Buckeye

896
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:55,199
Lake yeah I've seen some good shows

897
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:58,550
there too yeah so do you think that it

898
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:02,219
traveled with the deadheads because the

899
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:06,090
parking lot market was so easy to work

900
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:08,539
in because the the heads were so happy

901
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:12,030
to buy it or because the extractors

902
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:15,539
themselves were dead heads yeah I think

903
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,340
it was a little bit of both but it just

904
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,279
seemed like the dead heads were hip to

905
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,380
it real early on and liked it and they

906
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,290
appreciated you know how high had got

907
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,760
them one of my tricks back in the early

908
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:29,940
days before anybody even knew what this

909
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,800
stuff was is I you know I'd put the oil

910
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,960
on the inside of a rolling paper and

911
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,450
roll up just a joint of you know Mexican

912
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,099
because that was what was around and you

913
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:39,929
know ten people would get high on that

914
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:43,380
Joe and they'd be just like what in the

915
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:45,359
world was that but they you know they

916
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,430
didn't even know what hash oil was and

917
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,880
you know they might want to get a little

918
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:52,710
vial of it but yeah back then I always

919
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,070
wondered why aren't people more into

920
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:58,590
extracts probably just sheer lack of

921
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:05,789
availability what was the price point

922
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:07,260
like on that stuff I think you know I

923
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:09,779
saw anywhere from twenty to fifty

924
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,930
dollars a gram back then and that would

925
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,830
have been you know just extracted from

926
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:18,899
trimmer leaf carbon filter ethanol

927
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:20,789
removed but you know obviously plenty of

928
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,650
parts per million but you know there

929
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:25,019
were no analytics and they'd just be in

930
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:27,690
the little glass files it's interesting

931
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:30,480
that the the price point has stayed

932
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,519
essentially the same and what has gotten

933
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,559
better is the quality but but the price

934
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:40,199
point is about the same it is yeah so um

935
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:42,690
let's see here so let's uh kind of as a

936
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,929
side note you know a lot of people when

937
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:49,010
they're talking about RS oh they'll talk

938
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:50,659
about how Rick Simpson popularized it

939
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:53,360
but that you really didn't want to use

940
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:55,909
his method because he encouraged the use

941
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:59,030
of naphtha and you were in the scene

942
00:37:55,909 --> 00:38:01,369
before Rick was popularized and you're

943
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,650
in the scene after Rick was popularized

944
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:07,460
do you have anything to share about what

945
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:10,400
it was like to be there as the as Rick

946
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,750
and his method became popularized and

947
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,210
then and then people started to move

948
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,659
away from it because of the naphtha and

949
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:19,340
choosing ethanol you know if you you

950
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:21,710
were there so if you have any stories

951
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,650
I'd love to hear it yeah I have a short

952
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:28,730
story I mean he called me probably you

953
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:31,150
know 99 or 2000 or I don't know exactly

954
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:34,400
but about you know back around then and

955
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:36,590
I kind of admonished him for pushing the

956
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,000
snaps a thing and told him he should be

957
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:42,650
using ethanol and I'm not sure what

958
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,300
happened after that but it was you know

959
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:49,070
not too long after that that everybody

960
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:50,690
called ethanol extract RSO but to my

961
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,820
knowledge he was if you watched his

962
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:56,630
videos he was still promoting naphtha

963
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,670
not ethanol but I I don't know exactly

964
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,309
you know what the story was with him but

965
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,409
I you know Maya my knowledge was it was

966
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:06,739
always naphtha but somehow ethanol

967
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:08,589
extract it came our s so maybe you can

968
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:11,179
maybe you know more about it than I do

969
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,820
yeah I actually I actually don't I mean

970
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:16,250
all I know is just you know second

971
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,950
fourth fifth hand that you know the

972
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:22,309
naphtha was popularized because it was a

973
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:23,929
a good solvent and it was available and

974
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:27,259
you just had to make sure that you

975
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:29,629
purged it properly but then that that

976
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,760
skill and that equipment was so much

977
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,559
harder to get that people just naturally

978
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,660
moved to ethanol because it was easier

979
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,039
to get at but sure you know I I don't

980
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:40,639
know if that is accurate it just so much

981
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,800
safer right right exactly much safer so

982
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,069
to finish up on the kind of

983
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,560
international Illuminati thing had you I

984
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:51,140
mean other than going to Vancouver which

985
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,480
is certainly another country had you

986
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:56,359
started traveling internationally at

987
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:59,150
this point to meet with other you know

988
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:02,420
mines in Amsterdam to talk about

989
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:05,150
technology and processes

990
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,010
I never did go to Amsterdam now my

991
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,139
partner you know at the time that I've

992
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,690
talked about lathe he went to Amsterdam

993
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:15,159
on a number of occasions and of course

994
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:17,568
I've been friends with Donny wertshafter

995
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,578
I'm guessing you know who he is

996
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:22,400
oh yeah sure absolutely yeah so you know

997
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:25,280
he and I are both from Ohio and you know

998
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,230
he has that that permaculture preserved

999
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,030
down in Belize I've hung out down there

1000
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,190
with him for like a month in the jungle

1001
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:33,440
and you know I've known him from

1002
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:37,309
environmental activism since I was you

1003
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,769
know in my late 20s and so I the main

1004
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:41,780
person I kept in touch with about what

1005
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:44,869
was a scene was and where it was going

1006
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,760
was Donnie because I just see him in

1007
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:49,280
Columbus bouncing around town we had we

1008
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,440
had all the same friends and he really I

1009
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,630
mean he really does have a great rolodex

1010
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,858
of international connections I mean he

1011
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,809
would have to have that just to be able

1012
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:59,179
to pull together a lot of the artifacts

1013
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:03,079
that he keeps yeah of course yeah

1014
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:05,779
nobody's more connected than Don yeah so

1015
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:07,400
so right on so let's go ahead and take

1016
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,190
our second break and then when we come

1017
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,470
back let's talk about that you believe

1018
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,750
that the changing of the guard and and

1019
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:17,389
the the eventual decrease of prohibition

1020
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,500
so yeah so we're gonna take our short

1021
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:20,328
break and be right back you're listening

1022
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,139
to shaping fire and my guest today is

1023
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:25,849
fritz chest founder of Eden labs as a

1024
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:27,679
listener of shaping fire you already

1025
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:29,780
understand the importance of living soil

1026
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,489
when growing cannabis when you have

1027
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,559
active microbe communities in your

1028
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:35,598
substrate you go way beyond simply

1029
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,359
fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and

1030
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,338
potassium having active microorganisms

1031
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:42,170
in your substrate supports vigorous

1032
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:44,000
plant growth throughout the plants root

1033
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,789
zone making for higher yields and

1034
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,949
thriving flowers mammoth pea is the

1035
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:49,579
first organically derived microbial

1036
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:51,618
inoculant

1037
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:53,780
that focuses on your plants nutrient

1038
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:55,849
cycling processes to release soil

1039
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,650
phosphorus and other micronutrients from

1040
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:00,530
they're bound forms making them more

1041
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:02,269
available to the plant increased levels

1042
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,400
of phosphorus will also keep internode

1043
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,829
shorter and focus your plants energy on

1044
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,869
bud production not only that but the

1045
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:09,920
microbes act as a defense shield for the

1046

plants rhizosphere

1047
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,630
by out competing potentially harmful

1048
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:16,069
pathogenic microbes pretty cool right

1049
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,079
mammoth pee not only

1050
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,380
the nutrients in your soil but it also

1051
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,090
helps protect your plant from disease

1052
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,039
mammoth Peas beneficial bacteria act

1053
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,440
like microbial reactors

1054
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,869
continually producing enzymes that

1055
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,760
release nutrients mammoth pee was

1056
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:34,009
developed at a u.s. university has been

1057
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,350
extensively tested by Colorado growers

1058
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,780
and independent laboratories mammoth pee

1059
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:40,969
is proven to increase growth and enhance

1060
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,980
blooming one of the great things about

1061
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:44,269
supplementing with microorganisms is

1062
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,860
that they won't compete with whatever

1063
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:48,320
fertilizer program you're already

1064
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,940
running simply dose on top of your

1065
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,250
fertilizer schedule for increased

1066
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,900
benefits to learn more and to find out

guest this week is fritz Ches

1104
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,369
founder of Eden labs so before the break

1105
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:22,000
we were just coming up to the changing

1106
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:25,699
of the vibe in the United States where

1107
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,929
you know people were surviving the

1108
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:29,969
Republican administration

1109
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:32,969
everyone had scurried back underground

1110
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:35,250
after the Clinton years but that you

1111
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:37,679
know change was coming with the with the

1112
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:40,440
Obama administration and Dennis Peron

1113
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:42,839
was making massive changes in California

1114
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,300
and people were starting to see cannabis

1115
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:48,420
in a slightly different light than they

1116
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,769
did with the reefer madness so so so

1117
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,630
frits you know there there must have

1118
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:54,139
been a point for you

1119
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:57,570
after President Obama came into office

1120
00:44:54,139 --> 00:45:01,559
where you're all like okay things have

1121
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:05,519
changed we can start to expand our

1122
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:07,710
services and and change our messaging a

1123
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:11,610
little bit to reach out to new people

1124
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:13,619
what was that point for you well it

1125
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,200
happened very suddenly and kind of

1126
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:19,469
unexpectedly I mean Holder had that

1127
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:21,119
press conference I think in 2010 where

1128
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,799
he said we're gonna let States do what

1129
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,349
they want to do and I certainly took

1130
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,080
note of that but I had no idea how

1131
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:31,259
significant that moment was but what

1132
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,659
happened was Eden labs had had built a

1133
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,740
fish oil extractor in particular it was

1134
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:39,389
extracting you know omega-3 oils from

1135
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:41,639
Greenland New Zealand muscles and these

1136
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:43,739
two New Zealand brothers you know had

1137
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:46,079
this company down in Orange County in

1138
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:48,929
California and we had been setting up

1139
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,789
that extractor and when we finished my

1140
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:53,009
buddy Fred and I just decided to go to

1141
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:56,039
Venice Beach for a few days and you know

1142
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:59,040
party have fun and when we got up there

1143
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:00,269
we were just shocked because it was you

1144
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,570
know right after that press conference

1145
00:46:00,269 --> 00:46:05,130
but the response was dramatic I mean

1146
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,920
they were giant billboards everywhere

1147
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,900
with pot leaves on it people were just

1148
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,430
smoking everywhere I mean everywhere you

1149
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,130
walked around the boardwalk you could

1150
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:15,719
smell it they had you know attractive

1151
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:18,869
women in bikinis and rollerblades

1152
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:21,269
selling medical marijuana cards you know

1153
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:24,389
right there by Muscle Beach it was crazy

1154
00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:26,099
and back then my cell phone was the

1155
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:28,469
phone number for Eden labs and it

1156
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,089
literally when we got to Venice Beach my

1157
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:32,609
phone just started ringing like crazy

1158
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,680
and we've never looked back I mean

1159
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:38,640
that's when it really took off was at

1160
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:40,109
that moment so when so how fast so like

1161
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,038
so holders talked so would you say that

1162
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,559
with

1163
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:48,630
a week your phone started to blow up was

1164
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:50,699
it that fast um I would say it probably

1165
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,890
even the next day it started to ring

1166
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:56,309
more for that and we decided pretty

1167
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:59,998
quick that it was okay to talk about it

1168
00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:02,219
now that you know what we're allowed to

1169
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:06,149
do and say has always been an evolving

1170
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:08,479
process but you know we quickly segwayed

1171
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:12,209
away from the Don't Ask Don't Tell and

1172
00:47:08,478 --> 00:47:13,978
you know started start we it wasn't a

1173
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:15,778
lot of direct marketing but certainly

1174
00:47:13,978 --> 00:47:17,639
they come to the website and they call

1175
00:47:15,778 --> 00:47:21,119
or email and we we talk about it openly

1176
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:23,489
and and up until that point everybody

1177
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,160
had just been buying our coldfinger

1178
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:27,749
you know ethanol distiller extractors to

1179
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,808
make oil but it

1180
00:47:27,748 --> 00:47:32,639
coinciding with holders press conference

1181
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:36,209
was all of a sudden everybody wanted co2

1182
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:38,489
extractors and we just you know we went

1183
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:41,578
from building one two or three a year to

1184
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:43,708
building you know three a month five a

1185
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:44,880
month all right so that that brings up

1186
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:47,879
two different questions for me the first

1187
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,159
one is is that okay so if if you know

1188
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,989
holder makes his statement and you are

1189
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:58,798
immediately getting you know calls your

1190
00:47:54,989 --> 00:48:02,818
pivot was from talking about other herbs

1191
00:47:58,798 --> 00:48:05,458
and inferring cannabis did you pivot to

1192
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:07,858
a medical at the time we would call it

1193
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:10,528
medical marijuana language and you were

1194
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:12,869
using medical marijuana language or were

1195
00:48:10,528 --> 00:48:14,568
you still not quite up you know still

1196
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:17,219
not up to being that blunt about it

1197
00:48:14,568 --> 00:48:19,798
we're pretty blunt about it and we did

1198
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:22,229
talk about it you know mostly in medical

1199
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:23,579
terms for the most part I mean going by

1200
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:25,768
you know Dennis you remember Dennis

1201
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:28,259
perón's for sure state statement that

1202
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:31,708
all all cannabis use is medical we kind

1203
00:48:28,259 --> 00:48:34,048
of went with that philosophy so in

1204
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:36,088
addition to though your your idea that

1205
00:48:34,048 --> 00:48:37,949
you are you were safer because of

1206
00:48:36,088 --> 00:48:40,528
holders statement at this point you know

1207
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:43,619
you're making some money and and you are

1208
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:45,568
about to start to scale for real for the

1209
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:48,568
what will become the you know commercial

1210
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:52,829
cannabis industry were you you know did

1211
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:54,960
you were you lawyer DUP at this point um

1212
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:57,269
yes we we had a

1213
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,179
had a great lawyer back then the best

1214
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:01,889
and he unfortunately he he had like a

1215
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:05,460
stroker and aneurysm in the middle of

1216
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:08,369
the night probably 2011 and then he was

1217
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,230
no longer with us but Ian was fantastic

1218
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:12,420
and he had great ideas for how to

1219
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:13,139
navigate all of this and it all worked

1220
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,170
out just fine

1221
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:18,389
we never nothing ever happened you know

1222
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,369
for us to regret right on that's good

1223
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:21,569
and you know it's nice too because the

1224
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:24,239
reason why I wanted to ask that is

1225
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:25,590
because you know it's it's always nice

1226
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:29,250
for us to make decisions on our

1227
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:31,380
intuition and how we think the politics

1228
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:33,960
is going based on what the media is

1229
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:37,590
telling us but at the same time have a

1230
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,929
lawyer yeah yeah we had a great one yeah

1231
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,640
excellent so so I want to shift gears a

1232
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:45,599
little bit and talk a little bit about

1233
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:47,400
the tech itself and so you know you had

1234
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,549
the original coldfinger

1235
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,590
back there in the in the early to mid

1236
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,210
90s and is actually making me happy to

1237
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,530
hear that it's like the same name you

1238
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:57,389
know cuz you still have the cold finger

1239
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:00,269
on your website right I'm sure that it's

1240
00:49:57,389 --> 00:50:01,769
evolved over the years but you know this

1241
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:04,739
was this was like one of your original

1242
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:06,630
kids if you will yeah I'd like to give

1243
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:08,969
you the floor and just like here you

1244
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:12,150
describe how the state of the art of

1245
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:15,359
ethanol extraction has evolved from your

1246
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:18,180
early days to where it is now and I know

1247
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,800
that this might be a long answer but but

1248
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:22,440
I would think that everybody would like

1249
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,570
to hear it especially the the extractors

1250
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,220
who are bothering to listen and you know

1251
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,110
if you go over my head that's perfectly

1252
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:29,879
cool but but you know if somebody were

1253
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:32,370
to ask you from your from your early

1254
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,860
coldfinger machines to the ethanol

1255
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:36,989
extractors that you're selling now what

1256
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:39,480
are the what are the main themes of

1257
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:42,959
evolution in the technology that you've

1258
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:47,400
developed well of course the big switch

1259
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,349
was realizing how efficiently cannabis

1260
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,030
extracted with ultra cold ethanol that

1261
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:53,250
you know there's a very rapid extraction

1262
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:55,800
and you know if you do it right with

1263
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:57,599
cold you don't pull the wax you pull

1264
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,190
very little or no chlorophyll depending

1265
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,489
on you know what you're working with

1266
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:04,950
none of us knew that back then I mean my

1267
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:06,539
joke back then when it was you know

1268
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:08,909
trying to make a cup of tea with cold

1269
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:10,800
water you know I always believed

1270
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:14,009
did you know chemists in general all

1271
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,070
believe that you know the solvent needed

1272
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:19,860
to at least be room temperature or warm

1273
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:21,750
and you know it was it with a warmer the

1274
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,700
it was the better it was going to work

1275
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,949
and you know generally that's that's

1276
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:27,149
true but in the case of cannabis it just

1277
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:30,929
means you're going to pull a lot of wax

1278
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:32,579
and chlorophyll so you know the original

1279
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:34,679
extraction you're going back to the

1280
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:36,659
Jamaica thing I always figured the way

1281
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:38,759
they made that was they just throw a

1282
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:42,629
bunch of cannabis and a big pot out in

1283
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:45,390
the woods and and you know heat it with

1284
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:46,829
a fire and within a bunch of rum and you

1285
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:48,719
know I was in Jamaica a few years ago

1286
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:51,869
and these guys confirm that that's how

1287
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:55,219
they did it so going from that you know

1288
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:57,929
the cold finger was able to distill

1289
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:59,669
redistill the same ethanol through a

1290
00:51:57,929 --> 00:52:02,759
basket of Arab over and over again so

1291
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:04,920
you got a much more concentrated batch

1292
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,350
right out of the beginning and then you

1293
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,659
could you could switch it out and put in

1294
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:12,000
a collection vessel and then distill the

1295
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:15,569
ethanol back out of it all in one

1296
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,010
machine so that was pretty evolved for

1297
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:19,289
the time and you know that's still a

1298
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:21,780
very useful method I mean to this day we

1299
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:23,759
have contracts making that kava kava for

1300
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,380
people and that's still the best method

1301
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,570
for that because it's very exhaustive

1302
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:32,220
and kava is very difficult to extract

1303
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:34,950
but obviously that's overkill for

1304
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:38,609
cannabis and you know I laugh about how

1305
00:52:34,949 --> 00:52:40,079
long we went not realizing that you know

1306
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:42,090
we'd have this little unit just

1307
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,639
distilling and distilling for hours on

1308
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:46,320
end and watching the drips come out of

1309
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,809
the basket and wait til they ran clear

1310
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,460
before we figured it was done and you

1311
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:52,860
know in reality it was probably done in

1312
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:55,760
the first 10 or 20 minutes and after

1313
00:52:52,860 --> 00:53:00,480
that we were just going hours and hours

1314
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:03,020
wax in chlorophyll but you know we

1315
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:07,019
eventually that was figured out and and

1316
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:09,090
the very earliest that I knew of doing

1317
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:11,159
anything cold was actually you know

1318
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:13,800
there were guys up in Canada in that VIP

1319
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:16,170
room at Blood Brothers but they talked

1320
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,920
about doing it was it was never ethanol

1321
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:22,019
it was cold isopropyl and and I did that

1322
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,829
and it worked I just did not like the

1323
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:25,199
idea of use and I

1324
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:27,509
a propyl anymore than I liked the idea

1325
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,189
of using naphtha so we were very close

1326
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:33,120
to having this all figured out and like

1327
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:34,650
you know 1999 but it was a you know we

1328
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,109
thought you had to do it cold with

1329
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:39,570
isopropyl not ethanol so we kind of

1330
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:42,990
missed the boat and you know another 15

1331
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:44,850
years went by or something like that so

1332
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:46,649
obviously you know in the last couple

1333
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:51,380
years the cold ethanol thing is really

1334
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:54,329
caught on and so the way we do it now is

1335
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:56,340
you know we kill a big chamber of

1336
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:58,289
ethanol with a chiller or you can

1337
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,390
jump-start it just throwing dry ice in

1338
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:01,949
there and then we pump that and just

1339
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:04,889
spray it over a bass it kind of like a

1340
00:54:01,949 --> 00:54:07,139
giant coffee maker and then recirculate

1341
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:10,379
it for a little while and then pump it

1342
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:13,500
off and you know we don't pull any we

1343
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:16,500
don't pull any wax and if you're if

1344
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,119
you're content to not grind it first you

1345
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,920
won't pull any chlorophyll either but

1346
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:21,329
that means you only get 30 pounds of

1347
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,400
that basket if you grind it you can get

1348
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:24,900
70 pounds and then you're gonna pull a

1349
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,329
little bit of chlorophyll but you know

1350
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,559
we have these a really efficient and you

1351
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:30,630
know a lot of people listening or

1352
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,759
familiar with the lenticular filters and

1353
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:34,200
the plate filters and you can just pump

1354
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,910
everything out of the extractor right

1355
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:38,009
through that filter and it comes out you

1356
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:40,679
know real pretty on the other side so

1357
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:43,620
pull out a little chlorophyll is not a

1358
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:45,179
problem the wax has always been the

1359
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:47,489
problem once everybody realized they

1360
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:50,549
wanted to get that out and you know

1361
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:55,529
we're still trying to improve the tech

1362
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:57,510
on that because coal cooling giant you

1363
00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:00,120
know hundred gallon or 500 gallon

1364
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:02,910
chambers of ethanol down a minus 40 C or

1365
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,369
colder that's time consuming it's very

1366
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:08,219
expensive for the the chillers it's very

1367
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:10,289
expensive on your electric bill so the

1368
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:12,149
Holy Grail now is to just be able to do

1369
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:14,039
this at room temperature ethanol you

1370
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:17,220
don't have to put any cold or heat on it

1371
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,230
and then be able to get that wax out

1372
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:21,899
with some kind of refining system that's

1373
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:24,329
a lot more efficient than having to

1374
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,190
chill everything and we're working with

1375
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:28,409
some of the biggest refining and

1376
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,690
filtration companies that work in food

1377
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:34,349
and chemical process we've got like four

1378
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:36,039
different projects going at once right

1379
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:40,539
now

1380
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:42,670
and we're seeing promise with a few of

1381
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:44,949
them but we we haven't really hit on

1382
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:47,860
anything yet that's that's gonna

1383
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:49,599
eliminate the need for those chillers so

1384
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,640
it's interesting that you said that you

1385
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,380
know back in the day things were being

1386
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:56,650
done at room temperature and then things

1387
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,390
got really cold but to make the cost

1388
00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:01,090
savings here you're trying to figure out

1389
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:03,489
a way to move back to room temperature

1390
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:06,160
but then filter after the fact my

1391
00:56:03,489 --> 00:56:08,349
question for you is when doing it at

1392
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,750
room temperature you get a you get a

1393
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:12,940
darker product that many have called you

1394
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:15,159
know green lion or green dragon right

1395
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:20,320
yeah and so and then and then that

1396
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:24,639
evolved to you know using cold alcohol

1397
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:28,240
in the freezer and and the the water in

1398
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:31,269
the actual frozen flower material tends

1399
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:33,159
to stay in the flower material when it's

1400
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:35,800
all frozen and so you're adding you know

1401
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:39,009
you know freezing temperatures alcohol

1402
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:41,170
to actually frozen flower and and gonna

1403
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:43,180
do you know a couple quick rinses off of

1404
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:46,210
it and and then you end up with this

1405
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:49,089
more of a this beautiful amber golden

1406
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:51,159
tincture instead of the like kind of you

1407
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:54,010
know what I now feel like is kind of the

1408
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:57,699
scary and bitter green dragon kind of

1409
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:59,290
material when when it moved when the

1410
00:56:57,699 --> 00:57:02,739
tincture pro or when the when the

1411
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:04,750
extraction process moved to the cold did

1412
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:07,239
that really get rid of a lot of the need

1413
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:09,269
for the the carbon filter at the end

1414
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:13,359
because there was so much less

1415
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:16,090
chlorophyll in that product yeah

1416
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:18,010
depending on how you do it now oh yeah

1417
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:20,110
like you said if you can freeze the

1418
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:23,500
cannabis along with getting the ethanol

1419
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:26,579
cold that's an ideal way to do it but

1420
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:30,909
now that people are scaling up to huge

1421
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:33,519
volumes especially with hemp very few

1422
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:36,879
people are actually freezing the

1423
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:38,380
cannabis first they're just taking the

1424
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,340
cannabis and they're getting the ethanol

1425
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:44,559
cold so it's you know it still does a

1426
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:47,050
much better job than you know warm or

1427
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,779
room temperature ethanol but to avoid

1428
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:52,360
chlorophyll completely with a and not

1429
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:55,210
cool the cannabis you basically have to

1430
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,340
not grind it just put whole buds in the

1431
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:59,289
basket and then you know spray that

1432
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:02,320
ethanol over it and that that still

1433
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:05,320
comes out you know a nice golden color

1434
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,690
how does using whole flower decrease

1435
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:09,400
your yield I would think that a lot of

1436
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:12,210
your trichomes would be tucked on the

1437
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,260
interior of an unground flower

1438
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:17,079
well it certainly washes all the

1439
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:19,300
trichomes off which is you know 70 or 80

1440
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:22,179
percent of it but there is that there's

1441
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:25,060
those cannabinoids that are bound in a

1442
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:27,639
matrix of cellulose and wax down in the

1443
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:31,929
plant material and that's that's always

1444
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:33,969
more stubborn to get out but the price

1445
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:35,500
of cannabis has dropped and so abundant

1446
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:37,750
that a lot of times people don't care

1447
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:41,010
about good yields anymore they just want

1448
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:43,840
good product yeah good product in an

1449
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:46,630
efficient scalable manufacturing process

1450
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,190
yeah so so I've got a question before

1451
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:52,329
you that I get asked all the time you

1452
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:55,960
know people ask me how how how much THC

1453
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:57,759
or whole plant cannabinoids can ethanol

1454
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,470
hold and I'm not really sure what to

1455
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,910
tell them because you know when a

1456
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,439
patient has talked to me and we're

1457
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:04,629
talking about the opposite of scaling

1458
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,730
here we're talking about a patient who's

1459
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:09,970
at home who did their summer grow and

1460
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:13,780
now they've got their you know ounce or

1461
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:16,989
whatever a flower and and and they want

1462
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:18,820
to make their tincture as potent as

1463
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:22,929
possible and so you'll you'll you'll

1464
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:24,490
take you know a half gallon of cold

1465
00:59:22,929 --> 00:59:27,190
alcohol and you're gonna pour it over

1466
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:29,469
your flowers and you're gonna you know

1467
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:32,079
you know shake that and then when you're

1468
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:33,789
done patients are like well now I want

1469
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,739
to use some more fresh flower and so

1470
00:59:33,789 --> 00:59:38,889
they they get more flesh fresh flower

1471
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:41,799
and then they pour the already extracted

1472
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:44,500
into ethanol over that and then they

1473
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,620
always ask me how many times can we do

1474
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:49,960
that at what point is the ethanol

1475
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:52,329
saturated and so I'm not even sure if

1476
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,980
I'm using the right vocabulary here but

1477
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:56,139
but I think you know where I'm going can

1478
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:59,219
you explain you explain how to think

1479
00:59:56,139 --> 01:00:02,319
about when you know that your ethanol is

1480
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:02,569
saturated and you really should not soak

1481
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,590
it

1482
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:08,570
anymore and and that product is done so

1483
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:10,660
with our code finger process where you

1484
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:14,090
can just read to still clear alcohol

1485
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:15,440
through the the material over and over

1486
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:19,850
again you can make extremely

1487
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,710
concentrated tinctures that you know

1488
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:23,750
literally what chemists call bomb out

1489
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:25,280
like it gets so saturated that it can't

1490
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,960
stay in the solution anymore and it just

1491
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,910
starts to fall to the bottom of the

1492
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,190
extractor you can or if you put in a

1493
01:00:28,909 --> 01:00:33,139
bottle you'll see that it's all bombing

1494
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:36,559
out and there's just piles of you know

1495
01:00:33,139 --> 01:00:38,779
resin or oil down on the bottom you're

1496
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,230
never gonna get that from just pouring

1497
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:44,120
cold ethanol over you know making tink

1498
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:47,210
the typical way or the common way of

1499
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:49,099
tink sharing just getting into herbal

1500
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,889
tradition as you know whatever jar of

1501
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:53,900
herb you have you pour ethanol in it

1502
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:56,809
till you know it's an inch or two above

1503
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,760
the plant material you shake it up and

1504
01:00:56,809 --> 01:01:02,259
that's supposed to be the extraction

1505
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:05,240
right there if you know let's say in

1506
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:07,010
with with cannabis you know doing that

1507
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:09,439
method you've probably got you know an

1508
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,900
eighty or ninety percent of the oil out

1509
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,929
extraction if you if you take that

1510
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:17,389
tincture and dump it over fresh material

1511
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:19,399
again your yield is gonna be a lot less

1512
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:21,710
the second time around I would think

1513
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,590
it's gonna be more you know sixty

1514
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:26,240
percent 70 percent maybe and that number

1515
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:30,289
is going to keep going down so I would

1516
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:32,689
say you know if your cannabis is very

1517
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:35,449
abundant and you don't care you could do

1518
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,860
it two or three times but you know each

1519
01:01:35,449 --> 01:01:38,569
time you do that you're gonna you're

1520
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,690
gonna pull less of the cannabinoids

1521
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:43,340
you're looking for in the terpenes from

1522
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,019
that next batch and the batch after that

1523
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:47,390
it's gonna keep dropping ten or twenty

1524
01:01:45,019 --> 01:01:49,730
percent I would think so in a perfect

1525
01:01:47,389 --> 01:01:51,019
world you'd love it you know this person

1526
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:54,679
that we're talking about would want a

1527
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:57,670
would want a solution where either they

1528
01:01:54,679 --> 01:02:00,349
do one wash and then they you know

1529
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:02,180
distill off the alcohol and then they do

1530
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:04,219
another wash and then they so that

1531
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:07,639
essentially you're doing one to one for

1532
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:11,389
your for your maximum yield or if

1533
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:13,579
somebody is doing it more at scale your

1534
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:15,339
cold fingers actually doing that whole

1535
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:18,349
thing for you in a closed-loop

1536
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:21,019
yeah it is I still think for people that

1537
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:23,509
want really strong tinctures that the

1538
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:27,440
cold fingers the best method and I know

1539
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:28,820
people who have businesses that just do

1540
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,230
that you know it's it's not a real

1541
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,359
commonplace thing especially here in

1542
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:34,159
Washington and they don't allow

1543
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:37,159
alcohol-based tincture so there there's

1544
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:39,108
no business but I I mean I just know

1545
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:42,049
people who you know they might be gray

1546
01:02:39,108 --> 01:02:44,809
market you might say but they're using

1547
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:47,690
cold fingers to extract cannabis and

1548
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:50,449
then they they do a carbon filtration

1549
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:52,700
drop the wax out and then just sell the

1550
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:54,589
product like that and it's it's a very

1551
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:56,239
nice product because if you do it right

1552
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:59,030
you know you haven't if you're not

1553
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,858
readest ihling at all back out and you

1554
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:03,140
let the cold finger cool down before you

1555
01:03:00,858 --> 01:03:06,259
open it up after an extraction your

1556
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:08,210
terpene profile is completely intact so

1557
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:11,630
you're getting a full spectrum whole

1558
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:13,490
plant extract and what the you know the

1559
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:15,440
real tincture heads have noticed is that

1560
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:17,929
different strains have a particular

1561
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,550
taste but that's dependent on getting

1562
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:23,509
all the wax in the chlorophyll aisle and

1563
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:25,310
then that brings out the bouquet and you

1564
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:26,750
know people that are really into it you

1565
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:28,519
know they can they can smell a tincture

1566
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,719
and have a good idea which strain that

1567
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:33,650
is mm-hmm

1568
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:38,059
so so this show is very much whole

1569
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:40,220
plant-based and and so we we hold up

1570
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:42,469
ethanol as essentially being the gold

1571
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:44,299
standard for cannabis medicine right for

1572
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:46,579
for rec you know there's a lot of other

1573
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,500
things that people may prefer but but

1574
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:51,710
for for a patient that we want to get

1575
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:54,769
them the widest range of cannabinoids

1576
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:56,420
with the widest spectrum of terpenes you

1577
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:59,630
know ethanol seems to be the way to go

1578
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:02,119
that said I'm curious to know from your

1579
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:04,130
experience what are we still losing from

1580
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:05,780
the plant when we do an ethanol

1581
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:08,420
extraction I'm sure that there's

1582
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:11,840
something that we're losing that we may

1583
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:14,000
want what what might not make it through

1584
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:16,910
the ethanol extraction process that's

1585
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,980
valuable to us to patients so the

1586
01:04:16,909 --> 01:04:21,079
monoterpenes are going to evaporate off

1587
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:25,760
very easily so when you when you

1588
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:28,190
redistill or or flash off the ethanol

1589
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,028
from a hash oil extraction you're going

1590
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:30,979
to lose those mono

1591
01:04:29,028 --> 01:04:33,650
terpenes which are pretty important to

1592
01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:35,088
that you know entourage effect so the

1593
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:38,150
method I was talking about earlier we

1594
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:39,679
you do the coldfinger extraction let the

1595
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:41,659
unit cool down so there's not going to

1596
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:44,838
be a bunch of vapor coming off when you

1597
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:48,199
open it up and then pour that off carbon

1598
01:04:44,838 --> 01:04:51,768
filter it and drop the wax out the

1599
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:54,019
terpene profile will be intact but if

1600
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:55,399
you're if you're distilling off the

1601
01:04:54,018 --> 01:04:57,048
ethanol you're gonna you know you'll

1602
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:01,189
probably still have some sesqui terpenes

1603
01:04:57,048 --> 01:05:02,659
but you're going to lose monoterpenes so

1604
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:04,158
just you know if you don't mind me

1605
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:08,179
making a little pitch for our products

1606
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:10,249
our modern-day commercial extractor

1607
01:05:08,179 --> 01:05:12,229
distillers that we do for cold ethanol

1608
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:15,288
and all kinds of other things they can

1609
01:05:12,228 --> 01:05:17,658
be configured to do steam distilling so

1610
01:05:15,289 --> 01:05:19,459
you could steam distill your cannabis

1611
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:22,849
first get your essential oils or

1612
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:25,668
monoterpenes then you know spin the

1613
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:27,349
water out with a centrifuge and put it

1614
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:30,139
back in there and ethanol extract it

1615
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:32,479
then refine out the chlorophyll and the

1616
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:34,578
wax and add those terpenes back to it

1617
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:37,068
and and you've got a very you know full

1618
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:40,189
spectrum extract that has only the

1619
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:44,650
things you want in it right on so I've

1620
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:47,199
got a question about treat treating the

1621
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:49,429
ethanol hash oil after the extraction

1622
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:52,429
some people will say that ethanol

1623
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:54,709
extraction can provide everything that

1624
01:05:52,429 --> 01:05:57,619
the the modern cannabis market is

1625
01:05:54,708 --> 01:06:02,389
looking for from the from the eh-oh -

1626
01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:03,919
dabs - viscous liquid for pens and and I

1627
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:05,838
you know I'm not a professional

1628
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:08,778
extractor so I don't know what after

1629
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,849
extraction processes would need to be

1630
01:06:08,778 --> 01:06:14,358
done to do that but it seems that that

1631
01:06:10,849 --> 01:06:16,519
might be a little overstated what are

1632
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:18,978
your thoughts it can f'n all do it all

1633
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:22,518
or do we really need the the whole range

1634
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:24,498
of of c8 a co2 and BHO for these

1635
01:06:22,518 --> 01:06:27,188
different products that that people are

1636
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:30,048
enjoying in the modern cannabis market

1637
01:06:27,188 --> 01:06:32,389
generally speaking you know because the

1638
01:06:30,048 --> 01:06:35,088
main market now is vape pens and I

1639
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:37,578
really think the best vape pens are

1640
01:06:35,088 --> 01:06:39,409
where you you know run a co2 unit and it

1641
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:42,140
takes you know some talent to do that to

1642
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:42,650
do make good co2 oil takes you know

1643
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:44,420
Talent

1644
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:47,240
artistic ability there's a lot of cruddy

1645
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:49,460
co2 oil out there but if you if you do

1646
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:51,739
the terpene pole which is you know they

1647
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:54,889
jump out really early and you make that

1648
01:06:51,739 --> 01:06:56,449
Terp sauce and then put set that aside

1649
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:58,879
you know drain it out or squirt it out

1650
01:06:56,449 --> 01:07:01,399
and then finish the extraction and

1651
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,829
refine you know all the cannabinoids

1652
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,470
down and add that early turk pullback

1653
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:09,650
yeah that's that's the best way to make

1654
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:14,389
a tasty full spectrum you know vape pen

1655
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:16,430
product most of the the only good the

1656
01:07:14,389 --> 01:07:21,349
only good vape pen products that I've

1657
01:07:16,429 --> 01:07:23,719
had they were ethanol is where they they

1658
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:25,849
short path the ethanol extract and get

1659
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:29,509
it to like pure cannabinoids and then

1660
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:31,400
you know they had the terpenes at added

1661
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:34,670
back in whether they steam distilled it

1662
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:37,070
or they bought terpenes from you know

1663
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:39,289
Bennett true terpenes or something like

1664
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:42,320
that but you know that's the only time

1665
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:44,719
I've seen a good ethanol vape pen as you

1666
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:47,420
know it distilled you know clear that's

1667
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,730
like 95% cannabinoids with terpenes

1668
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:52,159
added back in I mean most of the bait

1669
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:55,369
pens I've seen that we're kind of less

1670
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:59,210
refined ethanol extracts we're pretty

1671
01:07:55,369 --> 01:08:03,230
nasty tasting and then I've seen really

1672
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:05,990
good ethanol shatter which is you know

1673
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:08,570
basically you have to be able to see the

1674
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:11,299
ethanol coming through the product and

1675
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:13,070
and and when you see when it starts to

1676
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,380
change color and get darker you pull

1677
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:17,840
that away you only you know you want to

1678
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:20,359
get the very first you know kind of like

1679
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:22,730
the first press of olive oil you know is

1680
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:25,309
the the best oil the virgin oil and kind

1681
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:27,649
of like the Terp sauce with co2 but you

1682
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:29,360
know with cold ethanol you needed to see

1683
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:31,009
it passing through and what color it is

1684
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,349
and you know while it's still a bright

1685
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:35,449
pretty golden that's the stuff that can

1686
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:37,760
be turned into shatter and it'll have a

1687
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:39,439
real nice taste to it it's interesting

1688
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,880
that you mentioned olive oil because

1689
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:45,109
when you when you were talking earlier

1690
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:49,850
about how using co2 extraction for the

1691
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:52,279
vape pen market to do it properly it

1692
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:54,740
takes more than just an understanding of

1693
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:55,729
how the co2 extractor work it actually

1694
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:58,699
takes

1695
01:08:55,729 --> 01:09:01,939
a death of knowledge and artistry and

1696
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:05,840
who came to mind was our mutual friend

1697
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:08,509
Jeff Church presently over at at puffin

1698
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:11,659
farms and and he that you know they pay

1699
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:14,720
they push this term EVF Oh extra virgin

1700
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:17,090
flower oil yeah and and you know the

1701
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,860
product that they make is is top of the

1702
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:21,409
market right it doesn't taste like these

1703
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:21,920
you know like these you know hot dog

1704
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:24,050
water

1705
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,880
you know soupy pens of distillate and

1706
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:28,220
stuff it's got a it's got a depth of

1707
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,739
flavor that you don't get anywhere just

1708
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:32,329
like when you see you know any kind of

1709
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:34,429
artisan put out a product and you're

1710
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:36,289
like you're like damn this is this is

1711
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:38,600
very much better than all the other

1712
01:09:36,289 --> 01:09:42,069
stuff I've ever had I think that idea of

1713
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:44,840
a of a first pressing of an olive oil

1714
01:09:42,069 --> 01:09:48,889
versus you know a an extra version

1715
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:51,020
cannabis oil is is apt yeah so yeah

1716
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:53,600
props to Jeff and Sam back in the day

1717
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:56,570
for they were the first people to figure

1718
01:09:53,600 --> 01:10:00,650
out - how do how to get a pure turf or

1719
01:09:56,569 --> 01:10:03,829
yeah pure terpene run with co2 and one

1720
01:10:00,649 --> 01:10:05,449
of the earliest dirt festivals you know

1721
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:09,470
Jeff entered that product and it was a

1722
01:10:05,449 --> 01:10:11,149
pure terpene co2 and there were people

1723
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:12,710
that wanted to disqualify him because

1724
01:10:11,149 --> 01:10:16,219
they said it can't be done that you're

1725
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:18,230
you're lying you did something and we

1726
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,380
pushed really hard and got that turned

1727
01:10:18,229 --> 01:10:22,759
around and they got the award and and

1728
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:25,250
yeah they were the first to do it or the

1729
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,409
first I'm aware of they were able to do

1730
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:29,239
it and you know now it's I wouldn't call

1731
01:10:27,409 --> 01:10:32,149
it common now but there's certainly a

1732
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:34,130
lot more people doing that but yeah Jeff

1733
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:36,379
and Sam to my knowledge were the first

1734
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:38,180
to figure it out I remember I remember

1735
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:40,670
that year of the Terp Esteva land and

1736
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,740
and and all the kind of drama around it

1737
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:45,140
on awards day and Jeff's poor broken

1738
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:46,729
heart right cuz like yeah you know Jeff

1739
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,170
worked his ass off to develop this

1740
01:10:46,729 --> 01:10:50,119
technique and for them to say that

1741
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:52,760
you're disqualified because what you did

1742
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:55,640
isn't possible that's pretty that's

1743
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:58,130
pretty groundbreaking yeah and from our

1744
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,869
point of view in the very early co2 days

1745
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:02,090
you know there were always those who

1746
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:04,159
wanted to knock co2 especially you know

1747
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:06,980
the BHO that you know it's kind of a

1748
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:08,789
competition there and people would say I

1749
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:12,149
co2 sucks it doesn't get

1750
01:11:08,789 --> 01:11:15,210
terpenes and then five or six years

1751
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:21,659
later the insult is co2 is only Goods

1752
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:25,199
returned yeah it's so so yeah clearly

1753
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:26,670
co2 and the extractor people you know

1754
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,380
the extraction artists if you will

1755
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:30,600
themselves they've evolved a lot too

1756
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,190
right yeah sure yeah yeah in there in

1757
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,460
the early days you guys had to do a lot

1758
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:38,399
of training of extraction teams just so

1759
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:40,079
that they could use your proper your you

1760
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:41,609
know extraction machines properly so

1761
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,579
they didn't give you guys a bad name

1762
01:11:41,609 --> 01:11:46,829
because of the machine but nowadays that

1763
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:50,699
you know that insight is a lot more

1764
01:11:46,829 --> 01:11:53,819
available so in that same idea as you

1765
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:55,979
know the the evolution of it so so you

1766
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:58,799
know each big evolution and technology

1767
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:01,889
opens up new markets and creates new

1768
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,619
products what do you see as a coming

1769
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:06,840
evolution in extraction tech that will

1770
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:08,069
create new market opportunities and you

1771
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,720
don't it doesn't have to be ethanol

1772
01:12:08,069 --> 01:12:12,119
either I mean you're eating labs

1773
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:15,420
produces an entire range of extraction

1774
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:18,539
equipment from co2 to BHO to ethanol so

1775
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:21,390
you know as the R&amp;D guy they're trying

1776
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:24,180
to push the envelope what do you see in

1777
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:26,250
coming down the pipe that that might

1778
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:31,590
open up new doors and the industry for

1779
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:36,720
new products so we actually figured this

1780
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:38,340
out quite a few years ago but you know

1781
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,619
for various reasons we didn't we didn't

1782
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:45,529
push it too much at the time but we're

1783
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:49,369
going to start promoting the concept of

1784
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:52,739
adding a small amount of propane to co2

1785
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:57,210
because it's it's kind of well what was

1786
01:12:52,739 --> 01:13:00,329
explained to me the guys who do the

1787
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:03,569
large-scale short pathing mostly right

1788
01:13:00,329 --> 01:13:06,119
now they're using ethanol extracts and

1789
01:13:03,569 --> 01:13:07,469
you know the ethanol advantage to the

1790
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:09,779
ethanol is you can just do such

1791
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:13,199
large-scale you know quickly and

1792
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:15,840
affordably but a lot of the the refiners

1793
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:18,599
you know they they don't like the

1794
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,400
ethanol because there's so many they

1795
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,179
have to do many passes and there's

1796
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,519
there's always problem

1797
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:27,310
with different kinds of particulate that

1798
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,840
are in there and ethanol that you know

1799
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:31,719
they might have to do one or two passes

1800
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,760
just to get residual ethanol out and so

1801
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:35,948
what I'm told I'm not a short path guy

1802
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:39,520
myself but I certainly have good friends

1803
01:13:35,948 --> 01:13:41,619
that are and they like they like

1804
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,719
hydrocarbon extracts and they like co2

1805
01:13:41,619 --> 01:13:47,289
extracts as far as what they like to

1806
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:50,800
refine with but you know the co2 they

1807
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:54,010
believe is too slow of a process and the

1808
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:56,140
hydrocarbon has you know the

1809
01:13:54,010 --> 01:14:01,539
flammability risks and the liability

1810
01:13:56,140 --> 01:14:04,329
risks and the regulatory risks so we

1811
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:10,569
know that we can add a small amount of

1812
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:14,079
propane to co2 and it will in in in the

1813
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:17,198
extraction will be as fast as with just

1814
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:19,269
pure hydrocarbon but it won't be

1815
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:21,789
flammable there's not enough propane and

1816
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:23,170
because the co2 represses that and you

1817
01:14:21,789 --> 01:14:26,920
know even if the system would delete

1818
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:29,920
badly both gases stay mixed and settle

1819
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,810
on the floor and we know for a fact that

1820
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,539
you know with that can we can do this in

1821
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:37,000
a way that it's not flammable and it's

1822
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:42,219
it extracts us very very quickly and

1823
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,689
efficiently and it's it's been requested

1824
01:14:42,219 --> 01:14:45,939
that you know we start pushing this and

1825
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:49,359
bring this to market so it's it's the

1826
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:51,158
next thing we're gonna push and I

1827
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,259
already know that you know there's other

1828
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:54,789
they're starting to be a buzz out there

1829
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:59,530
you know we've got a couple competitors

1830
01:14:54,789 --> 01:15:01,179
that are also pushing that and you know

1831
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:04,960
we know John McKay is mentioned it a few

1832
01:15:01,179 --> 01:15:08,469
times in public so we we don't know for

1833
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:10,840
sure because you know these trends you

1834
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:13,420
know take a momentum of their own but it

1835
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,949
makes sense that this could become you

1836
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:17,710
know a new method especially for people

1837
01:15:14,948 --> 01:15:19,029
who want to do refining right on well

1838
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:20,739
thank you for sharing that you know it's

1839
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:23,079
interesting I bet you that the idea of

1840
01:15:20,738 --> 01:15:25,119
mixing propane with co2 just kind of

1841
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:27,250
blew a bunch of minds people like no way

1842
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:29,079
I need to know more about that

1843
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:31,689
and that's what keeps this exciting

1844
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:33,189
right is that yeah is that you know the

1845
01:15:31,689 --> 01:15:36,729
people who are really into it who have

1846
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:39,699
got a blend of engineering science and

1847
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:42,609
you know passionate vision they

1848
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:43,779
continually push this and and that's why

1849
01:15:42,609 --> 01:15:47,529
we find all these great new

1850
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:49,239
technological solutions and with that so

1851
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:50,729
thank you for spending some time with us

1852

fritz you know I know that you're not

1853
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:57,039
usually the guy who's out talking it's

1854
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:58,840
usually AC Braddock from from from Eaton

1855
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:00,729
labs but the fact that you were willing

1856
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,590
to you know come out of your your your

1857
