1
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:08,009
hey there Shango and IM down at Indo

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:10,289
Expo in Portland today and I got here a

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,199
day early to hang out with my friend

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,638
here Ben Cassaday from true terpenes

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:17,519
true terpenes has have been one of the

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,660
original sponsors of shaping fire you've

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,759
been hearing their commercials on the

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,230
show for a long time and so Ben and I

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,100
got together today for lunch and we were

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,960
talking and he's telling me about these

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,240
new certifications that true terpenes

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,609
has gotten as a company and they're the

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,039
first folks in terpenes and cannabis

14
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,359
maybe at all to get these and they were

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,859
so interesting and really hold on hold

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,929
on Ben we got it we got to do this and

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,429
record it because this is something that

18
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,010
nobody else is talking about and I think

19
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:47,190
we should as the industry as a whole is

20
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,689
trying to increase quality so Ben nice

21
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,358
nice to see you and thanks for buying

22
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:54,478
lunch I always have to be so my question

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,088
for you is is why are these new 3

24
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:59,100
certifications that you guys are in the

25
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,319
process of and this first one this this

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,879
good manufacturing practices which

27
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:05,189
sounds like it's kind of key to the

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,200
triangle like teach us about that tell

29
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,938
us why that's important you know GMP

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,340
good manufacturing practices really is

31
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,129
just a set of principles that are

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,829
followed across Enterprise industries

33
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:19,259
everywhere from you know ironworking to

34
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:21,599
medical device manufacturing to food and

35
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,590
it basically means that you

36
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,689
have put thoughtful practices into place

37
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,510
for manufacturing starting from the time

38
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,149
when you design your facility all the

39
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,219
way up to the next step of the along the

40
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,950
way of sourcing your raw materials and

41
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,569
then how you combine those raw materials

42
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,759
into your final product and then deliver

43
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,889
that product so it's really its its

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,859
oversight its quality control and its

45
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,939
quality assurance through the entire

46
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:49,200
entirety of creating a product and

47
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,149
delivering it to your consumers and then

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,890
even past that it's the way that you

49
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,910
collect the feedback from your consumers

50
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,129
it's the way that you handle your

51
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,200
complaints it's the way that you educate

52
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,539
and train your employees so what it

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,549
really gives us is a greater level of

54
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:04,618
control over the entire process and a

55
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,569
greater level of understanding as far as

56
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,920
what are we purchasing and from who you

57
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,629
know part of that process is not just

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,860
purchasing things off of the internet

59
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,239
and taking the word of the supplier

60
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,680
that's selling it to you but actually

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,019
sending a representative from your

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,540
company to the supplier to audit their

63
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,810
facility based upon a set of criteria

64
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,159
that's been established and approved

65
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,500
when you when you received your

66
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,229
certification so for us last week we

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,370
actually received our final hard copy of

68
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:33,959
our certification for a GMP

69
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,250
2019 we were really happy with that we

70
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,939
actually almost immediately afterwards

71
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,579
had a surprise audit got a 96.5% nice as

72
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,109
far as the grading scale goes so you

73
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,099
know really happy with that one and and

74
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,670
what it really comes down to the

75
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,319
importance of GMP is you know for these

76
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,879
multi-state operators people that are

77
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,310
that are working at a really large scale

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,959
or business operators that are coming in

79
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,909
from other industries that are kind of

80
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,009
used to following these parameters it's

81
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,719
always a surprise to them that they

82
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:02,719
can't purchase things in the cannabis

83
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,129
world that come from GMP certified

84
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,799
manufacturers so for us meaning that

85
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,019
people are not GM certified GMP

86
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,790
certified in cannabis so so these larger

87
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,189
companies are coming with the hopes of

88
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,090
making gargantuan purchases and they're

89
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:17,280
like there's nobody we can do business

90
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,500
with exactly exactly so for us you know

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,239
the the real focus and the pressure came

92
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,139
from getting ready to do business with

93
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,459
Canada specifically because of the

94
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,079
you know the legal market that's been

95
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,780
established in Canada and the

96
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,150
relationship that all of these that all

97
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,870
these LPS have with European

98
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,909
counterparts

99
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,469
you know Canada isn't just an

100
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:39,849
opportunity to sell the 35 million

101
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,590
people it's an opportunity to sell the

102
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:44,680
400 million people because Canada will

103
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:47,469
be exporting to Europe potentially to

104
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,560
Israel potentially to Australia and all

105
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:52,180
in in order for a product to be

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,739
manufactured in Canada and for it to be

107
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,780
then sent to one of these other markets

108
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,670
it's going to have to be manufactured

109
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,530
under GMP practices and for something to

110
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:02,199
be manufactured under GMP practices in

111
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,729
most cases all of the raw materials that

112
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,738
go into that product must come from a

113
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,209
GMP facility as well right when you

114
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,519
first started describing it you said

115
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,500
that you know it's it's a it's kind of

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,230
like guidance for very thoughtful

117
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,459
manufacturing right and you know you

118
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:18,159
know most of the more professional

119
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,978
responsible companies in cannabis would

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,040
probably self describe their processes

121
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:25,870
is thoughtful right and you gave us a

122
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,910
really nice kind of like actually pretty

123
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,250
exhaustive list of all the things that

124
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,320
you have to do the different categories

125
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,870
that have to be dialed in can you give

126
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,978
me two examples in any two categories of

127
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,530
you know what kind of the default

128
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,149
setting was and and how you had to drill

129
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,399
that down to meet these requirements

130
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,409
well I think you know the the one that

131
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:50,889
stood out to me the most is surprising

132
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,840
was the the complaints and positive

133
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:55,569
feedback for the customer service cycle

134
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,239
so traditionally you know we did a

135
00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:01,269
pretty good job of rectifying complaints

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,680
and thanking people for their positive

137
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:04,870
feedback but we didn't actually have a

138
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,788
methodical way of logging that and then

139
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,500
addressing it like somebody might call

140
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:11,288
and say hey my bottle leaked in transit

141
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,728
and historically we would have said you

142
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:14,079
know we're very sorry to hear about that

143
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:16,089
you know let us overnight you a

144
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,800
replacement and does that make you happy

145
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,810
great case closed

146
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,879
at this point which sounds like fully

147
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,490
reasonable customer spaceman yeah handle

148
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,019
the customers happy etc but now we have

149
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,050
this error complaint log the air

150
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:31,418
complaint log is is spoken about a

151
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,020
specific quality control meeting once a

152
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:34,639
week and then addressed again

153
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,098
FLE as kind of like a consolidated

154
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,960
report and there's thresholds and I

155
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:41,029
don't know all of them off the top of my

156
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,609
head right now but basically let's say

157
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:45,978
that we had a thousand packages shipped

158
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,759
in a month and 50 of them came back with

159
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:51,709
leap complaints that would trigger a

160
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,348
quality chain a change management

161
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:56,388
process to where we have to look into is

162
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:58,310
it the cap is it the lining of the cap

163
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,288
is it that what could have went wrong is

164
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,180
it is it the physical labor that's

165
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:03,949
putting the cap on is it the shrink band

166
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,990
like we look at all of the different

167
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,579
principles that go into allowing that to

168
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,470
happen and we have to make an action

169
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:11,000
plan and then we have to follow up on

170
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,729
that action plan in the following months

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,250
meeting and compare did the plan work is

172
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:17,779
there less and so it forces through

173
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,819
there to be continual improvement so I'd

174
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,049
say that's the first one just because

175
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,610
you know you feel like you're doing a

176
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,408
great job in Quality Assurance but then

177
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,788
you're sorry and not in handling

178
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:27,408
customer complaints and positive

179
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:28,939
feedback but then you find out that

180
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:30,889
there's actually maybe an iterative

181
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:33,050
process that you can go through to make

182
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,780
it even better and so that's been very

183
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,418
positive for us and then I think

184
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:41,000
probably you know one of the other ones

185
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:43,279
that wasn't as surprising but was a very

186
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,228
major change and I think one of the true

187
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:49,698
advantages now of doing business with it

188
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:51,709
with us is when we first started going

189
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,389
down this road no longer taking the word

190
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:55,098
of suppliers that we were buying things

191
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,408
from and going into the facilities and

192
00:06:55,098 --> 00:07:00,620
actually doing audits and sending our

193
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:01,968
quality director in to make sure that

194
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,500
they were actually upholding and doing

195
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:05,360
the things that they were making claims

196
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,990
on when they were selling us their

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,098
products and that's things like you know

198
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,990
claiming that something was stored in

199
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:13,959
cold storage but it's actually just at

200
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,689
room temperature or

201
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,879
you know and a big one is you know a lot

202
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,379
of people will you know and when we

203
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,360
started off we were doing this as well

204
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,750
they'll take the certificate of analysis

205
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,449
from the supplier as gospel and never do

206
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,579
any additional internal testing or

207
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,990
third-party testing to to verify that

208
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:33,668
and so that's one of the first things we

209
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,740
changed early on about two years ago

210
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:37,149
well we started going down this process

211
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,009
but I think it's just one of the most

212
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:41,379
dramatic things if you're buying from a

213
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,539
company and relying on all of their

214
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,219
intelligence to make your decisions that

215
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,540
you know people were all human people

216
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,960
make mistakes and if you're not

217
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,330
verifying a lot along the line it's as

218
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,879
simple as receiving a you know ordering

219
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:57,939
two shipments from a supplier in

220
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,439
sequence and maybe them receiving one of

221
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:00,790
them out of order and then tagging

222
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,110
something wrong thinking that it's a

223
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,910
different lot of product and then

224
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,009
attributing the paperwork to that lot

225
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,360
and then down the down the line all

226
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,978
sorts of different changes can cascade

227
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,780
because you think you have one product

228
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:12,879
but you actually have another so it's

229
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:15,279
just uh you know it's it's it's like I

230
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,228
said the words get used a lot but its

231
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,879
quality control its controlling the

232
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:20,529
situation and then it's double checking

233
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,389
that and assuring it with the quality

234
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,069
assurance so I think I think those two

235
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,478
are probably the - two of the biggest

236
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:26,769
that we've that we've dealt with and

237
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:30,209
learned from right those good examples

238
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:32,769
um a couple thoughts come to mind one is

239
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:35,769
you know all of these additional trips

240
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:38,110
to your suppliers and hotel rooms and

241
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:40,750
and all that additional employees that

242
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:44,709
you've got a hire to do this clearly

243
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:47,320
these costs are rising and and if you

244
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:49,088
didn't grow as a company it would really

245
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,490
probably eat into your margins but as a

246
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,110
business person it's an interesting

247
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,879
hustle to consider that okay we're gonna

248
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,709
we're gonna hire these new people and

249
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,789
we're to spend all these new money Nutan

250
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:01,269
we're gonna spend all this money on

251
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:03,519
qualifications but what it does is open

252
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:05,829
up you know Canada and international

253
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,809
trade and being able to do business with

254
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,930
companies like coca-cola right we're who

255
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:12,369
demand GMP certification exactly so you

256
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:14,120
know it's interesting as terpenes

257
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,179
develop into more than

258
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,009
just being used specifically in cannabis

259
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:20,509
products you know kind of like adding it

260
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:22,338
to a tincture or adding it to a topical

261
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,659
or combining with a bait pen you know

262
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,520
we're starting to get these functional

263
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:28,250
products or that people are developing

264
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,889
we're getting five-hour energy type

265
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,830
shots that are meant to manipulate and

266
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:35,330
modify your your cannabis experience and

267
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,150
so we're having a lot of companies come

268
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:42,770
into the space like the coca-cola or Big

269
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:43,939
Five beverage Brewers and they want you

270
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,460
know they want to work with us as well

271
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,529
but then immediately almost almost as

272
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,910
soon as the samples arrived they they

273
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:50,899
get them they like them they talk okay

274
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,100
now we're gonna move you over to

275
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,079
purchasing and we're start talking about

276
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,610
papering this up immediately that's the

277
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
first thing is where the certifications

278
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,879
we need to know what we're working with

279
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,759
and so yeah I mean you you hit the nail

280
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,019
on the head it's what its it is and it

281
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,088
continues to be a pretty large

282
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:08,809
investment of resources to be able to do

283
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:10,490
this but it allows us to give greater

284
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,899
quality assurance to the people that

285
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,250
have done business with us from the

286
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:16,459
start and it allows us to bring in new

287
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,830
contracts and new clients from from

288
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,600
other worlds where where regulation

289
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,278
matters a little bit more but I will say

290
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,170
it's not it didn't come to us as a

291
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,059
surprise like we didn't one day go oh

292
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:27,588
you know we should go quality like from

293
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,689
the very beginning we intended to build

294
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,220
the terpene company that would that

295
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,770
would survive and would be able to do

296
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,410
business with regulated cannabis markets

297
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:38,389
we we didn't chase after fast money in

298
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:40,879
the beginning we've basically been

299
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:44,389
reinvesting towards this since early

300
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,700
since late 2016 so it's just its final

301
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:48,980
you know that's the other thing too is

302
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,060
if you if your company started within

303
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,519
the last year

304
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:53,778
you're not gmpd like you and that's

305
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,028
that's one of the things that you need

306
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,110
to really watch out for I think you have

307
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:59,330
a lot of people saying that they're

308
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,440
operating under GM tipi standards but

309
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,000
that doesn't mean that they've actually

310
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,800
had a third party audit and that they

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,570
actually are doing it it just means that

312
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,979
they it's kind of aspirational yeah

313
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,250
really it's called being in the spirit

314
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,550
of is the technical term

315
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:16,720
and you know I know growers who are in

316
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:18,490
the spirit over organic that's one of

317
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,899
the main things in that we're hoping you

318
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,049
know and I love the opportunity to talk

319
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:24,190
about this because you know the question

320
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,539
to ask if somebody tells you that

321
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,199
they're certified is can I see your

322
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,879
certificate

323
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:30,338
can I see who's who's the third party

324
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,319
that audits you and then you know if

325
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,699
you're concerned you know there's also

326
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:34,958
within the cannabis world I hate to have

327
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:36,849
to say it but there's there's a lot of

328
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,919
counterfeit going on you know call the

329
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,129
third party if you're if you're not 100%

330
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,750
satisfied or convinced of its

331
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:45,129
authenticity because it's that's their

332
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,139
job the third part third party's gonna

333
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,339
ask you for the the certificate number

334
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,959
or the name of the business they'll look

335
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:52,990
you up and they'll tell you exactly what

336
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:55,750
happened in the last audit and they just

337
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,579
make it really easy so so um you're also

338
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:01,559
mentioning that that now that you are

339
00:11:57,578 --> 00:12:05,198
GMP certified this sets you up for

340
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,549
additional certifications that that just

341
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:08,559
get heavier and heavier what are those

342
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:11,649
yeah so the one that follows right after

343
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:14,739
GMP is is FSP which is just food safety

344
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:17,429
plan basically is very very similar to

345
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:21,490
to having like a

346
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:23,019
GMP operations procedure for basically

347
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,700
everything but it pertains to the fact

348
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:26,559
that our products are meant for human

349
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,810
consumption and so it goes above and

350
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,549
beyond what you might need for like

351
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:32,199
medical device manufacturing or

352
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,179
something like that it's just ensuring

353
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,649
proper storage of raw materials that are

354
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,000
going to be consumed making sure that

355
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,750
you keep a shelf life on everything

356
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,458
making sure that you're keeping

357
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,980
basically every single lot that we send

358
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:46,899
out into the world has to then have a

359
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,370
sample retained so that if somebody

360
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,559
calls and says you know we got this

361
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,899
tested and it was full of heavy metals

362
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,549
and pesticides we can pull that lot out

363
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,049
of the refrigerator send it off for

364
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,909
testing and confirm that in fact it

365
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,319
wasn't our product right so it goes

366
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:00,490
above and beyond to ensure that and a

367
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,320
lot of that stuff I mean I've toured

368
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,789
your your manufacturing facility already

369
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,100
did a lot of that stuff but I get that

370
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:08,829
this is this is making sure that you've

371
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,800
got numbered and certified paperwork

372
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,980
yeah behind your practices exactly it's

373
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,629
just so it stands up in court that's a

374
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,920
big part of it and then you know the

375
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,110
last certification the one that we're

376
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:26,169
actually probably most excited about and

377
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:28,180
two is is the iso 9001 2015 which to get

378
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:30,069
to you basically do all of the

379
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:33,789
requirements of GMP anyway so most

380
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:36,129
people will go GMP and then go ISO and

381
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:38,740
it's just based it's the international

382
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,750
standards whereas GMP as we're

383
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,639
practicing it for my understanding is

384
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,789
just like United States based and

385
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,559
focused primarily however like I had

386
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:51,509
mentioned I know that several European

387
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:54,719
nations major ones like Germany and

388
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:57,509
operate off of those same standards ISO

389
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,610
is the international standards and so

390
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:02,639
what that basically it goes above and

391
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:06,089
beyond for for documentation and vetting

392
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,740
of the suppliers and you know I'd have

393
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:09,089
to I have to really default to our

394
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,709
quality director to point out all the

395
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,690
exact specifics that make it different

396
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,768
but it's it's above and beyond it's a

397
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,660
little bit more rigorous and it's

398
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,190
internationally recognized which really

399
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,169
will just give us again that foothold to

400
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,730
be able to go and work with multi-state

401
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:21,929
and multi country operators within

402
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,889
cannabis and and then other

403
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:27,929
organizations from a traditional world

404
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:29,370
you know kind of to wrap up I know that

405
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,250
you know you go back way back into the

406
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,528
medical days like I do right and and you

407
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,950
know it's kind of funny because like no

408
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:40,799
I I still yearn for the medical days and

409
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,589
the freedoms that we had and and the

410
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,019
quality of products that we had and yet

411
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,910
you know when when when regulatory

412
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,220
structures started to come out I was a

413
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:51,539
fan of everybody having to get product

414
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,278
testing right because a lot of stuff

415
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:54,899
went through medical without proper

416
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,879
numbers without it going to a lab or

417
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,940
anything so you know there even though I

418
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:03,419
even though I miss medical you know the

419
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,029
increased of quality so that patients

420
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:08,729
can get what they're expecting to get

421
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:10,799
right this is like all the way at the

422
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,170
other end of that right yeah this is

423
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,299
this is this is not people prepping

424
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:17,939
products and kitchens or you know this

425
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:20,519
is this is regulatory kind of enough's

426
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,680
they had a steroid level and I guess

427
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,490
that's what's necessary to for you to

428
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,620
make a jump as a company from you know

429
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,889
us you know having started small

430
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,839
becoming national pretty quick but then

431
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,000
you know the whole world market is there

432
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,649
and and everybody's gonna have to start

433
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,169
stepping up because you know we talk a

434
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:42,389
lot on the show about how you know some

435
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:44,969
folks are gonna stay local yep and then

436
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:46,889
when inner state transport becomes

437
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,620
allowed a lot of those local companies

438
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,929
if they have not developed specialty

439
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,820
products and strains and got their

440
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:55,489
margins where they need them to be

441
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,129
they're all just gonna disappear every

442
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,379
pop-up and and then yeah nationwide so

443
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:03,230
if you are a product manufacturer and

444
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:05,299
this these these these ideas of GMP and

445
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,350
ISO are new to you

446
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,909
you might want to look into it

447
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,860
especially if you're looking to expand

448
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:12,439
quickly because it takes a while to do

449
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,169
this stuff and to develop the procedures

450
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,240
and work with them so that as the market

451
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:20,479
expands you can be there and ready to go

452
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,889
you know and I think depending on it

453
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,180
doesn't really matter which direction

454
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,250
you plan on going if you plan on

455
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:26,899
operating your organization for the next

456
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:31,100
thirty years and you have no plan of

457
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,750
parting from it following the path of

458
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,450
getting these certifications is only

459
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,700
going to help you stay compliant with

460
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,350
regulations as they as they develop

461
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,970
whether that means you know you're in

462
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,830
Canada and they're reducing regulation

463
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,120
or you're in the United States and

464
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,500
they're trying to you know put the

465
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,639
toothpaste back into the tube with us

466
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,409
and then the other end of the spectrum

467
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,080
if you're trying to sell your company or

468
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:56,509
if you're trying to you know whatever

469
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,670
flavor of that having these

470
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:01,159
certifications makes it it's very

471
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:03,639
enticing to investors or to new business

472
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:07,789
partners or whoever to see that you have

473
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,289
written SOPs and methods for everything

474
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:11,359
across your business and again it's that

475
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,389
thoughtfulness it's that you you took a

476
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,879
view from 30,000 feet down and looked at

477
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,130
how should the business run and then you

478
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,720
planned it that way and executed that

479
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,309
way and I think that that's really you

480
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,279
know the audit that that's really the

481
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:27,619
main difference is you buy ourselves you

482
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,690
know we were we were operating very much

483
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,459
in this way but having somebody else

484
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,320
come in from the outside and say you

485
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,299
know you say you do it this way but I'm

486
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,039
watching the way that you open the caps

487
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,210
and pour those bottles and it's not the

488
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,769
way that you had it written so let's

489
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,150
adjust that either we need to change

490
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:42,558
what's written or we need to change the

491
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:46,700
action but let's make sure that it

492
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:49,849
matches is it's for all of the things

493
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,679
that about regulatory cannabis that

494
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:53,299
