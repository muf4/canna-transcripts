00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,359
it doesn't matter who you are really

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,120
modern life is stressful and causes

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,399
various forms of anxiety in all of us

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,919
there are so many recommended actions we

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,640
can take to help reduce that stress

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,720
exercise meditation eating Whole Foods

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,320
to keep our gut biome happy and working

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,198
directly to resolve the source of stress

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,800
are all proven to work very ious

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,600
Pharmaceuticals come and go in

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,480
popularity and supposedly help but most

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,879
are either addictive or eventually

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,398
debunked as

15
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:42,159
ineffective and then there is cannabis

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,480
humans have been turning to cannabis for

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,759
anxiety relief for thousands of years

18
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,479
and there are several different ways

19
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,399
that we can use cannabis to relieve

20
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,718
stress and we will discuss several of

21
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,280
them today today we're going to focus on

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,039
a brand new scientific study published

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,600
just last week looking at the

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,600
cannabinoid canaberal known as CBG to

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,838
reduce anxiety and the results are truly

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,599
remarkable and will absolutely influence

27
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:09,400
the direction of anxiety medicine

28
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,280
research going forward and how we as

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,640
cannabis enthusiasts avoid anxiety

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,320

and of course the shaping fire sessions

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,159
on the shaping fire YouTube channel

90
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,680
during the first set today we will

91
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:35,798
review what we know about CBG kabaj

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,799
gereral and look at the results of Prior

93
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,799
CBG studies we'll also discuss using

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,599
isolate versus whole plant preparations

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,319
during scientific research in the second

96
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,158
set we will review the mechanics of the

97
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,919
study and look pretty closely at the

98
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,039
various ways participants were made to

99
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,559
be anxious and the battery of skills

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,878
tests participants were given while

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,318
anxious and using CBG and during the

102
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,359
third set we will look at the

103
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,399
groundbreaking and really remarkable

104
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,319
results from this study and compare

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,360
using CBG to other cannabinoids like CBD

106
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:08,399
and THC for reducing anxiety welcome

107
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,319
back to shaping fire Dr

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,519
Russo well it's good to be back with you

109
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,560
excellent so Ethan you know why don't we

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,959
uh do something new and why don't we

111
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,040
start with um um giving some respect to

112
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,759
your other co-authors on this

113
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,639
paper ah sure happy to do that uh well

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,360
this was led by Dr Carrie Cutler of

115
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,759
Washington State University who's an

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,240
assoc a professor of psychology there

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,240
and has done fantastic work on cannabis

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,360
over the last several years also her

119
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,360
graduate student Amanda stuber did a lot

120
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:50,000
of the interviewing uh for folks in the

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,360
study and uh then Zea Cooper who's a

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,519
professor at UCLA and heads the Cannabis

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,919
research program there fantastic thank

124
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,198
you you know the more and more I get

125
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,839
into the science side uh depth in

126
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,520
cannabis the more I realize how

127
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,000
important every single person on a paper

128
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,399
is and so I think I I think I like this

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,519
and I think I'll I think we'll start

130
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,638
plugging those other uh co-authors as uh

131
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,198
going forward so thanks for that so

132
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,240
let's let's get started by creating a

133
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,038
little bit of context for canaba gerall

134
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,600
for folks who are relatively new to CBG

135
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:24,240
as a canabo now clearly throughout this

136
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,560
entire show we're going to be talking

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,720
about CBG in uh significant detail but

138
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,319
for the moment would you just give us a

139
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,800
General understanding of CBG as a

140
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:40,080
canabo yes happy to do that so uh let's

141
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:46,079
go back to 1964 that was the year that

142
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:50,120
Rafael mulam and yil goni um identified

143
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:53,439
finally uh THC tetr Hydro canaban as the

144
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,959
main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis

145
00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:00,560
but that same year uh they also

146
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:04,478
discovered canaba gereral and were quite

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,879
preed in identifying it as a precursor

148
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:13,279
to all the other major

149
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:15,598
canabo uh so it it started there uh

150
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,959
interestingly all the attention was

151
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:22,680
focused on

152
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:24,719
THC uh canaba uh had been discovered or

153
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,959
identified with

154
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,240
clear uh idea as to it structure only

155
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:35,918
the prior year in 196

156
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,680
63 but because there was not this um

157
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:41,519
overt psychoactivity to some of these

158
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,400
other compounds uh they got much less

159
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,439
attention and that was certainly the

160
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,439
case with canaba gereral so there were

161
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:54,759
some initial studies looking at what it

162
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:57,240
did in animals um uh but uh it really

163
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:01,120
didn't get the attention it deserved for

164
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:04,439
perhaps another 30 years or

165
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,598
more what would have caused the interest

166
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,560
in CBG to

167
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:12,279
increase well you know along the line

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,000
people did take a look at uh certain

169
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:21,399
things uh in the 70s it was shown that

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,639
uh CBG is an uptake inhibitor for Gaba

171
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,279
uh which is an inhibitory

172
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,560
neurotransmitter why that is important

173
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:33,559
is that it could account for muscle Rel

174
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:37,038
LAX in activity and certainly for some

175
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,478
uh activity as an anti-anxiety agent

176
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:44,000
which we certainly be talking about more

177
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:46,560
uh additionally in 2006 it was shown

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,800
that uh there was an anti-depressant

179
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,639
effect in tail suspension models and in

180
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,680
rodents uh along the way uh it was shown

181
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:02,079
that there is a mild effect of CBG to

182
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:06,639
lower blood pressure and also to lower

183
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:09,158
intraocular pressure the way THC does on

184
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,319
glaucoma um

185
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:15,038
subsequently uh during this

186
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,598
interval in the early 2000s there was a

187
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,079
lot more

188
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:23,800
investigation uh some of this was

189
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,719
spearheaded uh through support of GW

190
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,079
Pharmaceuticals where I was working at

191
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:33,158
the time on they had a uh program of

192
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:37,319
selective breeding for the so-called

193
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:40,958
minor canabo and one of those was

194
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:44,640
canaberal uh the chief breeder there

195
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:50,119
attend deer actually developed a CBG

196
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:54,519
only plant um and uh so that there was a

197
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:58,360
good bit of basic research going on um

198
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,039
among other things it was shown that um

199
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,360
CBG

200
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:08,399
stimulates uh several trip channels on

201
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,959
especially trip M8 m is sort of like uh

202
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,600
it's named for Menthol so this is a a

203
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:18,559
temperature sensitive receptor trip M8

204
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,360
is important because uh certain tumors

205
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:26,078
especially prostate cancer and some uh

206
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:30,600
breast cancer lines uh would be targets

207
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:33,838
for this um uh

208
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,519
additionally um there it was shown that

209
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,640
uh there were antibiotic effects a

210
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:44,679
strong effects uh against methylin

211
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:49,039
resistant staus orius that was shown by

212
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:52,278
appendino at all um this is an important

213
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,679
result uh because at the time there were

214
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:58,559
all these Hospital acquired infections

215
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:01,958
and many deaths related to Mera us s

216
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:05,759
remains in area of great interest so two

217
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:08,439
of the big things were this uh effect on

218
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:11,639
certain cancers uh and I should point

219
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,680
out that CBG like just about all the

220
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:18,759
other canabo shows a a great selectivity

221
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,120
and its ability to kill cancer cells

222
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,159
while being preservative for normal

223
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,320
cells this is an important distinction

224
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:30,559
because standard chemotherapy agents

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,120
tend to be toxic to cells and General so

226
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,518
it's always an issue of can you kill the

227
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,000
tumor before you kill the patient or at

228
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,039
least make them very sick in the process

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,278
so anybody who's been through

230
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:47,919
chemotherapy or has a family member or

231
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:51,879
friend that has is familiar with this

232
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:55,120
concept so with the canabo we have the

233
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:58,679
prospect of having much more

234
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,839
selective ability to kill cancer without

235
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,958
producing

236
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,480
overt

237
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,838
toxicity the study reminds us a couple

238
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,800
times that there are nearly no CBG

239
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,600
studies that involve humans and yet we

240
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,919
know you know quite a bit about CBG and

241
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,440
have um pretty good ideas about other

242
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,838
things we want to research in humans it

243
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,320
gives me kind of a vibe that that there

244
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:27,519
is a a bit of a sea change as far as

245
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,480
human research into CBG you know as

246
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,278
somebody who is doing this research on

247
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,720
the front lines do you feel that as well

248
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:37,360
that we're at a transition point where

249
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,560
um we're we're moving out of of purely

250
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,360
rodent studies and moving more and more

251
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:50,159
into CBG um studies in humans yes quite

252
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:52,839
true so why is that again uh for better

253
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:56,879
or worse there's been all this attention

254
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,959
on THC and then uh starting about 15

255
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:04,039
years ago CBD came to the four mainly

256
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:07,199
because of its utility in epilepsy uh

257
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:11,360
which is welld deserved but uh I think

258
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,079
people would understand that um CBD has

259
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,919
sort of peaked in terms of interest that

260
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:21,679
it it certainly is a very versatile

261
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:25,958
therapeutic molecule but um perhaps it

262
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:28,559
hasn't quite uh panned out uh from a

263
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:32,278
business standpoint that's certainly

264
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:35,919
true from many companies um so it's

265
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:38,320
pretty much everywhere but um again lost

266
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,319
in the shuffle were other candidates

267
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
particularly

268
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,600
CBG now that has changed recently

269
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,399
because certainly um on the west coast

270
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,720
of the US there has been selective

271
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:56,159
breeding again leading to CBG

272
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:59,399
predominant or CBG only kovar of

273
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:02,240
cannabis um this really started the

274
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:08,519
Northwest particularly with Oregon

275
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:11,600
CBD um and slowly uh CBG interest and

276
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:15,159
breeding has diffused to the rest of the

277
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,800
United States and around the world um so

278
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,719
along the line uh along the way

279
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,958
certainly there've been a lot of people

280
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,079
particularly in the Northwest us that

281
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:30,599
have been using CBG for some years now

282
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:32,958
um and so we have their what we'll call

283
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,320
what the scientists call anecdotal

284
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:39,159
experience What patients and consumers

285
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,040
report uh but it's only recently that

286
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:45,278
there have been the formal clinical

287
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:48,278
studies um and we' like to think that

288
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:51,399
we've been at the Forefront of that uh

289
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:55,320
with our surve survey study that was

290
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:59,919
published in 2021 and now this which was

291
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:03,639
the first study to examine a randomized

292
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:06,000
control trial the effect of CBG on

293
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:10,079
anxiety I have to agree with you Ethan

294
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,440
that it is no small impact that the CBG

295
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:16,159
dominant cultivars from uh Seth and Eric

296
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,160
Crawford there at Oregon CBD down in

297
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,838
Albany Oregon has really made a

298
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,838
difference here in the Pacific Northwest

299
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:27,160
because up until their CBG dominant

300
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:30,440
cultivar mostly we were getting CBG in

301
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:33,198
um THC dominant Cult of and it's really

302
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,800
hard to tell anything either in a

303
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,399
controlled study or just anecdotally

304
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:41,159
when THC is the primary ingredient but

305
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,440
when you can strip that out and make a

306
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:48,439
CBG dominant hemp cultivar where um you

307
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,680
know it's nearly entirely CBG this opens

308
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,959
up not only the ability for um that

309
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,559
plant material to find its way to

310
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:59,479
research scientists like you but also it

311
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,159
really gives a lot of strength to what

312
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,519
you know some call anecdotal evidence

313
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,759
some call citizen science the the whole

314
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,720
idea that that it gets its hand uh uh

315
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,159
CBG gets itself into the hands of

316
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,879
caregivers who are who don't don't

317
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,639
really have the same constraints as as

318
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,879
legitimate science do and so a lot of

319
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:21,360
the initial you know grunt work about

320
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,639
what we should even look for can happen

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,560
and I'm really grateful for those you

322
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,720
know single canabo dominant cultivars

323
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,758
and and hopefully we'll continue to be

324
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,519
seeing more of them a uh yes certainly

325
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,159
um you know this is the kind of

326
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:42,159
selective breeding that took place at uh

327
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,559
GW Pharmaceuticals unfortunately because

328
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,519
there was a concentration on development

329
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:51,559
of satx and

330
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:54,799
epidex CBG again never got into clinical

331
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:59,039
trials um despite the availability of a

332
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,399
CBG only K of our uh clear back uh you

333
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,838
know in the early

334
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,919
2000s um so it's just one of those

335
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,240
things that got lost in the

336
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,039
shuffle you know uh you may not be able

337
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,159
to speak to this and and and and my my

338
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,078
awareness might not even be true but

339
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,719
it's it seems to me that that there's

340
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,599
probably a whole bunch of really

341
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,519
interesting cultiv ours at GW that that

342
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,839
just like you said kind of got lost in

343
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:27,480
the mix and it isn't until similar Cult

344
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,279
of ours are are rebred in the public

345
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,639
that we see a lot of those cuz most of

346
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,879
the pharmaceutical companies you know

347
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:37,959
defend that cherished IP I would

348
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:40,198
assume right yeah so you know you've

349
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,559
been researching CBG for years and you

350
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,639
and I have been talking about it for

351
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:47,159
years now and this particular study

352
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,519
though um seems like it's a direct

353
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,879
follow-up to another one that you did

354
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,759
just a couple years back again with Dr

355
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,439
Carrie Cutler at Washington State

356
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,759
University uh a bit more of a general

357
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,000
study but it absolutely sets this one up

358
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,959
would you summarize that study and its

359
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,679
results so that we can all have a better

360
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:10,119
picture of what we're building on top of

361
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,519
uh sure so at that time we weren't in a

362
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:17,119
position yet to do a randomized control

363
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:21,400
trial first um I thought that we really

364
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:24,159
needed a survey a decent survey of what

365
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,120
people were reporting with

366
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,640
CBG uh

367
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,879
preparations um to lend some Credence to

368
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,640
the idea that number one this could be

369
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,160
used therapeutically number two that

370
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:45,600
there weren't any Associated problems so

371
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:49,200
we initiated a survey study and had 127

372
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,199
folks that

373
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,559
um the stipulation was they had to be

374
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:00,200
adults and they had to be using a

375
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:04,000
preparation that was at least 50% C CBG

376
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,880
so that was a mixed uh sort of sample

377
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,798
some of the people were using CBG only

378
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:15,039
products but a lot of them um

379
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:17,200
were CBG with THC and as you mentioned

380
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,839
that creates a a few

381
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,360
complications but uh for the most part

382
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:26,639
we got some very useful

383
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:30,959
information um so uh yeah let's let's

384
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:34,080
talk about what people saw mhm first um

385
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,679
what I expected was um something we did

386
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,119
see that a lot of people were using it

387
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:43,038
for the big three which are treatment of

388
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:47,279
pain help with sleep and uh mood

389
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:50,200
particularly um anxiety uh so these are

390
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:54,359
the same things for which many people

391
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:58,558
turn to cannabis uh of one type or

392
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,879
another but when we started asking about

393
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,079
condition conditions that people were

394
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,960
treating we got a list of 30 different

395
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:08,480
conditions and what was really

396
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,880
surprising was uh people reported that

397
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,480
the CBG preparations were highly

398
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,919
effective and often much more so than

399
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,200
conventional medicines that they' used

400
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,240
for the same

401
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:27,000
purposes um and we got uh very highly St

402
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:32,480
statistical significance with claims of

403
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,440
benefit on pain uh sleep anxiety but

404
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,839
also for some

405
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,720
hardcore uh medical conditions like uh

406
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,678
inflammatory bowel

407
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,880
disease uh

408
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,320
endometriosis now some of the numbers

409
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,679
weren't big on those specifics but when

410
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,839
3/4 of the people are saying that this

411
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,679
is the best medicine that they've ever

412
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:59,918
used uh for their condition you know it

413
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:04,400
is creating a s signal that deserves

414
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:07,720
attention um now at the same time uh

415
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,600
people were really not reporting side

416
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,600
effects to speak of some people reported

417
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:17,279
dry mouth sleepiness increased appetite

418
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:19,879
but certainly that would suggest that

419
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:24,240
those were preparations that had some

420
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:27,880
THC um in them um and this is born out

421
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,599
subsequently when we looked specifically

422
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,799
just at a CBG only

423
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:38,079
preparation similarly uh in the

424
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:42,319
survey um 84% reported no withdrawal

425
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:45,960
symptoms when they stopped um so you

426
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:49,000
know our conclusions were first this was

427
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,038
the first study that really looked at

428
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,839
therapeutic use of of CBG in

429
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:58,038
humans uh again anxiety pain depression

430
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,158
and insomnia were the most commonly

431
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:05,919
reported Target symptoms and people

432
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:10,278
reported a very high efficacy with uh no

433
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,520
Adverse Events to speak of um and you

434
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:16,159
know the the main thing was we thought

435
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,440
that this is a good indicator that CBG

436
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,640
would be safe for future randomized

437
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,679
control

438
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,880
trials um now we were immediately

439
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:28,159
interested in taking this forward but it

440
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,679
it took a good long time um as these

441
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,720
things often do uh recruitment for the

442
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,400
new

443
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:41,880
study which was again a randomized

444
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:45,640
control trial of a CBG only kov

445
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,880
extract um and its effect on

446
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,880
anxiety um this took a while to recruit

447
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,600
it it was confined to people in

448
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:59,360
Washington state because uh that's what

449
00:21:54,599 --> 00:22:04,439
the institutional review board wanted um

450
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:07,079
but um it it came together nicely

451
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,919
um so why don't I stop there for a

452
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,319
second see if you have an interim

453
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:14,600
question because I could just go on sure

454
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:17,879
sure sure so um I find it interesting

455
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,959
that it was challenging to uh recruit

456
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,799
for this study I mean not only were you

457
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,880
limited to Washington which has you know

458
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,519
got its own challenges as since you've

459
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,080
got a national audience but even more so

460
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,599
after reading the study um I can imagine

461
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,558
that it that it may have been

462
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,599
challenging to find people who met your

463
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:40,000
stipulations because in one hand for

464
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:43,199
somebody to be open to participating in

465
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,119
a cannabis study they need to be open to

466
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:52,120
cannabis but then the study required for

467
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:55,119
them to not be using cannabis or any

468
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,519
other air quotes illicit drugs during I

469
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:01,158
think it was a two or three month window

470
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,798
and and so many people you know were

471
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,840
they they they may have had cannabis or

472
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,879
they may have been micro doing or may

473
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:09,038
have done a lot of things so this this

474
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,520
this actually continues to make the pool

475
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:14,278
of people possible much smaller right

476
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:18,759
well that's a problem in general in this

477
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:23,880
instance we ask that people not use

478
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:25,679
cannabis um for 24 hours oh um so you

479
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,080
know in some studies they're much more

480
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,640
stringent about that um we also wanted

481
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:39,399
people that were cannabis familiar uh

482
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:41,200
but not necessarily heavy users um so um

483
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,480
and that's that's walk in a line right

484
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,679
there well sure you know there are

485
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,120
always exclusion criteria uh we wanted

486
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,840
to exclude people that might have felt

487
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:58,519
that they had us CBG before and had a

488
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:02,079
bad reaction they couldn't use um harder

489
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:04,839
drugs within 2 months um they couldn't

490
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:07,839
have a serious psych psychiatric

491
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:10,000
condition like schizophrenia or

492
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,000
bipolarity uh they couldn't be pregnant

493
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,319
or

494
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
breastfeeding and they couldn't have any

495
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:22,759
chronic neurologic disorder or history

496
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:26,599
of a a serious head injury um uh so I

497
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:29,278
mean those were the the kinds of things

498
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:32,000
um and um

499
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:35,000
oh they also uh had to be fluent in

500
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,119
English they had to have a smartphone

501
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,480
because one of the tests was done on an

502
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:43,359
app uh on a

503
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,640
smartphone and as mentioned previously

504
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:49,158
uh just in Washington state so there

505
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,399
were no issues about shipping product

506
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:55,679
over state lines so that might have

507
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:58,759
attracted Federal interest let's say

508
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
yeah well there was um I found it

509
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:01,720
interesting because you know when you

510
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,398
reached out that that you were going to

511
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,399
be working on this study I was excited

512
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:07,119
to participate and then and then I

513
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:11,359
didn't get through the first sifting

514
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:13,319
process because my uh my my association

515
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,439
with cannabis and and other influences

516
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,038
were were far too high for the study but

517
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,519
I am happy to say that we let uh shaping

518
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:24,640
fire user or not users shaping fire

519
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,119
listeners uh know about the study and

520
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,559
and uh you have some of them in your

521
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:32,038
study so thanks to everybody who who

522
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,519
chose to participate so so we talked

523
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:37,079
about the the the the Baseline study

524
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:39,119
that you did with Dr Cutler uh over

525
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,879
there at Washington State University

526
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,918
that that laid down the base and so then

527
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,840
you worked with Dr card to design this

528
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,120
new study what were the objectives for

529
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:54,439
this new

530
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:56,678
study um it it was again to see if um in

531
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,200
a sort of

532
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,840
manufactured situation creating anxiety

533
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,278
that we could show that cpg made a

534
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:09,439
difference compared to Placebo and I I

535
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:14,038
just wanted to go back uh for a second

536
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,798
to um the demographics of um people's

537
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:21,000
canabus use um because this is important

538
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:23,359
a lot of studies um you know for

539
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,759
instance in the survey obviously wanted

540
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:29,918
people that had used CBG

541
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:33,038
before uh in this one it we hoped that

542
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,640
we'd get some people that never use CBG

543
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,839
and uh because this is really important

544
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,320
what's the reaction of it to somebody

545
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,240
that's never had it before so as it

546
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,319
turned out

547
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:50,359
65% of the people in the study which was

548
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:53,359
34 had no prior experience using canaba

549
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:57,359
jural uh again all had been cannabis

550
00:26:53,359 --> 00:27:00,798
users in the past uh the average was

551
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:04,519
about 3 and half half days a week or 18

552
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:09,480
days a month okay but with that in mind

553
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:12,759
um you know again um what were the what

554
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,880
was the premise of the study um well

555
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:18,558
I'll just read from the purpose to

556
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:23,960
examine the acute effects of hemp

557
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:27,319
derived CBG on anxiety stress mood and

558
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,720
memory as well as positive and negative

559
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:32,798
subjective drug effects in humans and

560
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,440
the design is what's called a double

561
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:39,599
blind meaning patients and the

562
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,200
administers of uh this didn't know who

563
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:45,000
was getting what at the time Placebo

564
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,759
controlled that means that on one

565
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,839
occasion people got the CBG preparation

566
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:54,640
on another occasion they got a

567
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:59,558
placebo um and it was called a crossover

568
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,960
study because uh they had to take both

569
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:06,038
in separate trials and it's called a

570
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:10,079
field trial because um this was done

571
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:14,038
over Zoom with patients in their home

572
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:17,158
environment um and

573
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:19,879
um someone asking the questions on the

574
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,278
other end at Washington State

575
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,159
University I can imagine that um asking

576
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,720
people their questions at home actually

577
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,840
gets rid of an entire uh layer of

578
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,839
anxiety related questions that that you

579
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,918
don't have to do anymore since people

580
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,398
are often made to feel anxious just by

581
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,200
coming into a facility right that's

582
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,759
called white coat anxiety oh and we use

583
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,600
that to Advantage wait wait wait did you

584
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:48,119
say white coat anxiety yeah that's

585
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,678
that's apply named okay go ahead sure we

586
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,158
use that to Advantage though because uh

587
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:56,000
part of the testing was I mean some of

588
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,679
this is diabolical how do we make PE

589
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,679
people anxious uh well one of the things

590
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,600
was um they were told that they had five

591
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:10,278
minutes to

592
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:13,038
prepare um to say um what their ideal

593
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:16,720
job would be and how they were qualified

594
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,919
for it and um you know they were

595
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,640
expected to talk this whole time and if

596
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:28,120
they stopped talking they would um be

597
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:32,278
prompted to continue um and um the exam

598
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:34,398
Amer uh did a thing of starting out in

599
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:37,200
civilian clothing and then coming back

600
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:41,359
in a white coat and then there was a

601
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,720
thing of a calculation usually uh the

602
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,918
usual calculation when you're testing

603
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,640
someone cognitively is to trct subtract

604
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,278
seven from 100 this is much worse it

605
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,759
started with a very high number

606
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:57,278
subtracting

607
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:59,440
17 and every time a mistake was made

608
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,880
they were told to go back to the

609
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,240
beginning um so these are the Diabolical

610
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,120
ways that you induce anxiety in a

611
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,880
laboratory setting yeah well um it's

612
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:12,879
amazing how how effective they are for

613
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,320
being so gentle right because you're

614
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,559
you're not actually putting them under

615
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,319
threat but it sure can feel like it and

616
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,119
and we'll be talking more about those in

617
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,678
the second set too because this battery

618
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:25,359
of test that you gave people um were

619
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,480
something else um for this set let's

620
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,599
finish with this though you know most

621
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,720
studies

622
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,519
um that are happening on cannabis

623
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,600
nowadays they default to using isolate

624
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:41,319
um even though I prefer whole resin most

625
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:43,398
studies are using isolate because um it

626
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,678
is uh you know just one specific

627
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:47,759
molecule instead of being the Cannabis

628
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,320
resin which has got lots of components

629
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:55,558
in it um and yet we know that uh

630
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:58,720
generally speaking a using resin offers

631
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:01,480
better benefits from isolate which has

632
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:06,120
got its own problems why did you choose

633
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,399
to go with a whole plant CBG dominant

634
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:11,638
resin solution in the tincture for the

635
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:14,359
study instead of going with isolate

636
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:16,839
which is probably more easily available

637
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,798
and also is what you know what all your

638
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:21,720
peers and pharmace pharmaceuticals are

639
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:26,638
doing well we wanted Real World

640
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:30,240
Experience now again this the study drug

641
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:33,119
was a cpgxy extract that has been used

642
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,200
by a good number of people uh in the

643
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,959
Pacific

644
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,000
Northwest uh so we knew a little bit

645
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:44,038
about what to expect from it uh that was

646
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,278
a big Advantage we definitely wanted uh

647
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:50,919
CBG only preparation to the extent that

648
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:53,240
there'd be no THC no significant amount

649
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:58,120
of CBD or other

650
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:01,519
canabo and in fact um each milliliter

651
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:04,239
the study drug had 10 milligram of

652
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:10,000
CBG a little bit of

653
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:12,319
cbga um there were barely any THC

654
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,599
01 milligram of

655
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:18,359
THC and the only significant turpenoid

656
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:21,918
was. 35 Mig of

657
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:23,678
caropine which we don't expect to be

658
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,000
overtly

659
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:32,559
psychoactive so each

660
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,599
person in the study drug uh set um got 2

661
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:38,879
Mill of this material in a glass of

662
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:43,879
water so that was 20 milligrams of CBG

663
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:47,840
and not a lot uh else now it was a real

664
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,480
challenge to figure out a placebo so the

665
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:54,038
placebo would be something that wouldn't

666
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,839
be psychoactive to any great

667
00:32:54,038 --> 00:33:02,200
extent but it it should look like the

668
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:06,439
study drug and and have a taste uh that

669
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,919
might be hard to tell apart so I racked

670
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,120
my brain this was part of my

671
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,559
contribution to the study um what could

672
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:18,079
we use that would have this

673
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:20,960
effect um so I wondered how about an

674
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:24,839
herbal preparation but one that wouldn't

675
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,360
have canabo in it and um we want

676
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,759
something that's sort of green like the

677
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,119
the Stu drug so I I thought about the

678
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,278
lur

679
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:38,959
chartreuse for people who don't know

680
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:41,679
chartreuse is um uh from Europe hundreds

681
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,519
of years old originally made by monks

682
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:49,240
said to be made uh with somewhere

683
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,558
between 50 and 100 different herbs it

684
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,839
has a distinct herbal taste and it is

685
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,398
green um so we use that um as the

686
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:02,519
placebo

687
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:05,038
um uh when when I read that in the study

688
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:08,800
Ethan I just howled sitting in my living

689
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:11,800
room um because number one it's it's

690
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,720
really humorous to see chartreuse so out

691
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,359
of place and in the wild like I'm you

692
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,439
know I was a bartender uh in my 20s and

693
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,759
30s so I was of course very familiar

694
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,960
with chartreuse but I didn't expect to

695
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,919
see it in the study while I was I was

696
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,199
reading it and then it makes so much

697
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,078
sense because uh even though chartreuse

698
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,719
has got a certain sweetness to it it is

699
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,240
so herbal and when you watered it way

700
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,000
down I totally see how it could become

701
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,559
an

702
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,159
effective um you know Placebo that that

703
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:45,320
act that looks and and and acts like a

704
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,519
tincture without the Active Components

705
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,720
uh did you find that it worked out

706
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:50,878
pretty well because I would think that

707
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:55,559
that would be a home run uh sure you

708
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:58,239
know I nobody said uh that I'm aware of

709
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:02,039
um that we know this is the drug and we

710
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:05,199
know that this one isn't um so and you

711
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:10,719
know again uh people were sent vials

712
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:13,118
that had a color code on them um uh uh

713
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,799
and the person administering didn't know

714
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,240
what was what um you know this is a way

715
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,800
to maintain the Blind and we think it

716
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,799
was quite effective in this instance

717
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,240
right on and you know since since the

718
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,079
name of the individual is in the study

719
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:29,959
we might as well go ahead and mention

720
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,280
who provid Ed the CBD tincture for the

721
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,400
study they might find that

722
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,839
novel uh yes this came from when

723
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,559
Shango oh

724
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:43,279
me yeah well I I was happy to do my bit

725
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,279
for science Ethan so I am grateful to

726
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,760
have

727
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,519
participated so um all right so let's go

728
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,920
ahead and take our first break when we

729
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:55,119
get back we're going to talk a lot about

730
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,800
the battery of tests that were given to

731
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,559
um the research participants because

732
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,240
since this study is pointing

733
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:06,279
specifically to um how CBG helps with

734
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,639
anxiety um it's going to be very

735
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,200
interesting to look at these different

736
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:12,598
tests and figure out how they tease at

737
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,559
anxiety different ways so you are

does not have to be all whizbang smoke

819
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,960
prefer just to be spoken to calmly

820
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,160
accurately and with good intentions if

821
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,920
you want to make your own commercial

822
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:33,199
spot well you can do that too during

824

nothing added real fish poop is

846
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:33,519
extraordinarily complex not only are you

847
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:35,519
adding the nitrogen phosphorus and

848
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,960
potassium your plants need to build mass

transport nutrients and enhance flavor

00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,000
but fish waste is also packed with

851
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:44,639
biological activity and

852
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,880
micronutrients when you add fish poop to

853
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,480
your irrigation water you are adding

854
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,079
life force probiotics and active

855
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,358
microbes these microorganisms include a

856
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,000
wealth of various bacteria and protozoa

857
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:58,400
which further enhance nutrient

858
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,280
availability for the plant

859
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,760
because plants are limited by the

860
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,599
absence of any essential micronutrient

861
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,560
these Trace nutrients are the difference

862
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,039

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,880
are listening to shaping fire I'm your

892
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,920
host Shango and my guest today is

893
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:26,000
neurologist Dr Ethan Russo so before the

894
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:29,680
break we were talking about um the study

895
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,480
that this new study was based on um the

896
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:34,799
various advantages that we're starting

897
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,920
to see teased out of CBG and

898
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,480
specifically this study how it looked at

899
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,639
the anxiety of patients and cvg's

900
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:48,079
ability to decrease that anxiety and it

901
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:50,838
how the study is designed is remarkable

902
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,240
because what it has to do is is subtly

903
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:56,078
push people's buttons in different ways

904
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:59,479
and see whether or not um they can

905
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,240
handle have their anxiety buttons pushed

906
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,358
um with the study drug versus the

907
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:07,639
placebo which we now know was just very

908
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:10,558
watered down sh Truse so the study

909
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:13,279
consisted of two interviews between the

910
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,680
research assistant and the participant

911
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,640
one week apart via Zoom so before the

912
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:22,399
interview the research subject ingests a

913
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:26,039
vial of either 20 milligram of whole

914
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,720
plant CBG tincture or the watered down

915
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:31,000
chartreuse place IO then when the

916
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,519
interviewer starts some baseline

917
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,679
demographic questions are asked just to

918
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:37,960
kind of like get him talking but then a

919
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,719
whole battery of tests take place and I

920
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,159
got to say Ethan reading about them in

921
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,558
the study they really seem numerous and

922
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:47,118
varied and designed to stress like any

923
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:50,480
kind of person out in a way that doesn't

924
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,640
do any permanent damage so um I know

925
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,519
we've got you know a handful of them and

926
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,519
they all work in slightly different ways

927
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:58,759
so I think I just want to hand you the

928
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:01,880
mic and let you walk us through these

929
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:06,280
bious tests and teach us what they are

930
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:10,160
and and what their goal was sure so uh

931
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:14,480
at the zero point they had Baseline

932
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:17,318
assessments mood anxiety stress and drug

933
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,639
effects uh it may seem strange to ask

934
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:23,279
about drug effect questions when

935
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:25,318
nothing's on board but you you want to

936
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,519
establish uh

937
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:31,759
comparison um before the drug is

938
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:36,159
administered so at that time as you

939
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,880
mentioned they take the CBG tincture or

940
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:42,719
the uh chartreuse

941
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,920
Placebo um then they take an online

942
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:50,118
survey using uh up some time and the

943
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,720
first testing was at the 20 minute Mark

944
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:56,358
and I want to mention here we got a

945
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:58,558
criticism uh from One reviewer about you

946
00:44:56,358 --> 00:45:02,400
know why did you start then probably

947
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:06,119
wasn't doing anything but in the interim

948
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:10,280
there was a pharmacokinetics study done

949
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:12,160
pharmacokinetics is what are the effects

950
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,599
uh how long does it take for certain

951
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:18,598
effects to appear and we were able to

952
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:22,800
show that when people took CBG

953
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:27,480
orally uh that the effects begin

954
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,039
um and are seemingly well established by

955
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,199
the 20 minute

956
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:35,199
mark So at the 20 minute Mark there were

957
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:36,199
tests of mood anxiety stress and drug

958
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,719
effect

959
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:43,199
ratings then um they take the thing

960
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:46,239
called a trior social stress test they

961
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:51,399
be get more uh ratings of all those

962
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:54,799
parameters at 45 minutes um and then um

963
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:58,358
between 45 and 60 Minutes they'd have

964
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,599
the California verbal learning test to

965
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:04,960
which assesses memory impairment and

966
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:09,000
they'd have the Druid application uh

967
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:12,639
Druid is an app that's designed to

968
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,119
assess motor and reaction times and

969
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,639
whether someone's impaired um and you

970
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,880
know this is something that's been

971
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:24,719
validated and it's done on a smartphone

972
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,519
and then uh at time 3 it's 60 minutes

973
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:30,480
again the mood anxiety stress and drug

974
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:33,960
effect ratings so there were different

975
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:38,838
time points and as you mentioned these

976
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:42,440
different types of of testing um to see

977
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:45,880
uh What uh would

978
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:50,318
happen so in choosing these studies did

979
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:53,440
you approach them as okay these are the

980
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:56,039
studies that are always used by

981
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,280
scientists um who study anxiety like

982
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:01,838
where this is a preset battery or you or

983
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,599
did you as the designer of the study

984
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:07,078
have to go and choose these yourself off

985
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:08,838
the shelf um because they're the ones

986
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:12,000
that you respect and the ones that are

987
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:14,199
were going to tease out the kind of um

988
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,800
data points that you wanted to look at

989
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:17,919
I'm just trying to figure out whether or

990
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,119
not these are like boilerplate studies

991
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,960
or whether or not um this is more of a

992
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,559
custom or deal well you know there are

993
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:31,639
always differences but uh these are well

994
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:32,680
accepted um types of studies to look at

995
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:35,719
these

996
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:37,960
parameters um so basically what I could

997
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:41,959
say if you looked at studies from Johns

998
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:45,440
Hopkins like the lyine and THC study we

999
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,679
just did lot of overlap in the tests

1000
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,838
that were done uh and that's for a

1001
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:54,639
reason these are - tested measures uh

1002
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:57,199
that are well accepted uh in the

1003
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:01,078
scientific Community when you you look

1004
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:02,799
at these tests uh and H I think I want

1005
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,839
to come about this a different way we

1006
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,440
know that anxiety comes in a lot of

1007
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:10,358
different forms and and you know people

1008
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,519
on Vashon Island here where I live have

1009
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:17,078
been taking CBG tincture for a couple

1010
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:18,679
years and and the results that people

1011
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:21,039
speak back

1012
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:24,759
anecdotally they they review different

1013
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:27,880
types of anxiety that the tinure helps

1014
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:30,839
with as you were designing the study

1015
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:34,240
what were you looking to pull out of the

1016
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:36,039
various um the V various tests that you

1017
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,000
were giving folks and and I'm not asking

1018
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,279
you to necessarily go through them all

1019
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,440
but but so we can understand how to

1020
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,400
scientifically think through these tests

1021
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,920
would you maybe compare two or three of

1022
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,680
them and say well this one is looking at

1023
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,519
this type of anxiety versus this one's

1024
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:53,239
looking at the different type of anxiety

1025
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:55,559
because unfortunately most people who

1026
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:58,879
who have anxiety they just say I'm

1027
00:48:55,559 --> 00:49:00,720
anxious without the ever having had the

1028
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,358
opportunity to think about what kind of

1029
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:06,000
anxiety they may have yeah well there

1030
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:09,199
are different types uh free floating

1031
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,559
anxiety so-called would just be feeling

1032
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:16,039
anxious in general situ situational

1033
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,280
anxiety would be I get stressed when I

1034
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:21,599
have to go

1035
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:25,280
outside um but um

1036
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,798
again and I although I was a psych major

1037
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,160
in college I'm not an an expert on this

1038
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:36,838
but I can assure you that Dr Cutler and

1039
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:39,039
Dr Cooper are um but uh again um one of

1040
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:43,358
the tests is called a state

1041
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:45,000
anxiety um and um another is more

1042
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:50,838
specific for

1043
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,920
stress um as as might be precipitated by

1044
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:57,239
subtracting 17 from a high number and

1045
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:00,519
having to repeat it um so I don't think

1046
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:05,118
I've given you a great answer but um

1047
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:07,960
what I can say is that over time we saw

1048
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:11,119
these statistically significant

1049
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:16,519
differences in the these folks tested

1050
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:20,480
twice between their uh experience on the

1051
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:22,639
CBG and their experience on the placebo

1052
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,079
and because you know it wasn't always

1053
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:29,879
one before the other it was random as to

1054
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:32,640
which came first you can control um so

1055
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,119
it's not a matter of well you know I'm

1056
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:37,920
not stressed because I I knew they were

1057
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,519
going to subtract SE have me subtract 17

1058
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:45,240
from a high number and it wasn't as bad

1059
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:47,559
the second time um in general um these

1060
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:50,239
are set up in a way that uh there

1061
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:52,798
shouldn't be these big practice

1062
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,719
effects um I want to poke at that a

1063
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:56,798
little bit the the term practice effects

1064
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,000
is one I'm unfamiliar with so that might

1065
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:00,920
be what I'm asking about but okay so

1066
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
let's assume that the tincture that is

1067
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,440
was the CBG tinure presented a certain

1068
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
way and then the chartreuse presented a

1069
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,720
certain way and they both seemed like

1070
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,960
they could have been the CBG tinure

1071
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:14,759
which was the goal so that's great but

1072
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:18,240
we those of us who who do use CBG

1073
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:20,720
regularly it really has a a huge effect

1074
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,919
on on anxiety in my own personal

1075
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:27,199
experience I I have experienced this so

1076
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:30,400
do you have a data point that speaks all

1077
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:33,159
to um to what

1078
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,240
degree uh the the test subjects were

1079
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:38,879
able to determine which one was likely

1080
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:41,719
the study drug not not based on

1081
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,559
presentation but based on based on oh my

1082
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:45,919
God this works so much better than the

1083
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,000
one other one I had the other one must

1084
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,760
have been the

1085
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:55,960
placebo well uh you know I we didn't

1086
00:51:50,760 --> 00:52:01,799
record people's reaction that way um you

1087
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:04,798
don't want to probe too deeply at this

1088
00:52:01,798 --> 00:52:09,960
point when you're trying to get two sets

1089
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:13,719
of data points and again you might get

1090
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,720
varying degrees of response in an

1091
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:21,078
individual but you need numbers in this

1092
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:23,838
instance 34 folks to see what the

1093
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:27,359
overall effect is and whether it has

1094
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:30,039
statistical significance so my answer to

1095
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:36,000
your very pertinent question

1096
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:38,159
is we rate the benefit in terms of

1097
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,838
statistics um

1098
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,000
and now I need to give a little primer

1099
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:44,000
on

1100
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,400
statistics

1101
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,679
um statistics the the lower the number

1102
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:54,559
is the more significant it is something

1103
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:58,118
is considered medically

1104
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,359
significant if it has a probability or P

1105
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:03,280
value under

1106
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:06,358
05 what that means is there's less than

1107
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:10,079
a chance One Chance in 20 that the

1108
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:14,480
results occurred due to chance meaning

1109
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:18,079
that when it's 05 or less we consider

1110
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,519
that likely a real effect and then as

1111
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:24,119
the numbers are smaller it's more

1112
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:28,838
statistically significant so in this

1113
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:34,039
instance um the subjective

1114
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:38,000
anxiety uh ratios there was a moderately

1115
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:41,000
large size significant effect of the

1116
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
condition meaning one versus the other

1117
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,960
that P value was

1118
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,679
034 so under the

1119
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:53,280
05 and over time it was very significant

1120
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:57,239
so uh P value of

1121
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,480
0.001 that means one chance in a th000

1122
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:03,118
that this could be just a chance

1123
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:06,559
occurrence that's a real effect anytime

1124
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,559
there's one chance in a th000 uh that

1125
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:12,559
you know

1126
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:14,559
this it it it really is highly

1127
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,240
statistically

1128
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:21,599
significant um similarly the stress

1129
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:23,798
ratings um the effect over time uh P

1130
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:28,559
value of

1131
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:30,960
0.001 um and um a large siiz simple

1132
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:34,359
effect of the condition on the change in

1133
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:37,318
subjective stress ratings again a

1134
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:41,838
032 it's under the

1135
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:44,838
05 um but at the same time there were

1136
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:48,239
not major changes in in

1137
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:52,719
mood um the thing called the state

1138
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:55,000
anxiety scores uh again showed a large

1139
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,759
statistically significant main effect

1140
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,798
over time

1141
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,680
.1 now if we were looking at the graphs

1142
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,639
from the study you can see that there's

1143
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,759
a

1144
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:12,440
clear demarcation there's space between

1145
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:15,960
the effects on Placebo and the effects

1146
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:20,159
on CBG and the bigger the space between

1147
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:22,599
those the more significant it is um in

1148
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:27,159
these you can see that the differences

1149
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:30,480
are pretty clear um you know again this

1150
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:31,960
wasn't a situation where we asked people

1151
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,000
for a lot of

1152
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:37,720
introspection on what they thought was

1153
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,639
going on it it really had to be

1154
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:45,679
objective meaning what did the test show

1155
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:47,960
um uh so you know it would have been

1156
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:48,838
interesting to ask people more about

1157
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,599
their

1158
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:54,519
reactions so that's one thing we showed

1159
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:58,119
these clear

1160
00:55:54,519 --> 00:56:00,639
statistical and significant changes

1161
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:02,119
looking at anxiety and stress with these

1162
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:07,239
standardized

1163
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:10,519
measures um but um at what cost in other

1164
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:13,838
words were the people impaired when this

1165
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:18,679
happened I mean you can make someone no

1166
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:20,920
longer anxious by sedating them um so

1167
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:23,960
what would really be important is to

1168
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:26,280
have benefit on anx anxiety without

1169
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:29,920
sedation so we looked at other measur

1170
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:34,798
meur es one was a measure of

1171
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:37,480
intoxication so this is a a place where

1172
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:40,358
if there were a lot of THC you'd expect

1173
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,358
you get significant difference between

1174
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:46,798
that preparation and

1175
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:50,519
Placebo um we also had drug effect

1176
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,679
ratings and this is asking people about

1177
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:55,318
their

1178
00:56:51,679 --> 00:57:00,318
reactions and um how much they like the

1179
00:56:55,318 --> 00:57:03,798
drug uh so most often cannabis users in

1180
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:06,199
a clinical trial setting will report

1181
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:10,358
that they liked a certain amount of

1182
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:13,318
THC so three measures there but we saw

1183
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:16,358
no significant differences between the

1184
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:19,358
canaberal and the placebo at any time

1185
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:22,920
point with respect to intoxication

1186
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:26,239
ratings there were almost straight lines

1187
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:30,200
same with drug effect and same with drug

1188
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:33,078
liking so no space between the lines at

1189
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:36,639
the three time points 20 minutes 45

1190
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:40,280
minutes and 60 minutes this is really

1191
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:44,639
remarkable because if you test any other

1192
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:46,359
drug used for anxiety like azod dipene

1193
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,719
Valium

1194
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:52,639
diazapam um almost always there's going

1195
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:55,879
to be significant sedation or other

1196
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:59,480
complaints and we just didn't see that

1197
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:02,480
and then there's another dimension

1198
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,480
here

1199
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:10,000
um I'm sorry I want to talk a little

1200
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:15,598
more about uh subjective drug effects um

1201
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:19,280
so these are rated zero to um zero not

1202
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:21,880
at all to 10 extreme um and again there

1203
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:25,319
were no significant differences between

1204
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:29,920
CBG and Placebo at any of the three time

1205
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:32,679
points 20 minutes 45 minutes or 60

1206
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:37,358
Minutes um

1207
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:38,679
then uh again if we have a drug that's

1208
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,558
good for

1209
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:45,960
anxiety um we want to make sure that

1210
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:48,720
it's not producing any impairment so

1211
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,679
memory tests were part of the

1212
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:55,399
trials um then a very surprising and

1213
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:58,719
important thing happened which was

1214
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:01,480
people on the CBG actually did me better

1215
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,959
on memory tests and this was St

1216
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,119
statistically

1217
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:10,318
significant um so there was a moderate

1218
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:14,318
size significant effect of the condition

1219
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:18,038
uh and that's at the the probability 05

1220
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:21,239
level and a large statistically

1221
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:23,480
significant effect over time meaning

1222
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:28,439
looking at all the time points and that

1223
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:32,798
P value was 0. one so that supports the

1224
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:35,639
idea that on this verbal memory test

1225
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:39,440
that the performance was significantly

1226
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:43,598
better on CBG than it was on Placebo

1227
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:46,039
this is not what you expect um from most

1228
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:49,640
studies of this type especially on

1229
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:53,680
cannabis yeah exactly but again lacking

1230
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:55,519
THC cpg is a different kettle of fish it

1231
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:56,838
really is distinctly different in what

1232
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:00,759
it does

1233
00:59:56,838 --> 01:00:01,639
um and to me this might be the the most

1234
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,920
uh

1235
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:05,759
surprising finding yeah it was

1236
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,880
definitely surprising to me reading it

1237
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,760
it was actually kind of like a plot

1238
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,760
twist in a book as I was reading the

1239
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,440
study I'm like oh I I didn't know that

1240
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,400
was here and I didn't certainly didn't

1241
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,119
expect it coming I I I believe that this

1242
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,639
next question is outside the scope of

1243
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,519
the study but as a neurologist and as

1244
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,078
somebody who has spent their life

1245
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:27,519
studying cannabis I bet you have an

1246
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:33,440
opinion which is do you think that the

1247
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:36,480
improved memory um was more related to

1248
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:40,119
um something the something that CBG was

1249
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:44,000
doing to actually improve memory

1250
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:46,960
function or do you think it was because

1251
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,798
um memory was increased in the absence

1252
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:53,400
of the anxiety which the CBG had solved

1253
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:56,038
for right well it's likely the latter uh

1254
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,599
that the reduction in anxiety and a test

1255
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:02,880
situation led to better performance

1256
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:05,519
however that might not only be it um

1257
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,838
there could be Memory enhancing

1258
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:11,199
properties and that is going to have to

1259
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:14,400
be teased out in subsequent studies so

1260
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:16,879
there's plenty more to do um I did want

1261
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:20,358
to indicate that there was one final

1262
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:24,200
thing that we tested that was again very

1263
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:29,119
important and that was the question of

1264
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:33,519
impairment of any type type um and um in

1265
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,519
fact again um

1266
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:41,159
CBG showed um lack of impairment uh

1267
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:45,880
participants performed significantly

1268
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:49,879
better um and the trial times two and

1269
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,960
three after um taking CBG than they did

1270
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:55,519
on

1271
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:58,880
Placebo um so uh again uh something that

1272
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:01,079
may not really have been expected but

1273
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:06,240
what I like to say is what the world

1274
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:09,480
needs now is an effective drug for

1275
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:12,719
anxiety that doesn't produce impairment

1276
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:15,240
or sedation or addiction and we may have

1277
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:17,639
it in the form of

1278
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:19,519
canaberal Amen now there's a big

1279
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:23,719
statement that I can get behind my

1280
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:25,400
goodness all right so um uh unless you

1281
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:27,199
have anything else to add regarding the

1282
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,599
conclusion I of the study I'm about to

1283
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:31,759
go to break and we'll after after the

1284
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,240
set break we will we will talk about

1285
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,720
ramifications and next steps but do you

1286
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,519
have anything else regarding the

1287
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:40,318
conclusions of the study that you want

1288
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:42,679
to uh tuck in here before we move on

1289
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:44,639
well I could summarize now or after the

1290
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:46,519
break all right well since you're going

1291
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:47,920
to summarize let's summarize uh after

1292
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:50,159
the break because we'll be summarizing a

1293
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,880
couple different points so um you are

1294
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,019
listening to shaping fire and my guest

1295
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:57,680
today is neurologist Dr Ethan Russo

1296
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:58,920
[Music]

1297
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:00,719
one of the challenges with buying

1298
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,760
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1299
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:05,399
have as many different fenos as you will

1300
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:08,240
have seeds in a pack that can be fun

1301
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,480
sure but so many varieties in one pack

1302
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:13,358
is a sign of an immature seedline that

1303
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,039
hasn't been worked enough I prefer my

1304
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:17,078
autof flowers to be worked enough that

1305
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,039
each pheno in the pack really captures

1306
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:21,920
the aspects that the breeder was

1307
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,680
intending this is why I recommend gnome

1308
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,480
automatics to my friends and listeners

1309
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:26,798
who grow automatic flowering cannabis

1310
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,639
seeds

1311
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:30,440
gnome automatic seeds are not just

1312
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:32,960
crossed and released they are

1313
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,358
painstakingly sifted again and again

1314
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,519
tested in a wide range of conditions and

1315
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:40,480
taken to a level of maturity that each

1316
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:42,599
plant will be recognizable by its traits

1317
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,480
traits that were hard earned so that you

1318
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:47,960

hours of daylight instead of the typical

1381
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,760
14 1/2 hours of daylight that means in

1382
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:24,318
most regions your plants will start to

1383
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,240
flower outdoors in the middle of July

Los and my guest today is neurologist Dr

1418
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:59,598
Ethan Russo so here we are in the big

1419
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:01,919
third set wrapping things up and you

1420
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,519
know Ethan the throughout our

1421
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:08,079
conversation the thing that really send

1422
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:12,119
tends to Glow big in this study is that

1423
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:14,760
78% of the participants said that CBG

1424
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:17,798
works better than their pharmaceutical

1425
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:21,000
or other traditional medication and that

1426
01:08:17,798 --> 01:08:24,000
is a staggeringly successful number in

1427
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,439
my eyes that nearly 80% of people said

1428
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,319
that CBG was better than whatever they

1429
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:31,519
normally use does this stand out to you

1430
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:33,000
as a research scientist too being like

1431
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,759
an oh my God

1432
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,920
moment uh yeah it was a surprise to me

1433
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:40,479
that it was that high but

1434
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:44,079
um

1435
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:47,759
perhaps in retrospect with uh 3 years

1436
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:51,039
since then it's less of a surprise to me

1437
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:53,479
because in our formulation work we've

1438
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:56,798
been using CBG

1439
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:58,798
extensively and uh the results bear this

1440
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:03,399
out it is an

1441
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:05,920
extremely versatile medicine that uh

1442
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:07,318
really contributes greatly to

1443
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,119
therapeutic

1444
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:11,480
effects and it just feeds into your uh

1445
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:14,679
your statement right before we went to

1446
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:17,198
commercial about how how big the impact

1447
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:19,319
of this can be in you know reducing

1448
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,439
human suffering from anxiety I mean it's

1449
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:23,279
a big deal even even though you and I

1450
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:27,960
are becoming increasingly comfortable

1451
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:29,600
with it right yes yeah so um one of the

1452
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,520
attributes or one of the aspects that I

1453
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:37,319
think is worthy of looking at is that so

1454
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:42,759
many people presently use CBD and or THC

1455
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:46,000
for their anxiety now and and CBD CBG

1456
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:49,000
and THC have all three of them got

1457
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,238
different um modes of

1458
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,560
operation um approaching um anxiety as

1459
01:09:53,238 --> 01:09:57,479
you mentioned in the last set one of the

1460
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,120
magical things that not magical one of

1461
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:03,039
the impressive things that CBG does is

1462
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:05,960
decrease anxiety without intoxication

1463
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:09,479
which as most of us know is is exactly

1464
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:11,679
the mode of operation for why THC works

1465
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:14,000
it sedates people and for many people

1466
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:16,760
that handles you know their major type

1467
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,158
of anxiety and it decreases so would you

1468
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:25,719
please do us the favor of comparing CBG

1469
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:29,158
versus THC for anxiety and then CBG G

1470
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:31,399
versus CBD so we can tease out a little

1471
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:33,079
bit more what is unique about CBG

1472
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:36,039
compared to these two which are very

1473
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:38,679
common commonly used in the Cannabis

1474
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:42,119
World sure

1475
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:45,480
so THC is a very strange one in this

1476
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:49,880
regard it's it's well known that uh it

1477
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:52,319
THC can be helpful or hurt anxiety and

1478
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:55,760
it's really a matter of dose so very

1479
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:58,599
very small doses have an anti- anxiet

1480
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:02,480
effect whereas higher doses can

1481
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:04,679
certainly induce anxiety or even Panic

1482
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:08,079
um and this is an effect that's been

1483
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:11,319
known for 4,000 years because it was in

1484
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:13,600
the ancient Assyrian literature on

1485
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:18,079
relation to cannabis it was said to be

1486
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:21,440
for or against panic and again a matter

1487
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:23,079
of dose is is that the biphasic nature

1488
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:27,039
is that the is that the vocabulary it's

1489
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:31,238
called a basic dose response with THC

1490
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:35,359
now if CBG induces anxiety I don't know

1491
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:37,678
what the dose is um we know anecdotally

1492
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:42,319
that people have taken very high doses

1493
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:45,800
and not um had this problem

1494
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:47,359
um so I don't know what the upper limit

1495
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:52,560
is

1496
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:56,198
um in this instance CBG probably is a

1497
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:59,840
safer bet if the target is an xiety

1498
01:11:56,198 --> 01:12:03,198
because um we know that there's a dose

1499
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:06,639
range that seems to be effective and uh

1500
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:11,839
without the intoxication that can occur

1501
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:15,520
if the te dose gets too high um uh you

1502
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:18,199
know so how about the two together well

1503
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:23,040
again um in our formulation work we're

1504
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:25,599
using CBG with uh low doses of THC and

1505
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,719
uh seemingly it's a really use full

1506
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,880
adjunct thing to add that improves

1507
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:35,000
clinical

1508
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:37,600
response um so there seem to be these at

1509
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:43,000
least additive or even synergistic

1510
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:46,159
benefits on pain sleep and mood um and

1511
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,279
having CBG aboard may increase What's

1512
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:51,799
called the therapeutic index of THC

1513
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:54,800
meaning the amount that you can use

1514
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:59,199
without producing side effects uh and

1515
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:02,840
making the overall effect that much

1516
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:07,119
greater so the idea is that adding CBG

1517
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:09,960
tier THC May relay may relieve some of

1518
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:12,840
the negative outcomes of THC and

1519
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:16,840
therefore helping THC do its job while

1520
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:19,719
CBG is doing its job quite right and

1521
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:22,440
we're we're seeing this where we have

1522
01:13:19,719 --> 01:13:25,158
situations of people rating their

1523
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:28,000
effects of different kavars and we know

1524
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:30,719
know what the certificates of analysis

1525
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,560
tell us about the proportions of the

1526
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:36,439
different components it's it's easy to

1527
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:39,280
see these patterns uh one of the things

1528
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:42,519
we're hearing consistently is when

1529
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:44,880
there's a significant amount of CBG in

1530
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,560
the preparation along with the THC that

1531
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:51,239
it's much better

1532
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:54,600
tolerated um that people have a good

1533
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:57,718
experience or benefit on symptoms

1534
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,920
without THC Associated side

1535
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:01,880
effects we've seen some of that

1536
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:05,359
anecdotally as well here on Vashon

1537
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:07,400
Island because um since the the CBG

1538
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:11,479
dominant cultivar has been grown here on

1539
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:14,759
the island for a few years um people who

1540
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:18,198
historically had a strong anxious

1541
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:20,920
reaction U dysphoric response to smoking

1542
01:14:18,198 --> 01:14:22,839
cannabis um even if they used you know

1543
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,800
Edibles or Oils or things like that some

1544
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,600
folks you know they just smoking doesn't

1545
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,679
work for them because it it shoots them

1546
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:32,360
up really fast and and some some folks

1547
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:36,279
don't like that people started um uh

1548
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:40,719
mixing CBG flour um in with their THC

1549
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:43,479
flour and and and a lot of those um you

1550
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:46,520
know sharp increases in anxiety were

1551
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:48,919
relieved and you know that those are

1552
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:52,320
those are very small number of people

1553
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:57,359
but again shows the potential for use

1554
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:58,880
for folks who are also needing THC for

1555
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:04,079
some other issue that they're dealing

1556
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:06,480
with but CBG can take the the edge off

1557
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:09,600
definitely do you have do you have

1558
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:13,759
compar similar comparisons of CBG versus

1559
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,760
CBD used for anxiety okay so let's look

1560
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,760
at why people use them we we've

1561
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:23,840
mentioned that uh the survey patients uh

1562
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:26,800
use CBG to treat pain anxiety and Aid

1563
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:31,159
sleep we we often hear the same claims

1564
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:33,679
for CBD but we have to purse this out if

1565
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:36,119
we're talking about

1566
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:39,840
CBD as an

1567
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:42,319
isolate it actually is alerting at low

1568
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,719
and moderate doses it's only at extreme

1569
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:48,960
doses again this basic dose response

1570
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:52,000
that CBD actually

1571
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:55,800
um produces any kind of

1572
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,359
sedation um with respect to anxiety

1573
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,960
we know now after these studies that

1574
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:05,439
there's a distinct

1575
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:09,679
difference CBD was studied in this um an

1576
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:13,079
article by buram masi at all in Brazil

1577
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:15,800
some years ago they looked at Social

1578
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:20,439
Anxiety which is akin to what we were

1579
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:25,119
doing here it required 400 milligrams of

1580
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:26,439
CBD isolate to produce a significant

1581
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:29,639
anti-anxiety

1582
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:32,399
effect we got the anti-anxiety effect

1583
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:33,800
with 20 milligrams so that's a 20 fold

1584
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:38,719
difference in

1585
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:42,199
dose uh meaning that it appears that CBG

1586
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:45,840
is much more potent as an anti-anxiety

1587
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:48,519
agent 400 mgram of CBD is going to be

1588
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:52,159
quite expensive no matter what kind of

1589
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:53,120
preparation whereas hopefully with a CBG

1590
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:56,599
only

1591
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:59,439
kovar um 20 milligrams is is just not

1592
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:03,800
that much uh should should be much more

1593
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:07,000
economical and I suspect more effective

1594
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:10,639
overall uh do we know enough about the

1595
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,840
mode of operation of CBD versus CBG to

1596
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:17,039
know what they may be doing differently

1597
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,159
certainly based on the the size of dose

1598
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:23,238
um it it suggests we should move in

1599
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:25,799
towards CBG but but having used both

1600
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:28,479
independently um for my anxiety I just

1601
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:31,000
simply find CBG to be wildly more

1602
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:32,959
effective than CBD which makes me think

1603
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,359
that it's doing something different than

1604
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:39,198
the CBD uh quite likely and again some

1605
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:41,559
of this gets into some really he heavy

1606
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:43,719
effects uh in different areas of the

1607
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:46,520
brain and and

1608
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:49,000
neurotransmitters um what I believe and

1609
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:53,159
we'll need to have subsequent studies

1610
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:57,760
like functional MRI or uh pet scans to

1611
01:17:53,158 --> 01:18:02,799
look at this but um this is likely

1612
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:06,520
affecting um uh the lyic system uh

1613
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:09,039
emotional areas of the brain um and yeah

1614
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:12,360
likely are a lot of distinct differences

1615
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:14,119
but um that's going to require more

1616
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:16,519
investigation yeah that sounds like a

1617
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:18,079
great shaping Fire episode too so uh

1618
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,480
soon as you've got that research done uh

1619
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:23,399
make sure you let me know

1620
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:24,919
e yeah it might be a while um another

1621
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:27,960
thing that I want to point out uh you

1622
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:32,199
just compared uh the 20 Mig of whole

1623
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:34,560
plant CBG dominant tincture to 400 Mig

1624
01:18:32,198 --> 01:18:36,479
of CBD isolate and we've already talked

1625
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,239
a little bit uh on other times that we

1626
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,119
have spoken about the difference between

1627
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:43,799
isolate and whole plant

1628
01:18:40,119 --> 01:18:47,319
preparations um one of the ideas that

1629
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:51,159
the paper puts forward is that

1630
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:54,238
um one way to tweak the study to look

1631
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:58,119
for uh additional benefits would be to

1632
01:18:54,238 --> 01:19:01,519
increase the dosage of the CBG from from

1633
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:04,198
the 20 Mig that was delivered up to 25

1634
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:07,080
to 50 mg because some of the other

1635
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:10,919
science that is being done at this time

1636
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:13,279
are is using isolate up to 50 milligrams

1637
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:16,960
but to me someone who's very much into

1638
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:19,319
whole plant medicine um the efficacy of

1639
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:22,600
isolate and whole resin aren't the same

1640
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:24,799
and time and time again we see um CBD

1641
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:28,159
isolate for example not showing the same

1642
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:32,960
efficacy as whole plant how do you weigh

1643
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:34,879
for yourself um you know 20 mg of whole

1644
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:38,319
plant tincture that was used in your

1645
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:41,319
study versus 25 to 50 milligrams of

1646
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:43,198
isolate being used in a different study

1647
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:46,198
it seems to me like those are it would

1648
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:49,479
be very hard to compare those because

1649
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:52,198
they're not apples and apples yeah it's

1650
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:55,279
a problem and this is why um certainly

1651
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:59,919
when I'm reviewing uh big acting as a

1652
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:02,800
peer reviewer on other studies I want

1653
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,960
specification on what's being utilized

1654
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:08,360
in other words we want to see studies

1655
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:11,880
where there actually is a certificate of

1656
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:15,679
analysis as we provideed here

1657
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:18,319
um in contrast where you've got studies

1658
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:21,840
where uh let's say you're looking at

1659
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:24,799
pain um and um there are a whole bunch

1660
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:27,440
of different preparations they might be

1661
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:31,520
THC predominant or they might be type

1662
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:34,198
tws with uh THC and CBD different doses

1663
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:38,400
different modes of administration it's

1664
01:20:34,198 --> 01:20:41,198
very hard to parse out what's doing what

1665
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:46,359
and you come up with generalities like

1666
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:50,519
cannabis helps with pain that's nice but

1667
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:54,639
um science really demands more

1668
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:56,960
specificity um and that's why I believe

1669
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,279
believe that studies of this type where

1670
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,439
we have a

1671
01:20:58,279 --> 01:21:03,119
defined uh

1672
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:06,279
preparation uh we can it's it's much

1673
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:09,559
easier to to make these claims

1674
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:11,319
particularly since we had so many

1675
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:14,159
significant

1676
01:21:11,319 --> 01:21:17,519
results I think that a lot of Citizen

1677
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:19,759
scientists and caregivers like myself we

1678
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:23,120
we find ourselves running into an issue

1679
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:25,440
where um the studies that are being done

1680
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:28,000
right now are being used are being done

1681
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:30,439
with isolate because isolate is just a

1682
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,679
single molecule of the

1683
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:38,000
cannabinoid and um it's very specific

1684
01:21:34,679 --> 01:21:40,600
and and and it's also those studies uh

1685
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,760
transition very easily to to

1686
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:47,520
pharmaceutical research um your research

1687
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:51,400
on the other hand I Harald because you

1688
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:54,800
have the audacity to use the plant um as

1689
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:56,960
it's grown and using a whole resin and

1690
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,800
it in ways that that actual patients

1691
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:04,319
actual humans have been using it for

1692
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:07,320
thousands of years um but I can see that

1693
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:10,039
since you choose to not use isolate you

1694
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:11,840
might get some push back from either

1695
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:15,079
people who want to use your work for

1696
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:18,560
pharmaceutical applications or folks who

1697
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:20,439
just think that a a plant resin is too

1698
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,039
wild if you will there's too many

1699
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:24,759
variables because there's cannabinoids

1700
01:22:22,039 --> 01:22:26,198
that don't even show up in the COA but

1701
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,159
but those of us who are into whole plant

1702
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:31,039
medicine we we still hold on that that's

1703
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:35,079
where the future of cannabis medicine is

1704
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:37,319
so you know as somebody you um who has

1705
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:39,800
been a long time uh proponent of the

1706
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:43,279
Entourage effect and whole plant

1707
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:45,920
medicine how do you see it personally as

1708
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:47,639
as why you choose to use whole plant

1709
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,199
medicine versus

1710
01:22:47,639 --> 01:22:52,800
isolate uh well the number one reason is

1711
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:55,759
I believe in the Synergy of the

1712
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,800
different components um however I've

1713
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:01,159
been on the other side of the fence too

1714
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:06,639
keep in mind uh the study we just did

1715
01:23:01,158 --> 01:23:09,439
with loning um isolate with THC isolate

1716
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:10,199
sometimes you require a deconstruction

1717
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:12,960
and

1718
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:16,359
reconstruction to understand what the

1719
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:19,480
differences are so I see a a place for

1720
01:23:16,359 --> 01:23:22,880
both in research when it comes to

1721
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:25,759
Therapeutics I'm firmly in the camp that

1722
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:28,400
you want an extract and not an

1723
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,560
isolate right on that sounds good for me

1724
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:32,158
and it seems to work best on uh on the

1725
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,520
things that we're trying to do with with

1726
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:38,519
real people so Ethan do you have any um

1727
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,960
other uh summary or or impact that you

1728
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:44,320
would like to share before we wrap up uh

1729
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:47,399
sure you know going back to the study uh

1730
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:51,279
that we did I'd like to run through some

1731
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:53,960
key points if May yes okay so this was

1732
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:57,359
the first study of canaba gereral

1733
01:23:53,960 --> 01:24:00,279
looking at anxiety in humans um so we're

1734
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:03,158
very pleased with that and it's often a

1735
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:06,840
Race Against Time to get these things

1736
01:24:03,158 --> 01:24:10,839
published before somebody else does it

1737
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,279
so um we're pleased with that um so

1738
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:16,880
canaural

1739
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:21,319
reduced anxiety and stress in this sort

1740
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:24,440
of manufactured setting um you had asked

1741
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:27,359
about the degree I have another figure

1742
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:31,879
that we can utilize here so there was an

1743
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:38,000
average decrease in .95 out of

1744
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:41,039
10 um uh that's a 26% reduction in the

1745
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,158
anxiety and stress scores that were

1746
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:47,198
already low to begin with um so you know

1747
01:24:45,158 --> 01:24:51,319
what does this mean to somebody who has

1748
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:55,079
a clinical anxiety disorder um we can't

1749
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:58,000
say from this but you know and I know

1750
01:24:55,079 --> 01:25:00,238
from people that have utilized CBG

1751
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,719
preparations that they're usually very

1752
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:05,279
pleased with the

1753
01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:08,520
results uh another Point uh in this

1754
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:11,279
study CBG actually enhanced verbal

1755
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:14,480
memory and it did that with no

1756
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:18,039
significant impairments either in memory

1757
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:20,238
or motor functioning that's psychomotor

1758
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:24,439
speed and balance that was what the

1759
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:28,158
Druid app looked at uh so the CBG Dr

1760
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:30,238
Druid score was lower and comparable to

1761
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:33,519
Placebo and

1762
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:35,599
Baseline um again we saw no evidence

1763
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:38,080
that CBG was

1764
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:41,679
intoxicating um the intoxication and

1765
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:45,880
drug effect ratings were under one on a

1766
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:49,880
10-point scale and Drug liking remain

1767
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:53,279
neutral throughout the study um and in

1768
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:57,440
terms of side effects negative drug

1769
01:25:53,279 --> 01:26:01,880
effect ratings like dry eyes rapid heart

1770
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:06,399
rate dry mouth uh those remain low and

1771
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:08,840
did not differ from Placebo uh so all of

1772
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:12,960
these really indicate that this seems to

1773
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:15,079
be have an extremely benign profile at

1774
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:18,319
the same time that it's producing

1775
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:21,319
significant effects on Stress and

1776
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:23,639
Anxiety well that's a great summary and

1777
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:25,799
you know on a on a real human level I

1778
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:27,960
can only imagine that you and Dr Cutler

1779
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,840
are pretty stoked with how this survey

1780
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:33,679
turned out or how the research turned

1781
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:36,480
out uh yes um we're definitely going on

1782
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:40,560
from here we have immediate plans for

1783
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:44,079
two more studies um one would be similar

1784
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:48,639
to this but done in the lab uh which

1785
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:50,679
allows for greater objective measures um

1786
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:54,480
you know measuring blood pressure

1787
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:56,920
measuring cortisol a stress hormone uh

1788
01:26:54,479 --> 01:27:00,000
measuring reactions to pain on a thing

1789
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:03,279
called the cold pressure test so that'll

1790
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:08,399
be up uh coming up and we also have

1791
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:10,359
plans for a clinical study uh where uh

1792
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:15,198
CBG

1793
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:19,000
preparation um would be looked at uh uh

1794
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:21,198
in terms of a a an actual

1795
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,800
disorder mean like a one like you'll

1796
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:27,158
Target one yes exactly I see good well

1797
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,560
Dr Russo thank you so much for uh being

1798
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:31,039
a guest today again on shaping fire I

1799
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:34,400
mean you've been on the show so many

1800
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:37,519
times over over the years now I think

1801
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:39,198
this is going to be 115 episode 115 and

1802
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,480
every time you do we learn we learn

1803
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:44,158
