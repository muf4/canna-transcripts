1
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,699
hey everybody I am here today with Tyler

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:16,868
Marquardt who's a good friend of mine

3
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:18,910
he's a longtime cannabis cultivator and

4
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:20,739
hash maker but today we're going to talk

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,268
about something totally different

6
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:25,059
Tyler I have been friends for a long

7
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:31,468
time and he has recently completed a

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:36,159
series of sessions of ketamine under

9
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:38,350
doctors care I guess so it's like legal

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,898
official ketamine instead of ketamine

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,228
you got from a friend so um so we wanted

12
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:46,719
to talk about that a little bit because

13
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:50,079
ketamine therapy to my knowledge is

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,579
pretty new and to come across somebody

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:58,058
who has has done a full round of it and

16
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,530
is also you know has got a recreational

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,408
drug background so let's share some of

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,639
our vocabulary right I thought that

19
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:05,950
would be really interesting to hear

20
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:08,170
about it from somebody who's already a

21
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,909
psycho not so Tyler thank you so much

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,109
for taking some time this morning and

23
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,570
chatting with us absolutely thank you

24
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:15,789
for having me here around so so let's

25
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:17,709
let's figure out you know I know that

26
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,260
you were aware of ketamine at all of us

27
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:21,939
who have done like exploration with

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,590
drugs you know generally know that

29
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,109
ketamine exists because it's a horse

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:30,159
tranquilizer and and people joke about K

31
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:33,430
holes and stuff but um but but at some

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,560
point you were reintroduced to it as a

33
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,560
medicine something that you thought was

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,200
going to help offer you some kind of

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,019
relief so when you lay that out for us

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,939
and kind of like let us know what what

37
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:47,649
attracted you to it like let alone

38
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,439
getting doctors help and getting

39
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,050
ketamine yeah so I was born with the

40
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,450
genetic liver disorder and IBS and that

41
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,849
had caused serious depression and

42
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,290
anxiety

43
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:02,699
specifically with food so every time you

44
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,750
eat food it causes intestinal spasms and

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,540
other issues that are very detrimental

46
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,030
and hard to deal with so you have to

47
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,489
become forcing yourself to basically eat

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,400
food and that you get anxiety every time

49
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,460
you eat so over the last 38 years of

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,490
dealing with this it just

51
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,980
built and built and built and got worse

52
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:24,950
then I had gotten arrested in 2011 and

53
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,409
convicted for a court trial for running

54
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:29,000
a medical marijuana dispensary and that

55
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:31,669
just kind of added to everything so the

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,129
depression hit really really hard and

57
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,899
then I needed something to kind of help

58
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:38,180
with that because regular psychotherapy

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,800
wasn't working anything it exercised

60
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,879
wasn't doing it and I needed something

61
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,500
to really push myself beyond the level

62
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,430
of what society was giving me with basic

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,259
sacrifice stuff that we'd normally go

64
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,640
through you know so you know you knew

65
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:54,349
you knew you were depressed and you

66
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,809
wanted things to change and you tried

67
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,569
you tried therapy and clearly you tried

68
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,789
weed and exercise and you're like you're

69
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:04,699
going down the list you're like none of

70
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:07,549
this stuff is working yeah and so so

71
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:10,429
like you know ketamine is kind of a a

72
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,770
typical response to depression right

73
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,020
right so so what what turned you onto

74
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,310
that as being a solution so you know

75
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,980
being on Instagram in a couple other

76
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,599
places social media sites I had good

77
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,429
connections with other Psychonauts and

78
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,409
and and doctors and and started doing

79
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,120
research about what options that were

80
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,280
out there a friend of ours Allison

81
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,890
Drayson who works at the clinic that I

82
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,020
went to she had posted something about

83
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,029
the therapy being available so that kind

84
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,490
of sparked my interest I had tried

85
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,890
ketamine like once before as a teenager

86
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,570
and did not enjoy the experience was not

87
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,909
ready for it or whatever the deal was

88
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:46,009
and and so I never really thought about

89
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:48,139
it or anything like that and then

90
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:50,179
started doing more research into there's

91
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,129
a book called the ketamine Papers which

92
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,569
kind of lays out a bunch of different

93
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,090
experiments that were done over the

94
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,680
years so I read that a little bit and

95
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,259
just became a little bit more interested

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,150
and it really got to the point where the

97
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:04,459
depression was so heavy oh I was

98
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,840
suicidal and like it's really struggling

99
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,200
to deal with moving forward in life

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,909
because of the stomach issues and other

101
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,159
stuff that was related to it

102
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:15,289
so I end up just being like you know

103
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,500
what like I'm just gonna give this a try

104
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:19,608
and if it works great if it doesn't then

105
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,699
I get to you know how

106
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:25,068
a second second somatic experience in

107
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,919
you know for a couple hours or something

108
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:30,770
like that and but it did it really

109
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:34,339
changed my life after the sessions were

110
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:38,209
done so when you originally read about

111
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:41,959
ketamine as a potentially providing

112
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:43,370
relief for depression how was it

113
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,218
described to you that got your attention

114
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,139
you're like oh this is this is something

115
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:49,639
I had not considered before like what

116
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,710
was the kind of means supposed to do it

117
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,650
was it was interesting because some of

118
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:56,899
the papers had said like um there was a

119
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:58,878
female individual patient who was

120
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:00,378
struggling with depression anxiety and

121
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,840
she had taken one treatment and was

122
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:04,490
cured from her issues after one

123
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,138
treatment and I was like wow that's

124
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,210
amazing and now of course the paper said

125
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,098
no this is not not all patients are like

126
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:12,888
this other patients do require other

127
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:14,269
lengthier treatments some patients don't

128
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:16,009
respond to the treatment so it's like

129
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:17,810
any other pharmaceutical it's like

130
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,038
cannabis you know one may work for

131
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,439
somebody and it may not work well for

132
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,908
others but for the people that does work

133
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,088
well and it seems like it works well for

134
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:27,800
majority of the people it doesn't make a

135
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:29,689
major change so I was very much

136
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,968
interested in like it's either gonna

137
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:33,769
change or I'm gonna kill myself so

138
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:36,379
that's pretty much where it came down to

139
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:38,180
I was homeless living in my car and like

140
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,189
you know just trying to figure out what

141
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,168
where my next step was because the

142
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:44,418
biggest issue with the digestive tract

143
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:46,278
issue is like I have to spend a majority

144
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:48,468
of my money on food and not just

145
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:50,569
McDonald's or like fast foods or

146
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:53,180
anything like has to be good food that

147
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:55,278
has nutritious value so that was like a

148
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,930
majority of the issue of where I was

149
00:05:55,278 --> 00:06:00,259
headed it was like I need either change

150
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,418
now or we end this and so I figured hey

151
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:05,028
let's give this one one last chance and

152
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:09,378
see where it goes I had tried micro

153
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:11,778
dosing psilocybin but struggled with the

154
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:13,129
digestive tract issues of it so it

155
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:15,408
wasn't something that really worked well

156
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:17,330
for me on a day-to-day basis and this

157
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:20,180
seemed like it was you go in for the

158
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:22,818
session the session is over and then you

159
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,370
go back to life and it's maybe a slow

160
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:27,319
gradual build back up but it'll get you

161
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,360
where you need to be and so that became

162
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,490
very interesting

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,949
and like I said it was more just like it

164
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,379
we give this a try or we end it and

165
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,598
that's it and so I tried committing

166
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,189
suicide a couple times because of the

167
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:42,218
digestive tract issues once as a

168
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:44,139
teenager and then once in my 20s and and

169
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:45,550
so I was like you know this is I'm just

170
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,870
getting tired of this it's tired of

171
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,210
waking up every morning and painting

172
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,129
tired of like having to like relieve

173
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,258
myself from in a situation to go to the

174
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,780
bathroom or do something like that

175
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,460
and it just became mentally exhausting

176
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:59,739
and physically exhausting as well so

177
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,318
something had to happen either I get

178
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,240
better or I go away right now and so so

179
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,919
so let's talk about what it's like

180
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,439
because you know very likely there are

181
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,668
other people who are listening who are

182
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:14,800
depressed or have one of the other

183
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:17,529
attributes that that ketamine can be

184
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,329
used for and they're all like but what a

185
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:22,318
weird visit that's got to be going into

186
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:25,060
an office asking for you know

187
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:29,408
potentially hallucinogenic doses of

188
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,810
ketamine yes that's so um so you know I

189
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:34,329
know that you went to doctors to neo

190
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,418
agar walls clinic who has been on the

191
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:39,278
shaping fire podcast and you know we've

192
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:41,560
had speak many times because Sunil is

193
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:43,389
great right and and you were you were

194
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,088
kind of encouraged to come in by our

195
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,949
mutual friend Allison Grayson so you

196
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:50,978
already kind of knew the people involved

197
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:52,598
with the clinic yeah but um will you you

198
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:55,449
you know remind us of the name of the

199
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:57,610
clinic where it is and and essentially

200
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,860
like what your first experience was

201
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:03,189
going in there yes so the Ames Institute

202
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,509
is located in Seattle on East Lake and

203
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:09,550
it's a easily accessible place to get to

204
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:12,669
and the people who work there are all

205
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,770
wonderful people going into that office

206
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:17,769
really makes you feel like you have the

207
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:19,718
potential to change your life everybody

208
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:22,959
is super carrying everybody is super

209
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:25,449
calm there's a wonderful ambiance in the

210
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,638
office so it's very inviting when you go

211
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,620
in there it's not a cold sterile

212
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,569
doctor's office kind of feel which was

213
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,698
very something that I was pretty much

214
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,360
always against like I don't want to have

215
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:37,370
to take Western medicine

216
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,019
- like you know deal with it because it

217
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,519
usually causes other problems or

218
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,990
something of that nature right and

219
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,918
looking at their website you can tell

220
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,110
that this is gonna be a different

221
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,519
experience right because they I don't

222
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,950
remember it exactly but it says

223
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,320
something like you know ketamine therapy

224
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,028
cannabis therapy psychedelics therapy in

225
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,709
you're like oh I like this menu yeah

226
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:57,019
it's not exactly like popping in your

227
00:08:54,708 --> 00:09:01,039
regular doctor's office yeah totally so

228
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:03,110
so so was you know did you go in and

229
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,389
have a ketamine experience your first

230
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,680
time or was there like intake first yeah

231
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,819
so there's gonna take they kind of get

232
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,289
you to prepare it and they want to go

233
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,510
through to see like kind of what your

234
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:14,120
experiences are with psychedelic

235
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,528
experiences so that they know okay are

236
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,000
you prepared for what's gonna happen

237
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:18,740
have you ever had something like this

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,450
before because if you've never had that

239
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,310
experience before and this is your first

240
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,100
time in that setting it could be very

241
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:26,359
very overwhelming and because you're not

242
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,769
in a comfortable setting that you know

243
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,899
you're not in your house or something

244
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,000
like that so it can be overwhelming if

245
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,639
you are custom to these kind of

246
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,549
experiences psychedelic experiences you

247
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,528
will definitely have an easier walking

248
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:41,389
into the office so understanding of

249
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:45,698
what's happening sure and then the

250
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:48,559
actual ketamine sessions themselves are

251
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:51,109
are taking place in such a way that you

252
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,208
you feel extremely comfortable they make

253
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,889
you feel very they offer the opportunity

254
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:57,889
for comfort there and in a variety of

255
00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:00,169
different ways most of the sessions take

256
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,610
place in like a reclining chair where

257
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:03,259
they'll put like a weighted blanket on

258
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,180
you keep you warm

259
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:06,980
they'll also run aromatherapy in the

260
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:09,739
office as well so you have very warming

261
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,889
kind of smells when you come in and then

262
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:17,448
they also introduce music which is kind

263
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:19,278
of like a instrumental Eastern style of

264
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:21,500
music that's very calming and relaxing

265
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:25,820
and helps you get into that kind of

266
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:30,259
transient state that added with Brooks

267
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:33,440
here it is they offer these blindfolds

268
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:36,980
which was developed by Alex gray who is

269
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,449
an artist and I'll Psychonauts I go now

270
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,269
probably these the most well-known

271
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:42,149
psychic

272
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,319
some of the group here but these are

273
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,659
very interesting in the fact that

274
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,709
they're raised and the insides are cut

275
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:51,389
out so it allows you to open your eyes

276
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,989
while the black out action is still

277
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,929
happening

278
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,330
so it'll increase the effect the visual

279
00:10:54,929 --> 00:11:03,349
effects of the ketamine which is a very

280
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:06,120
important part of the experience and so

281
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,300
so what one thing I want to toss in here

282
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,399
just a shift the pronouns you're using

283
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,500
at this point because since you're

284
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,690
moving into telling us what your

285
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,100
ketamine experience was like for you I

286
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,410
want to be clear that this is not a

287
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,300
commercial for the clinic or anything

288
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,909
the reason why we're talking about this

289
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:27,088
is that I wanted us to be able to hear

290
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:30,208
Tyler's experienced first person so that

291
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:34,350
any of us who also want to get involved

292
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:37,139
can find this kind of care wherever so

293
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,200
so at this point let's shift it from

294
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:43,799
what the Ames Institute did for you to

295
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,079
versus like I and so like what what was

296
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,969
going on for you because I think that

297
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,449
you'll know your story will be told in a

298
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:56,370
different way yes so so on the day that

299
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:58,560
you first went for an in-office ketamine

300
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,000
experience which so did you know it was

301
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,828
going to be wholly synergetic before you

302
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,289
started I had a feeling that it would

303
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:07,559
probably be something like that I didn't

304
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:11,669
realize how intense it would be so that

305
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:13,049
was interesting to me and I mean I've

306
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:15,419
done a fair amount of hallucinogens

307
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,919
before so I knew the experience but but

308
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:18,179
when you first told me about it that you

309
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,120
were getting gonna get involved with

310
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:23,849
this almost a year ago I was thinking

311
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,799
like a whole like paralysis right like

312
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,540
you like you were just gonna be in your

313
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,370
head and kind of frozen and that was

314
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,899
going to be it and then when you first

315
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,299
described this story that you're about

316
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,210
to tell us I'm all like what the hell

317
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:38,479
you do

318
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,310
yeah yeah so so so you thought that you

319
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,240
might loose Nate but but most of you

320
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:46,699
just wanted to check out this this new

321
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,299
yeah yeah seems true yeah that you know

322
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,070
or allowed access for it so yeah so the

323
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:53,599
experience I sat down into this

324
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,820
reclining chair that they provided for

325
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,920
me and put the blankets on everything

326
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,860
it's an inner muscular injection so I

327
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,679
got the injection into my shoulder now I

328
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:07,129
am a slightly different wired than most

329
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,659
people most people generally are kind of

330
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,980
in an anesthetic state and they just lay

331
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:12,589
there for the hour and a half time

332
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,710
period and kind of just soak in the

333
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,930
experience apparently I am a very wild

334
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,820
child and was like flailing everywhere

335
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:22,459
and I almost fell out of the chair

336
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,350
during the experience so on to the

337
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,810
second experience they moved me to the

338
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,430
floor on a mattress where Serena was

339
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:30,619
like you didn't have as far that's all

340
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:31,819
the safer I think for everybody here cuz

341
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,009
I almost punch the nurse in the face

342
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,320
apparently at one point came over to the

343
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:38,389
help and I was like rah so you're

344
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,910
flailing right if most people get really

345
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:43,580
sedated right up and they just lay there

346
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:46,730
and they have this mental experience

347
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,230
that is healing while they are in this

348
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,659
sedated state

349
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,580
why were you flailing around were you

350
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:54,799
having like active hallucinations that

351
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,290
you were responding to or were you just

352
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,169
like feeling you know like oh I've got

353
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:02,000
ants in my bloodstream or whatever yeah

354
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:04,309
what was the nature of your flailing I

355
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,450
guess so the way it worked was when they

356
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:07,399
give you the injection I got the

357
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,980
injection right into the arm and they

358
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,559
put it in and it's within maybe 15

359
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,570
seconds you'll immediately you start

360
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,449
feeling warm in your arm and then you

361
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,040
smell the ketamine which is interesting

362
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,170
and then within 15 seconds you start

363
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,699
drifting off slowly into another

364
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:25,639
dimension so that's pretty nice like

365
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,350
it's not a rocket shot into like another

366
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,139
dimension but it is an out-of-body

367
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,269
experience so you do leave your your

368
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,069
person and go somewhere else in your mom

369
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:36,379
finally dimethyltryptamine like DMT

370
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,600
exactly it's very much like DMT in that

371
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:40,860
sense except for with DMT you seem just

372
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,750
all of a sudden being rock it is that

373
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,669
yeah and this isn't much more like your

374
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,649
honor like maybe like a magic carpet or

375
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:49,740
a cloud and being brought up to like an

376
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:51,240
escalator to like the next dimension so

377
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,190
the softness of it is really nice for

378
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,060
somebody who maybe isn't excuse to that

379
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:59,220
kind of DMT like jet fuel experience but

380
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:02,159
you know when you get there it is a very

381
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,410
DMT like experience where there's a lot

382
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,789
of moving shapes and colors a lot of

383
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:11,610
sound of grinding and stuff like that a

384
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:13,949
very intense overwhelming a lot of the

385
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,899
issues I think I had with the flailing

386
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,900
and the and stuff like that is because

387
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,549
of my liver and I processed drugs very

388
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,309
differently than other people because of

389
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:26,069
that liver enzyme disorder so you know

390
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:28,739
like if you were to take the ketamine it

391
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:33,120
may give you an experience that's like

392
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:35,310
longer and and more stable whereas I get

393
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,429
a very hard intense experience for a

394
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:40,019
shorter duration and so because my liver

395
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:41,549
is just like you know let's take

396
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,590
everything in and like this seems great

397
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:45,479
you know and so that seems to be a bit

398
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,710
of an issue so they have to adjust some

399
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,240
of the things for the second treatment

400
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,620
for that as well too because like put

401
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,990
you on the floor first treatment was a

402
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,340
lot it was pretty heavy and so but again

403
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,830
everybody's different so they try to

404
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:59,940
figure out where you are to gauge it at

405
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:02,759
and but I think the heaviness of the

406
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,930
trip is the most important part because

407
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:10,259
it really resets your brain and it

408
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:13,319
really resets you to becoming accepting

409
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:15,240
of problems as opposed to being like

410
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,280
there's nothing we can do this problem

411
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,110
is gonna ruin me but a little wah you

412
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,269
end up becoming more like this is a

413
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,480
problem now how do we solve it kind of

414
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:28,439
issue and so after the first treatment I

415
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:32,519
felt slightly better less depressed not

416
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,670
a hundred percent pulled off but I felt

417
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,769
like I had shifted the paradigm to be

418
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:40,649
facing somewhere else even though you

419
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:45,269
were flailing would you would you call

420
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:46,649
it fun I would call it fun uh if some

421
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:49,419
people may call it a terrifying

422
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:52,840
experience I think it depends on how you

423
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:56,379
like to view life I enjoy psychedelics I

424
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,450
have always enjoyed psychedelics it's

425
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:01,210
probably one of my preferred drugs of

426
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:05,080
choice obviously cannabis being a

427
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:06,370
hallucinogen and so I think for me it

428
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,659
was a more comfortable experience

429
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,699
because that was something I was used to

430
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,529
it but it could could be slightly

431
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,480
terrifying for somebody who's not used

432
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:16,000
to that kind of psychedelic experience

433
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,309
but again one of those things is it's

434
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,069
terrifying because it's changing you

435
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,960
internally from what the nurse told me

436
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,519
was there's a ring in your head now

437
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,690
obviously not doctor I'm not gonna

438
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,690
probably pronounce this or do this

439
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:31,120
correctly but there's a ring of cellular

440
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,610
structures in your head that basically

441
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,139
ketamine rewires and that has to do with

442
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:36,969
like depression and anxiety and

443
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,800
associates with that and it literally

444
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:42,549
rewires the connections and those

445
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,399
portions of the brain and so that may

446
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:47,440
happen slowly over a multiple period of

447
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,050
time for me it took a few months for

448
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,660
that to work but you can feel the change

449
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:56,669
happening and it's interesting you can

450
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,670
you come out of the experience very

451
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:01,719
confused at first like to come down is a

452
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,190
little bit confusing but you work

453
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,490
yourself out of that after about 30

454
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,630
minutes and you do need somebody to pick

455
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,190
you up afterwards because you're not

456
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,440
able to like drive or do anything like

457
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,930
that well that reminds me a lot going

458
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,220
back to DMT right because folks who have

459
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:20,890
not tried something like DMT it's not

460
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,960
like like psilocybin or something where

461
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:28,780
where you take something and you're my

462
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,019
first person consciousness analogy is

463
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:33,759
still here but I am but there's there's

464
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,710
something on top of that right that

465
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,119
there's the hallucinogen on top of it

466
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,009
but you're still like essentially

467
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:43,059
walking around being you yeah right

468
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:46,960
whereas drugs like DMT and ketamine it's

469
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:48,279
more like you take your human you unplug

470
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,110
from reality

471
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:53,308
your first-person consciousness is gone

472
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:55,859
and you plug into another real

473
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:57,750
which is totally foreign and yet somehow

474
00:18:55,859 --> 00:19:00,659
familiar and you're there for a while

475
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,220
and then it ends and then you unplug

476
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,650
from that reality and suddenly now

477
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,589
you're back in your body that is a

478
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,600
really strange experience not only every

479
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:11,759
time that you experience it but it was

480
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:16,798
certainly the first couple times yes and

481
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:19,079
um you're wiped out just from having

482
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,210
such an intensity experience like like

483
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,859
you aren't ready to nap for days sure

484
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,919
yeah afterwards the stuff for about six

485
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:27,839
hours after each session and you kind of

486
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,950
are after the six hour rest you're

487
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,389
better you're you're back on your feet

488
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,580
again and there's no issues or anything

489
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,049
like that but you're right it can be

490
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,899
overwhelming for some folks who are new

491
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:38,940
to the experience but you know I think

492
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,559
it's a it's a crucial point part of the

493
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,970
experience like without that part I

494
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,490
think it you wouldn't be able to move

495
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:47,669
forward so one thing I want to dive in a

496
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,919
little bit more is during the experience

497
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,809
while you are let's say checked out

498
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,960
right you are not having your first

499
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:57,599
person Tyler consciousness and yet you

500
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,269
have memories of what was happening

501
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,918
during your ketamine trip so so some

502
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:06,418
part of your brain is certainly running

503
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:10,049
and really busy right that may sound

504
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:12,059
like spooky to some people right yes and

505
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:13,918
and honestly maybe even that's

506
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:18,000
legitimate yeah that's some pretty

507
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,400
intense stuff that happens so but will

508
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,660
you talk a little bit more about what

509
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,980
that was like

510
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,779
like you're not conscious but but things

511
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,808
are happening in your mind you just talk

512
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,119
to that weirdness absolutely the the

513
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:34,918
mask really kind of enhances everything

514
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,989
when you wear the the the face mask

515
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,520
because at one point I accidentally

516
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,808
knocked the face mask off and then you

517
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,279
can see everybody in the room and you

518
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:43,200
see them as miss starlett it was

519
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,149
horrible actually because like the

520
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,470
individuals don't look like they should

521
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,690
look like they're you're hallucinating

522
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,130
like characters on them or they're

523
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,420
or something like that so it's a little

524
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,490
bit overwhelming you have to get the

525
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,230
mass spec on pretty quickly but when the

526
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,120
mask is on it's it's it's different

527
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:01,470
you're in this environment where it's

528
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:04,439
almost like the the environment around

529
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:07,440
you that you see is shifting like a

530
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,019
kaleidoscope it's a bunch of colors and

531
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,600
shapes colors and shapes are coming out

532
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,980
of the dimension that you're seeing and

533
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,469
they're moving and shifting almost like

534
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:20,190
a Rubik's Cube what would kind of so you

535
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:22,019
may see like a square color four or five

536
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,789
colors come out in a square shape and

537
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,829
then shift into a circle and then move

538
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:29,099
back into the the background of what

539
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:32,309
you're seeing some people experience and

540
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:34,529
like an entity or like a person or a

541
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:37,649
face I didn't have any experiences like

542
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:40,680
that this is essentially your your brain

543
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:44,130
just freestyling yeah like even though

544
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,560
there are themes to it like the you know

545
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,080
like gyrating geometrics and things like

546
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,389
that yeah um I would think that it's

547
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:53,309
pretty personal yeah and there are

548
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,770
consistencies through it like you do see

549
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:57,899
a lot of sacred geometry stuff like you

550
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:00,720
will see like shapes that like you would

551
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,090
see like paintings of and stuff like a

552
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,589
good if you if you do go look at Alex

553
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,899
Gray's paintings those those are

554
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:09,659
excellent representations of what the

555
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,120
experience is like colorful wise and

556
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,740
like you know he often shows like a lot

557
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,869
of people and you'll see their insides

558
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,059
and particularly see people or their

559
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:22,500
insides but the concept of the colors

560
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:24,299
and and the the like beyond third

561
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,430
dimensional look that comes to his

562
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,079
paintings are very similar to like what

563
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,279
you see and there are other artists out

564
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,399
there but he's obviously the most

565
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:36,899
accessible II sure well-known and so a

566
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,880
bad experience is visually overwhelming

567
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,710
for a lot of people and it was for me

568
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,420
too the first time I did it because they

569
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:47,250
you know you are getting a fair amount

570
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,930
of ketamine there's just no but you know

571
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,980
you then become used to it by the set

572
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,850
you know what you're getting yourself

573
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,950
into it

574
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:56,129
round two and round three even though

575
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,360
that you're not in control at all at

576
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,759
least you know what's coming down the

577
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:03,418
pike right exactly and you know it's

578
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:06,750
it's exciting it's a it's overwhelming

579
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:09,419
but it is leading to a better change and

580
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,909
you do feel the change afterwards

581
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:13,950
sometimes the change is you know like

582
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:15,750
using baseball is if you may hit a home

583
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,058
run and it changes it immediately but

584
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,220
sometimes you have to hit four singles

585
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:22,379
to score a run right and so the same

586
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:26,100
thing goes with and and and the goal the

587
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:29,009
scoring of the run is having these

588
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:30,808
unique experiences that we don't know

589
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:33,628
exactly what they are but they are

590
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:36,359
laying down new neural pathways which is

591
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:39,388
the ultimate goal so that when you come

592
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:41,308
down off the ketamine and you've had

593
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:43,740
like you know some time to rest and you

594
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:48,569
integrate you're actually integrating

595
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:50,460
new neural pathways which somehow will

596
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:52,200
leave the depression yeah I think what

597
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,419
the way it was explained to me and I'm

598
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,190
not a neurologist by any means but what

599
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,350
happens is you when you get into a

600
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,500
depressive state you get pathways that

601
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:04,138
get stuck and they don't like unhook or

602
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,240
changed into other pathways and they

603
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:08,908
just kind of become dominant pathways

604
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,278
and so the ketamine really just unplugs

605
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:12,929
those pathways and then wires them back

606
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,240
to where they should be or into new

607
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:16,919
pathways I'm obviously not I don't know

608
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,960
100 percent but that's kind of how it

609
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,679
was explained to me is like that ring

610
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,028
around your head is what controls those

611
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,129
those depressive thoughts and those

612
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:27,628
anxious thoughts and it's good to have

613
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:29,128
depressive thoughts it's also good to

614
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:31,648
have an anxious thoughts it's just not

615
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:33,689
good to have them all 90% of the time

616
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:36,388
right and so I think that's what this

617
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,038
does is it really helps loosen that grip

618
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:40,138
that the depression gets on the

619
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:41,669
neurological grip right and it just

620
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:43,949
takes hold of your brain and doesn't

621
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:46,769
gonna let go and this ketamine really

622
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,509
loosens that grip so you know you you

623
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:49,620
can still feel sad when sad things

624
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:51,028
happen because you don't want to be

625
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,500
walking around life and like you

626
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:54,148
somebody tell you oh hey your father

627
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,319
just passed away and you know you had a

628
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:57,569
great relationship with him and you're

629
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,960
like yeah there it is things happen you

630
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:59,460
want

631
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,288
able to grieve and I want to have the

632
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,288
full range of emotion right yeah you

633
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:05,730
just don't want to be constantly like

634
00:25:03,288 --> 00:25:07,859
yeah everyday or just stuck in the

635
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:10,860
valley you know and so I think the

636
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:13,558
ketamine really helped me in a way kind

637
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,609
of loosen up it was a slow loosen up you

638
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:16,379
know when you're when you're anxious

639
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:17,639
you're tense and when you're depressed

640
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,740
you're like don't want to be around

641
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,340
anybody and the ketamine kinda just took

642
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,960
the tension away it took away the

643
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:27,959
consistent thought of wanting to kill

644
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,940
myself when that was all I mean I for

645
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,829
three or four months all I could think

646
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,480
about was how am I gonna do this

647
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:34,889
like what what's the way in which I'm

648
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,419
gonna do this because I don't wanna I

649
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,919
don't want to like suffer for a long

650
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,270
time I was trying to kill myself I just

651
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,278
wanted to end I don't want to do with

652
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:44,278
anymore and so it just kind of removed

653
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,829
that like overwhelming focus I had on

654
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,409
how am I gonna do this and then it was

655
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:51,689
it shifted more towards well no now I

656
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:54,179
got my [ __ ] back together how do I get

657
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,519
out of being homeless how do I get out

658
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,880
of doing moving on from here and and and

659
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,619
just going and so it was it was

660
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,770
overwhelming but it was worth it it's

661
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:07,048
like it's like going on an adventure and

662
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:10,139
a safari and you get stuck in the jungle

663
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:12,210
and you didn't plan on it but you got

664
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,528
out and now you have an awesome story to

665
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,630
tell people for the rest of your life

666
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:18,480
that like I did some amazing things in

667
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:20,340
the jungle I ate plants I've never seen

668
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,319
before drank off of leaves and you know

669
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:24,538
did the and slept under trees and stuff

670
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,099
and it's like a rebirth yeah and it was

671
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:27,269
difficult it was hard it was

672
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,428
overwhelming but I

673
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:32,099
it changed my life it changed me for the

674
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:35,000
better it made me a stronger person so I

675
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:37,859
know that you did three of the

676
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,339
intramuscular shots in the clinic firs

677
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:43,819
and then um and then you you what's

678
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:46,109
called it a tranche at Roche approach

679
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:50,099
when you describe it it sounds like

680
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:51,959
doing liquid acid on it essentially it

681
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:53,959
is like us like a sugar cube yep a

682
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,460
little bit of oral ketamine in it yes

683
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,160
they had about 100 milligrams of

684
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:01,819
ketamine per dose I was told to take 100

685
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,800
milligrams per session at home and I

686
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:08,029
found that 200 milligrams was a little

687
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:10,250
bit better setting for me and so yeah so

688
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:12,619
I basically at that time period I was

689
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:15,440
living in my car sleeping in my car so

690
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:18,649
I'd set up the car in a way that I had

691
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,360
an air mattress put the SUV so I put the

692
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,430
back seats down put the air mattress in

693
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,879
there I had a couple heavy blankets and

694
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,320
then I had the the eye mask as well and

695
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,910
dr. Agrawal had mentioned you know you

696
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:31,899
really should play some music along with

697
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,880
it something that has like a calm

698
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,410
relaxation to it you know oftentimes you

699
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,880
hear that meditative music then you get

700
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,529
it like a yoga studio or something like

701
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,230
there's something you vibe with exactly

702
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:44,180
I chose the Grateful Dead for my first

703
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,120
session Dix picks volume number one

704
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:50,930
seemed to be a good idea and it went

705
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,659
really well this session the the troj

706
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:57,230
sessions are much softer than the

707
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,630
intramuscular sessions you can go off

708
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:01,789
into kind of a slight another dimension

709
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:04,610
like I when I was listening to the Dix

710
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:07,879
pics Grateful Dead session it felt like

711
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:09,229
I was on stage at the show that day like

712
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,150
Jerry was off to the right playing his

713
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,559
guitar Bob standing next to me I can

714
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,110
hear the boys banging on the drums in

715
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,720
the back and so that and you've got that

716
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:20,059
mask on running in your car right yep so

717
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,000
your your brain is creating the

718
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,659
experience of seeing the band yes to go

719
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,130
with the music

720
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,400
yeah and that's interesting so it was

721
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,080
really kind of like a happy experience

722
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,700
for me I've never seen the Grateful Dead

723
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,409
before and so like I was like

724
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,569
overwhelmed like oh my god Jerry

725
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,000
Garcia's play guitar right next to me

726
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:40,309
and so it was very came out of that one

727
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,759
was like a very happy attitude the other

728
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:48,109
two sessions that I did in my car I

729
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:51,950
actually downloaded music that was like

730
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:54,079
to a certain hearse 432 Hertz it's

731
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,620
supposed to be like a tone in which is a

732
00:28:54,079 --> 00:29:00,379
healing tone and so that really helped

733
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:03,529
kind of like create like a own

734
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,150
mental cycling exactly and that I think

735
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:06,950
that music is because that was similar

736
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:11,450
to the music that Sunil had played in

737
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:14,000
the doctor's office and to jump back to

738
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,680
that temporarily really quickly one of

739
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,549
the experiences I had in there with him

740
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,740
was he I was on the floor and coming out

741
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:25,000
of the experience I was maybe the last

742
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:28,099
30 minutes of the the experience and I

743
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,619
had the mask off and I was my eyes are

744
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:33,169
open I could see the office very mildly

745
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:36,079
hallucinating but but not in a train

746
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,300
tranquil state kind of Sunil had asked

747
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,609
if he could meditate above my head so he

748
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:43,909
I was on the floor and he set back here

749
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:47,569
in Lotus and was meditating over me and

750
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:49,940
at the same time he would ring a singing

751
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:52,299
bowl singing bowl yes and every time he

752
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:55,580
rang the singing bowl I would howl

753
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:58,000
uncontrollably to the pitch that well

754
00:29:55,579 --> 00:30:00,500
the bowl was making yeah and I was like

755
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,039
but you know I'm like and he's like okay

756
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,710
that's crazy

757
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,960
oh and so vicki was sick and it got to

758
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,539
the point where he gotten so much energy

759
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,850
moving through my body that my arm like

760
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:13,609
unwillingly went and just grabbed

761
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:16,309
Sunil's head and like just I held onto

762
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:19,250
his head and I could feel like an energy

763
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:20,990
beam coming out of his head like I could

764
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,700
feel his it's like human energy and I

765
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,829
told him I was like I feel all your

766
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,690
power and he didn't budge he just kept

767
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:28,519
it was awesome because he just kept you

768
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,680
know meditating and he was totally with

769
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,000
the situation any stain like exactly he

770
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,560
wasn't like what are you doing grabbing

771
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,960
me I have a doctor like this is

772
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,179
unprofessional like he went with it rode

773
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,269
with it and it was an amazing feeling

774
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,100
for me it really kind of like boosted my

775
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:45,769
energy I don't know if I was sucking

776
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:48,649
energy out of his head or if it was just

777
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:51,980
the the him allowing me to do that like

778
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:54,410
better personal vision contact yeah kind

779
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,240
of like made my energy like enhanced or

780
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,700
something of that nature so that was a

781
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,690
very interesting experience to me that

782
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,069
made me feel really good after the after

783
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,910
that comes out of the experience but

784
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:09,889
back to the churches the experience with

785
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,029
the the instrumental music at the the

786
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:14,420
432

787
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:18,139
was extremely beneficial after the

788
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:21,200
second and third troj I think it did a

789
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:25,009
total of four of them after the second

790
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,730
third roach session I was almost

791
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:30,259
completely like healed and I felt like a

792
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,509
completely different person

793
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:34,670
not in the sense that like I'm not Tyler

794
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:36,769
Marquardt anymore I'm Bob Johnson or

795
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:39,860
whatever it was more that like I had a

796
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:42,410
clarity in my head and and zero focused

797
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:46,099
towards depression zero focus on anxiety

798
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:49,269
I mean this is from me being 38 years of

799
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:52,009
eating and forcing myself to eat or

800
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:53,960
since being 13 years old smoking weed

801
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:55,490
before every single meal because that's

802
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,860
the only way I can get through eating a

803
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:59,809
meal is it's getting high and forcing

804
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:02,240
myself well certainly over the last year

805
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:05,359
you know you're doing these seven and

806
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,309
then and then integrating them you know

807
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,729
you're currently a less miserable friend

808
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:12,919
yes before before you got turned on to

809
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:15,049
the ketamine you know you were a good

810
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,150
friend yeah and you were freaking

811
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:19,549
miserable and a negative person yeah and

812
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,890
a lot of people had told me that and I

813
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:24,549
recognized that myself that I was not

814
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:28,150
happy it ruins personal relationships

815
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:31,490
ruined business relationships it ruined

816
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:33,860
dating relationships and so it was a

817
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,150
major problem in my life and I had to

818
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:36,349
change something you want to either way

819
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,940
right and you need to take care of

820
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:42,980
myself or him you know off myself so um

821
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:46,580
so let's uh let's move to wrap this up

822
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,779
so so this is a pretty specific video

823
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:50,659
right you're going to be talking about

824
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:51,920
ketamine at this level so so probably

825
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:56,560
the only people who are still with us

826
00:32:51,920 --> 00:33:00,080
are people who are either depressed and

827
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:04,869
looking for solutions or people who are

828
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:08,149
looking at ketamine for other reasons

829
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:10,009
that they're looking for relief from and

830
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,810
and then maybe they're using this video

831
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:17,390
as part of their decision-making process

832
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:19,450
right yeah so what do you what would you

833
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:23,170
say or what are you going to say

834
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:28,090
to anybody who is watching who may be

835
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:30,009
considering ketamine therapy just like

836
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,839
you know if they were something that you

837
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:34,420
were chatting with and and they brought

838
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:37,000
it up and what do you have to say to

839
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,769
them directly to I don't know help them

840
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,410
figure out whether or not ketamine is

841
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:43,720
gonna be for them yeah I think it's one

842
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,060
of those situations where it's

843
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,529
individual so it's it's gonna be

844
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,940
different for everybody some people may

845
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:51,069
have a quick reaction to it some people

846
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,279
may not but it's worth it it's worth

847
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:55,119
trying it it's worth changing your life

848
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,950
for the better

849
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,769
because you can you that opportunity out

850
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,900
there is there and the nice part is is

851
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:03,549
some insurance companies do cover it

852
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,720
like I had unfortunately paid out of

853
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:06,879
pocket because I didn't have any health

854
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,918
insurance at the time but it was also

855
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,869
very affordable for the sense of what

856
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:12,159
you're looking for I'm not going to

857
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:14,109
comment on the what the pricing is

858
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,940
because I think the person changed so I

859
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:18,760
wouldn't be on point as far as that goes

860
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:23,110
but it is affordable it's less than rent

861
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,060
for a month for most people and so that

862
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,340
I think is there is a solution out there

863
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:29,409
and I think one of our biggest problems

864
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,090
is is we have this controlled substance

865
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:32,859
act which is limiting our ability to

866
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:35,829
access drugs that can really help people

867
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,809
and ketamine is on that that list and so

868
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:40,690
I think really getting that stuff

869
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:43,869
changed on the government level will

870
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:46,300
make a major impact in all of society's

871
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:47,980
life because people will have access

872
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,900
towards medication that can really

873
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,179
change their lives it worked for me it's

874
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,740
worked for a multitude of other people I

875
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,559
think it's starting to become more

876
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:58,479
accepted like just like psilocybin is 4

877
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:02,170
micro dosing and LSD is 4 micro dosing

878
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,630
now and I think people if you just have

879
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:09,180
the opportunity to to look into it a

880
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:13,690
little bit more and face that fear of

881
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:15,309
overwhelming psychedelic experience you

882
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,220
can get to a totally different place you

883
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:19,449
can be happy you can change who you are

884
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:21,339
I mean you're you're the best

885
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:23,500
representation of this because you and I

886
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,950
have a lot of interaction together on a

887
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,329
daily or weekly

888
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:29,089
the basis where we talk to each other

889
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:32,719
and you really did see that I was an

890
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:35,360
angry [ __ ] you know and you have seen

891
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:38,419
me change to somebody who is less angry

892
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:41,210
and and and I don't have that mentality

893
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,670
anymore and and I'm just extremely

894
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:46,730
grateful for Sunil

895
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:50,030
for Allison and for all the other people

896
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:52,789
at the the clinic who helped me they and

897
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,830
everybody at the clinic is it couldn't

898
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:58,759
be a better person for that situation

899
00:35:54,829 --> 00:36:00,679
mild temperaments just welcoming arms

900
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,210
you know I mean Sunil will give me a hug

901
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,129
every time I came to the office you know

902
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,230
like most doctors don't even come near

903
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,210
you or like shake your hand you know and

904
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,659
this doctor has given me a hug and

905
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:14,059
welcoming to the office so I think it's

906
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:17,289
you know when the individual is ready to

907
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:19,730
make the change because it's also like

908
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:21,739
the depression has to get to a point

909
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,789
where you need to admit you need to

910
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:24,829
acknowledge that you need to make a

911
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:26,539
change and I think that that's the

912
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:28,429
hardest thing right because the

913
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:29,690
opportunities out there for people but

914
00:36:28,429 --> 00:36:31,879
now you have to take advantage of the

915
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,590
opportunity and that's the only way

916
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,390
you're gonna grow nobody can force you

917
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,370
to be happy nobody can force you to be

918
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:39,199
better you have to make that decision

919
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:41,900
yourself and say I want to be better I

920
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,779
want to make this change there are tools

921
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:49,160
out there for for me to access that in a

922
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:51,110
legal manner there are the Ames

923
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,519
Institute is not the only Institute in

924
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,360
the United States who's doing this

925
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:55,460
therapy there

926
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,840
I believe the therapies in Chicago in

927
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,940
New York as well I'm a hundred percent

928
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,250
sure where they were located but I know

929
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,710
there are other offices that are located

930
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:06,289
a friend of Mines father did the therapy

931
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:09,829
in New York but he did it under drip IV

932
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:12,380
as opposed to inner muscular but he he

933
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:13,400
did not have as much of a response to it

934
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,140
as I did

935
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,369
he's also old or too so I don't know if

936
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:21,500
that experience had any time with it but

937
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:24,460
but like I said first it's different for

938
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,599
every individual and I think really

939
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,039
looking into it and reading those

940
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:31,699
ketamine papers the book is actually

941
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:33,380
called ketamine papers and going on to

942
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:34,349
PubMed gov and doing other research

943
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,090
about ketamine and see

944
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:37,949
what's out there do the research because

945
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:40,800
you're the only one who's in control of

946
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:44,039
your life and you have the ability to

947
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,750
make the changes if you want to it can

948
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,489
be really hard and challenging and

949
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,559
overwhelming it's like when you're in

950
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:51,269
that state any action can be a

951
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,980
depressive action right like whether

952
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,929
your shoelaces are untied you trip and

953
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,719
fall you drop a glass they can just

954
00:37:54,929 --> 00:38:00,119
spiral into just almost like a suicide

955
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,909
thought process because it's just your

956
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,529
world is crumbling but there's a light

957
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:06,599
at the end of the tunnel that light is

958
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:10,380
provided by ketamine and other

959
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:13,349
substances and I think people need to

960
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,530
get that negative mantra of drugs are

961
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:19,110
bad you know everything is bad in excess

962
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:21,000
some people react to things differently

963
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,890
I can eat cheeseburgers all day and not

964
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,079
gain any weight because I have IBS right

965
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:26,969
cheeseburgers aren't bad for me but you

966
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,299
know most of America is not doing too

967
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:31,230
good you know I think it's an individual

968
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,550
thing but again I think the

969
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,059
opportunities are out there and

970
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,680
opportunity is the biggest and best word

971
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:39,690
that we can have in our in our culture

972
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,000
because that's what leads to growth and

973
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:46,110
leads to the betterment and that

974
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,849
opportunity can only be taken when you

975
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,500
want it to right like if you want to

976
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:52,230
change then you can make it happen and

977
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,809
you'll figure it out and but just know

978
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:58,110
that the tools are out there to help you

979
00:38:53,809 --> 00:39:00,119
and again even when you're on that when

980
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:02,280
you're consuming the tools and and after

981
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,170
you've consumed the tools it's still an

982
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,110
active process of wanting to be better

983
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,599
and and you you just need to change your

984
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,610
your whole mentality to bettering

985
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,440
yourself bettering the environment

986
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:16,920
around you not particularly like you

987
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,200
know doing KNF or like soil regeneration

988
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,630
but more like keeping your yourself

989
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,219
clean like showering and like needing

990
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,630
health self-care yeah self-care and

991
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:26,730
self-love and that kind of stuff which

992
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,750
is I think all very difficult for a lot

993
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,090
of people especially

994
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:34,510
in America where I think we're in a

995
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:36,190
state where the patriarchy is a big is a

996
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,230
big problem right and like people are

997
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,420
struggling with male-dominated

998
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,389
industries and male-dominated things and

999
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,690
a lot of that comes down to I think we

1000
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:49,119
could have a major shift in society if

1001
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:52,570
that male dominance thought process was

1002
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,849
was rewired to a process of non

1003
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:57,880
dominance but Association and

1004
00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:01,360
cooperation and and moving forward in a

1005
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:04,869
way that everybody can have opportunity

1006
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,340
and access to to opportunity because

1007
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,589
that's really what it comes down I think

1008
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:12,010
opportunity is the big big key here is

1009
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:14,260
there is opportunity and and people can

1010
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,300
take advantage of it but I think America

1011
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:20,470
struggles right now with wanting to get

1012
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:23,260
out of that classic materialistic

1013
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:25,269
mindset which is you know has

1014
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,420
overwhelmed us for the last 50 years I

1015
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:31,030
think it's it can't be any surprise that

1016
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,460
you know somebody with his bombastic of

1017
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:36,610
a personality as you it would take like

1018
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:38,559
a serious hallucinogen for you to find

1019
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,349

1028
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,639
edge of this and there's not a lot of

1029
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,269
people who've done ketamine under

1030
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,199
doctors care at this point and in

1031
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:09,670
