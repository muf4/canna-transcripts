2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:13,320
cannabis is retaking America it used to

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,088
be the most relied on tincture in every

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,480
home until it was demonized in the early

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,250
1900s but now it's back even more states

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,289
will legalize cannabis this November

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,719
there's enough momentum now between

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,000
business activists and patient activists

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,969
that the door on cannabis will simply

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,410
not close again patients everywhere are

11
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,879
getting relief from using different

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,759
forms of the cannabis plant and

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,859
entrepreneurs smell opportunity and many

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,920

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,780

60
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,449
cannabis policy transfer so welcome to

61
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,610
the show dominant I'm glad you could

62
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:21,159
join us Thank You Shango glad to be here

63
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,500
so Dominic Wynn Colorado and Washington

64
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,209
first began to write rules for cannabis

65
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,560
sales you know what they had never done

66
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,300
this before some of the approaches

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,219
worked well while many of them pretty

68
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,340
much did not so now we're at the point

69
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:35,139
that Alaska and Oregon are in rulemaking

70
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,060
and there looks to be maybe six more

71
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:38,889
states in play to begin licensing

72
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,289
cannabis sales after the November vote

73
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:43,268
do the new states appear to be learning

74
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:46,449
from the best and worst practices of

75
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:48,159
Washington and Colorado a little bit but

76
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:51,399
not in a particularly formal or

77
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,439
organized way hmm I think that the news

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,420
cycle is probably driving a lot of

79
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,519
attention to things such as pesticide

80
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:01,679
regulation which is a big oversight I

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,509
think early on in our process and

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
that's one good example so the other

83
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:08,048
states get to start where we are right

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,729
now instead of taking for years to come

85
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,099
around to you know the fact that this is

86
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:14,469
of some concern for public health and

87
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,530
safety you know I think that's a really

88
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:20,819
good point that you make that the the

89
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,039
the media role that they play in

90
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,709
policy transfer between the states to

91
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,139
what degree do the other states

92
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,170
regulators find out what's going on in a

93
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:33,608
target state by just reading the news

94
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:37,449
versus talking to the regulators in

95
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:40,000
states that you know directly by getting

96
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,469
on the phone and calling them you know I

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,269
actually don't think it's all that

98
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:45,819
organized so I've been paying pretty

99
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,500
close attention and as you know I kind

100
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,269
of brought up this possibility of bad

101
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,909
policy transfer between Washington and

102
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,250
Oregon maybe even maybe a year ago when

103
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:57,209
Oregon's seem to be you know moving

104
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,590
towards a more of a strict approach

105
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,299
but you know in the subsequent year

106
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,849
organs also kind of backed off and fix

107
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,980
some things so I think that's a it

108
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:09,068
really depends on how organized where

109
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,929
the industry is in terms of their

110
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:13,530
conversations with their lobbyists and

111
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,519
their legislators I think it depends on

112
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,810
conversations between industries and

113
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,370
different states there's plenty of

114
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,199
people who are developing brands and

115
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,348
different states they have experience

116
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,689
with you know policy in one state and I

117
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:27,918
actually probably think that it's

118
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:29,870
through you know yes that a lot of

119
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,449
policy transfer possibilities open up

120
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,269
mmm that makes a lot of sense so what

121
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:36,800
you're suggesting is that the the

122
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:39,109
lobbyists are actually doing the

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,910
homework for the regulators and going to

124
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,800
other states and figuring out what the

125
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,350
best way to go is and then bringing that

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,629
to the legislators yeah I believe that's

127
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,790
the case for the most part certainly

128
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:51,399
there's some cross-border interaction

129
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,290
you know

130
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,939
I'm not that familiar with you know the

131
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,830
personal lives of politicians in

132
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,629
different states but for the most part

133
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:01,639
these people when they when they're

134
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:04,219
outside the state they're probably

135
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,370
discussing national issues and there's a

136
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,070
lot of those besides cannabis I think

137
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,600
that's also in the case of Washington

138
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,300
you know most of our legislature just

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,040
was so sick of it anyway they they don't

140
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,160
really

141
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,620
care to chat too much um

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,050
so you know there's there's not a lot of

143
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,879
sort of formally organized caucuses for

144
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,400
example their regional caucuses where

145
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,259
you know members of different political

146
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,079
parties but around the same issue get

147
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:35,269
together and try to coordinate I think

148
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,159
that will come and certainly the case of

149
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,930
California

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,539
since it's like about 25 other states

151
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,699
you know and one you know you're going

152
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,649
to see a lot more that's sort of

153
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,569
interest state level that still has to

154
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:49,038
happen actually it has to happen not

155
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:52,099
just between states but between

156
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,779
jurisdictions so many jurisdictions you

157
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,460
know are still they haven't even learned

158
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:58,609
the lessons from other jurisdictions

159
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:59,870
your own state yet yes I'm seeing that

160
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,870
all the time and you know it's really

161
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,189
frustrating to to realize how you know

162
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,509
what they say you don't want to you

163
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:07,788
don't want to see the sausage being made

164
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:10,159
and it's and it's really astonishing you

165
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:13,069
know at each state you've got you've got

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,289
them making regulatory attempts at the

167
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:17,209
state level which then get kind of

168
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:19,099
remixed at the county level and you've

169
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:22,099
got people you know passing moratoriums

170
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,870
or chaining changing zoning laws and so

171
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,580
that's happening at each state and then

172
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,978
and then this so the states are talking

173
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:30,709
to each other either via lobbyists or

174
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:32,659
the media or you know political visits

175
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,189
and some of that gets transferred and

176
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,470
some of its not and then and then the

177
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:38,829
different groups you know concerned

178
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,330
parents or investors these these

179
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:42,550
different groups have different amounts

180
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:45,129
of power at these different states it's

181
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,780
it's really a pretty chaotic mess and

182
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:48,670
it's kind of frustrating to see

183
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:51,429
something that we all care about as much

184
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,890
as cannabis to be handled this way but

185
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,930
it's also

186
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:57,300
it's also a primer in how a government

187
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,280
actually works

188
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,750
that's true that's true especially you

189
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,299
know government by initiative I would

190
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,949
say you know

191
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,949
the citizens initiatives have been how

192
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,539
canvass policy has been changed which

193
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,939
means we've been sort of leading them by

194
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,390
the nose you know to come along and do

195
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:19,079
this now I would say that it probably

196
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:22,449
will get a little more organized around

197
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:26,099
revenue policies I think that that's

198
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:28,389
something that that politicians are

199
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,040
particularly interested in and that that

200
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,529
that's what how they view you know

201
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,200
cannabis as a you know a new cow to milk

202
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:38,579
and I think that it's far more likely

203
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:42,339
that we will see a little more

204
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,319
you know harmonization let's say on tax

205
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,209
rates

206
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,719
as that information will be sought out

207
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:50,889
by local and state policymakers for

208
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,410
those of us who don't have a lot of

209
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,418
experience talking about policy or

210
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,010
thinking about policy I'd love to flesh

211
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:59,079
out a little bit you said you know well

212
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,269
this is what you get when you legislate

213
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,800
by initiative and I'm assuming you know

214
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:06,490
you're comparing legislating by

215
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,310
initiative versus you know law passing

216
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,199
by the state Congress can you can you

217
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,990
kind of describe the difference and why

218
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,479
you kind of gave that that nod to the

219
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,240
challenges of initiatives sure

220
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,370
initiatives push the legislators to do

221
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,949
something that they clearly weren't

222
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,470
going to do that's their whole point the

223
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,729
legislators because if they were going

224
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,160
to do it they would simply you know

225
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,889
rewrite laws or write new laws so this

226
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,779
is a democratic mechanism essentially

227
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:39,479
for

228
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:39,478
going around let's say the the

229
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,919
inertia I guess of

230
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,629
policy agendas in a more sort of

231
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,688
conservative and fixed and Static

232
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:55,989
environment nice a jurisdiction you have

233
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:57,428
set up concerns which reflect the people

234
00:08:55,989 --> 00:09:00,069
who are already politically and

235
00:08:57,428 --> 00:09:02,338
economically included in the states so

236
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:05,318
an initiative usually takes

237
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,449
people who are not not already

238
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:10,298
politically and economically included

239
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:14,558
and gets their message to policymakers

240
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:16,058
and forces their hands and certainly you

241
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:17,669
can see in the Washington State

242
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:20,019
initiative process

243
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:21,878
not only did they have to force their

244
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,769
hand but they told the legislature they

245
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,379
had to lay off the initiative for two

246
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,149
years they couldn't touch it because

247
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:29,798
it's understood with an initiative that

248
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,289
you're pushing them to do something they

249
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:34,119
don't want to do and so you got to give

250
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:35,849
it a little room to breathe before they

251
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:39,970
just kill it

252
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,558
you know that I can see how actually I

253
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,790
didn't know that they put in the policy

254
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:44,139
that they couldn't touch it for two

255
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:45,759
years and you know that that can't

256
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:47,739
imagine how that way actually makes

257
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,860
everything that much more challenging

258
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:52,839
because not only are are the people

259
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,188
pressuring the legislators to do

260
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,470
something that they were not necessarily

261
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:59,048
ready to do or at the very least didn't

262
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,230
have the inertia for but now suddenly

263
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:04,389
the legislators have to get educated on

264
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,119
best practices and how they want to go

265
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:08,889
about it maybe not but grudgingly but at

266
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:11,220
least on topics that they were not

267
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:14,110
already educated on I mean we saw that

268
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,119
both in Colorado and Washington as far

269
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,938
as how they're interacting with patients

270
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:20,678
and then recently last legislative

271
00:10:18,938 --> 00:10:23,919
session in Washington with the passing

272
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:25,778
of 50 52 which was erroneously called

273
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,849
the you know the Patient Protection Act

274
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:30,338
which actually kind of gutted most of

275
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,069
the patients rights and and we found

276
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:36,279
that you know so many of the legislators

277
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:38,948
were being educated by the commercial

278
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:42,220
cannabis lobbyists I think that that may

279
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:45,789
have made me be less likely in states

280
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:49,119
where it's not passed by initiative

281
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:51,278
where the Congress folks have got the

282
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:51,879
ability to to do their homework in

283
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,668
advance

284
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,149
first

285
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:59,918
well you know I

286
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,778
kind of agree with you there I think

287
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:04,600
that's one of the things that we're

288
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:07,409
learning through the cannabis situation

289
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,750
is how in fact our legislators

290
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:13,149
are educated and the fact is they're

291
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,528
educated usually by industry and

292
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:19,539
particular special interests so once the

293
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:21,549
initiative has passed there was a period

294
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:24,219
of interest formation right in the

295
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:25,809
cannabis industry that kind of gathered

296
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,050
in the ones who were a little more

297
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:30,489
organized and had a little more

298
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:32,919
access in other words they they topped

299
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,579
into you know folks who were a little

300
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,250
more politically and economically

301
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:38,828
included already and just use those

302
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,659
channels then the legislators got

303
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,859
educated to the extent they wanted to be

304
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,110
educated on and way more than they

305
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,850
wanted to I mean it's it's it's they

306
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,159
still don't want to be educated Shango

307
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,589
what they want to know is what's the

308
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,389
fiscal note how much is this is going to

309
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:53,709
cost and how much is it going to bring

310
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:55,690
in and that's about the extent of what

311
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:58,448
they want to know about it and so this

312
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,720
is kind of the the danger of it going

313
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:03,549
forward that's this will be the primary

314
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,110
education they will receive in the

315
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:08,639
primary mode in which they will operate

316
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:13,089
and and and change laws I think it's

317
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,409
interesting the possibility that there

318
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,670
will be more

319
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:20,528
instead of initiative the legislative

320
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:22,479
cannabis reforms we can see that this

321
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:24,698
has happened with medical marijuana in

322
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,990
particular already obviously we're

323
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:27,879
probably a long ways off from a

324
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,100
recreational law that's passed by a

325
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,139
legislature legislature

326
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,129
unless California happens to you know

327
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:38,769
not pass the AMA Act which it looks like

328
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,629
they're they will but it's it's it's up

329
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:43,019
in the air

330
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:46,299
and so

331
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,100
so it's really you know who are the

332
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,909
stakeholders really that are kind of

333
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,620
forcing legislators to make a decision

334
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:54,370
really and that's really what comes down

335
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,339
to you is they're going to make a

336
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,230
decision most legislators who are not

337
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:01,149
the primary sponsors of the bill or

338
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,209
otherwise part of some political

339
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:07,750
calculus are being told by their party

340
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:10,328
how to vote basically so there's still

341
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,639
not educated Shango if there's a lot

342
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:14,198
more work to be done to actually educate

343
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,129
them on anything more than really the

344
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,809
fiscal note

345
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,578
so let's let's look at this from the

346
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:22,939
perspective of states that have not

347
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:24,979
passed recreational or adult use laws

348
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,399
yet because you know so far we've talked

349
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,190
about you know Alaska and Oregon and

350
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,990
Washington and Colorado and we're all in

351
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,550
the process of sorting this out and

352
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,440
figuring out how to make this work for

353
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,049
everybody but there are other states

354
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,690
that are early enough in the process

355
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:44,448
that they can take actions to educate

356
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,190
their policymakers so that you know a

357
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:48,258
maybe they get it right the first time

358
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:52,009
or at least closer to the closer to

359
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:55,159
right and and B they can involve the the

360
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,990
rule makers in a way where they see the

361
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,328
bigger picture because you know in all

362
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,789
of the states that have passed laws

363
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:03,828
already it seems that the gaps are not

364
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:05,419
that the people or the legislators are

365
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:08,028
bad it's just that they're under

366
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:10,278
informed what would you recommend for

367
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:12,828
folks in states that have not passed

368
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:16,458
laws yet on how they can get ahead of

369
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:17,870
this and educate their regulators so

370
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,458
that they can you know get something

371
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,339
passed from the beginning that tends to

372
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:25,818
work better

373
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:27,829
yeah man well I'd say that they really

374
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:31,129
have to understand that they would have

375
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:32,688
to pull off beats of organization that

376
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,278
we have never seen from the cannabis

377
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:37,629
community

378
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:40,028
and I want to be very serious about that

379
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:42,769
our cannabis community

380
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:45,019
consists of a lot of people who as I

381
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,818
noted earlier are not already

382
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,639
politically and economically included in

383
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:51,289
the system their interests they're

384
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,829
militant interests in cannabis in

385
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:59,198
particular do not translate well in

386
00:14:54,828 --> 00:15:01,909
conversation with legislators and

387
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,899
honestly there's a reason for that and

388
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,458
it's not just because it's about

389
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:06,919
cannabis it's because they're not part

390
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:08,869
of the system it could be you know

391
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:10,068
tangentially related to the fact that

392
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,740
they can see in cannabis or have

393
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:15,019
radically different beliefs about

394
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,329
punishment Society but these are

395
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:19,039
minority beliefs and the only way for a

396
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:22,099
minority to become powerful is to get

397
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,308
extremely organized and I got to say

398
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,709
again the canvas community has never

399
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:29,539
pulled it off really

400
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,949
even in California for at the statewide

401
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:32,719
level

402
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,759
that initiative the dense Peron was

403
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,620
runnin was not going to succeed until

404
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:43,639
Ethan Adelman came in with DPA money and

405
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:45,289
you know actually you know changed the

406
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,889
language a little bit and also got the

407
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:51,349
money out there from signatures so

408
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:53,509
for a law to work our entire culture has

409
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,159
to change Shango it's gotta change from

410
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:57,588
the bottom up

411
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:01,159
there has to be more tolerance of I

412
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:02,720
think dissident beliefs you know distant

413
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,539
beliefs are founded on evidence in

414
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,430
particular they can be presented

415
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:09,110
logically and isn't as in the interests

416
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:11,479
of the people who otherwise don't really

417
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,060
care you know there's a lot of

418
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,829
depressing ideas than that honestly but

419
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:17,778
it kind of reminds me of that that that

420
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:19,609
statement they say oh you have you go to

421
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:21,708
war with the army you have you know it's

422
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,019
like well well you know we may want our

423
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:27,349
cannabis scene to get more organized and

424
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,149
raise more money and and and be deeper

425
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,269
in our experience but this is all

426
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:34,669
happening now and so even though it's

427
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,980
going to be messy and chaotic hopefully

428
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:39,740
the more states that legalize the better

429
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,839
we're all going to get at it and and we

430
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,759
can get smoother with implementation as

431
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,949
we go so let's go ahead and take our

432
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,569
first short break you are listening to

433
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:50,259
shaping fire and we're talking with

434
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:53,060
Dominic Corbin

435
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:55,519
as a business owner you are incredibly

436
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:57,859
busy in reality you are responsible for

437
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,778
everything your company does you have so

438
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,730
many responsibilities every single day

439
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:03,799
that often you just don't have the time

440
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,558
to really dig into something as deeply

441
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,789
as you'd like you know there is more

442
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,039
that you could do to reach out to new

443
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:11,928
customers and to encourage oil tea and

444
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,759
the customers you already have but you

445
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:15,650
certainly don't have the time and you're

446
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,140
not ready to hire someone full-time for

447
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:21,829
that role either for you I recommend

448
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:24,140
blunt branding blunt branding principles

449
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:26,328
Kirsten Nelson and Anthony Garcia are

450
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,580
focused on improving your bottom line

451
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:30,889
you know most marketing firms are

452
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:33,139
excited to make your logo packaging and

453
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,090
website very pretty but they leave

454
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,340
responsibility for improving your bottom

455
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:39,709
line up to you they don't want that kind

456
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:41,329
of responsibility but that is pretty

457
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,420
much the most important part of

458
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:47,029
marketing right Kirsten and aunt we'll

459
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,070
help you engage new customers funnel

460
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:50,899
them to your point of sale and keep them

461
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:53,480
coming back to you and telling their

462
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,340
friends no doubt this is a paid

463
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,650
commercial spot but that does not mean

464
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:59,809
they bought my opinion I've worked with

465
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,150
blunt branding on three projects now for

466
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,379
various clients and every single time

467
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,930
they have done more than they have

468
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,570
promised and over delivered on results I

469
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:11,120
love how they generate new revenue and

470
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:13,669
focus on that as the goal instead of

471
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,009
just making me a pretty logo similarly

472
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,840
every friend I've referred them to has

473
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:20,359
come back to thank me and that just does

474

Dominic before the break we were talking

494
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:12,740
about the level that legislators were

495
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,290
educated at and and your position was

496
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,930
pretty much they know enough to know how

497
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:19,430
to collect taxes and they want to know

498
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,560
how much tax money they're going to get

499
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,370
so that they can add that to the kitty

500
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:29,000
and you know the impact of that is a is

501
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:31,129
a an incomplete legalization because

502
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,250
while people are allowed to purchase

503
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,020
cannabis at stores and commercial

504
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,049
entities with licenses are allowed to

505
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:41,329
grow it you know we don't have decent

506
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:45,379
public toking laws in most of the states

507
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:47,240
the home grow numbers are very low that

508
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,820
that creates the situation where people

509
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,470
need to bring their grows in doors to be

510
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:53,689
able to you know get it grow enough for

511
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,819
themselves and and then some states like

512
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,009
Washington don't even have home grow so

513
00:19:55,819 --> 00:20:00,349
it's really frustrating folks that that

514
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:03,019
it feels like we have legalization but

515
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:04,869
we don't really because it was only

516
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:07,460
partial you know

517
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:09,559
considering the fact that that we are

518
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,200
making something legal that has been

519
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,690
historically taboo for so long you know

520
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,640
as someone who studies policy do you

521
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,590
think that this is what we should expect

522
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,410
I mean was is it too much for us to

523
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:22,970
expect to get full legalization right

524
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,100
off the bat cuz everybody's all freaked

525
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,539
out that it's legal at all yeah well

526
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,909
there's two things there I'm going to

527
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,909
start with the fact that really of

528
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,110
course we are you know legalization

529
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,600
basically means taxation or regulation

530
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:37,059
and it refers specifically to a

531
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,169
commodity really

532
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,519
legalization is about the commodity it's

533
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,930
about the plant as a commodity it's

534
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:44,450
something we exchange money for in

535
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,640
society that's very different from

536
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:50,920
legalizing you know a culture or a

537
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,300
people who tend to use that plant but

538
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,550
they themselves are not viewed as

539
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:59,119
terribly responsible desirable citizens

540
00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:01,519
in society so that's the objection to

541
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,219
home growing hence the objection to

542
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:07,069
public talking and so forth but the good

543
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,309
news is point number two is that this

544
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:12,409
does actually hit the state in its

545
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:15,769
revenue basket basically especially the

546
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:19,009
public smoking or event smoking you know

547
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:21,139
the homegirl maybe a little less so but

548
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:23,839
certainly I believe there's plenty of

549
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:27,230
incentive for the case we made the

550
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:29,389
lawmakers that you increase tourism that

551
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,829
you you know increase opportunities for

552
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,570
folks to make money increase

553
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:36,859
opportunities to collect taxes and so

554
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:40,460
forth by allowing for events by allowing

555
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:42,429
for you know the cannabis cafe as it

556
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,450
were yeah yeah

557
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,460
so do you think that it's just a matter

558
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,319
of time then that that you know the

559
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,950
legislators are putting themselves on

560
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:55,220
enough of a line to allow legal cannabis

561
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,740
to exist period and so after people get

562
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,049
used to to what's happened so far then

563
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,599
they're gonna move more into you know

564
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:04,339
social you know public social toking

565
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,839
places and increased home grow and

566
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:08,569
things like that where we're just you

567
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,720
know baby stepping it well it's going to

568
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:13,099
depend on the lobbyists

569
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,329
you know it's really it's not about them

570
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:17,000
getting used to anything it's about

571
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:19,399
essentially the priorities of the trade

572
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,529
organizations that are learning to use

573
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,420
lobbyists maybe a little bit better than

574
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,009
they used to for many of them some of

575
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,860
them already were pretty good at it but

576
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,179
that's common ground for all of them no

577
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:32,299
matter which lobbyist we're talking

578
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:35,110
about I think that it you know that that

579
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:38,299
is a little higher on the priority

580
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:41,319
homegrown less so in Washington states I

581
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:44,869
think that it will probably come around

582
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:47,029
a little bit more by osmosis and a

583
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,259
little bit more because you know every

584
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:50,960
other state is going to have a homegrown

585
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:54,259
even if it's restrictive so as far as

586
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,240
who those lobbyists folks are you know

587
00:22:54,259 --> 00:23:00,129
would you say that in most of the states

588
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,569
you've got one or two or maybe three Pro

589
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,750
commercial lobbyist groups and then

590
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:08,419
maybe one or two kind of underfunded

591
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,220
patient groups and then while there's

592
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,800
certainly a lot of law enforcement that

593
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,079
are in favor of of cannabis reform you

594
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,269
know you've got usually a law

595
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:20,119
enforcement Lobby that's trying to fight

596
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:22,220
it and maybe concerned parents and

597
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,049
religious organization I mean do they

598
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,380
tend to follow in these same flavors in

599
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:29,389
every state no I mean take a look at

600
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,250
California alone you know the makers

601
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,830
have sent you know you know our funding

602
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,690
you know on the proposition to tune of

603
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:38,480
half a million dollars it's

604
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:42,019
pharmaceutical corporation right you

605
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,380
have way way more and bigger interests

606
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:47,660
in California that it's it's calculus

607
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,790
you know calculus for you know as

608
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,210
opposed to you know algebra two

609
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:55,039
different in terms of the the various

610
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,289
interests how big they are how

611
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,000
widespread they are and how much money

612
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,859
there are as well as how many lobbyists

613
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,990
there are certainly the distributor's

614
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:05,029
have a lobbyists in California in a way

615
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,269
that distributors don't have a lobbyist

616
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:11,619
in Washington at this point not not

617
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:14,230
their own particular special interests

618
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:17,299
you have much bigger and more powerful

619
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:20,569
dispensaries in certain areas of the

620
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:22,490
states which are on their own quite

621
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:24,649
distinct in their interest from the

622
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,900
producers and proud

623
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,250
as opposed to here where they all kind

624
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,269
of like grew up a little bit together

625
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,190
because you reinvent the wheel

626
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:36,619
so

627
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,610
California's very different other states

628
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:42,798
it'll be a little bit more you know

629
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:44,928
more like youdescribe probably but the

630
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,079
California's just a big whale you know

631
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:49,940
it's what it does

632
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:52,339
affect so much of the market nationally

633
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,140
even if it's just the California state

634
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:58,339
consumption market which is obviously

635
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:00,460
it's not that it will have a bit more of

636
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:03,139
a distorting effect I think on

637
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,669
on what the other interests have at

638
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,620
their disposal in terms of arguments

639
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,509
yeah I think that makes a lot of sense

640
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:11,269
you know what's going on in in

641
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:15,048
California now their lobbyist groups

642
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:16,759
have had a lot more runway than Colorado

643
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:18,889
and Washington had because like you said

644
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,419
we reinvented the wheel we we started

645
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,620
from nothing so everyone was just trying

646
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,750
to get up to speed to figure out what

647
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:25,639
the hell was going on to begin with but

648
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,679
California not only has got a long

649
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,259
cannabis history but they've been able

650
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,780
to watch policy implementation in the

651
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:35,660
other states and so now people are

652
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:38,569
taking their positions earlier and with

653
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,400
more money so alright so let's talk

654
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:42,079
about California you know California is

655
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,780
like the eighth largest economy in the

656
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:47,539
world and and for better for worse it

657
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:50,509
does look like the adult use marijuana

658
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:53,000
have to is gonna pass and you know the

659
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,619
passing of that law in California is

660
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,230
probably going to hit the industry like

661
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:59,359
a tsunami you know what what impact do

662
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:01,039
you see that having on the national

663
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,659
conversation and maybe even more

664
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,329
importantly on the cannabis market

665
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:08,900
itself

666
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:11,289
well let me just say that's really it

667
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,240
was the you know

668
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:17,659
reformation of California's prop 215

669
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,539
just a year or two ago that has already

670
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:24,290
set off the tsunami described because

671
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:25,990
that which was legislatively driven and

672
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:28,129
also connected with Gavin Newson's

673
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,150
entrepreneurial policy approach to

674
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:35,590
campus politics

675
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:38,509
that set sort of a statewide

676
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:41,119
set of basic ditions for jurisdictions

677
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:44,390
to license and register the cannabis

678
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:47,989
market per se now the first two years of

679
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:50,090
it it really was about and is about just

680
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:53,329
kind of like getting getting your

681
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:55,459
paperwork in now they'll don't use some

682
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:58,819
marijuana act obviously you know when it

683
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,829
passes we'll have another set of things

684
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:03,349
but they're not going to be replacing

685
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:04,579
this very recently created medical

686
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:05,719
marijuana thing they're going to be

687
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:08,808
intersecting with in terms the

688
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,400
rulemaking the regulations and so forth

689
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:13,548
so it's not he's already started but

690
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,860
also the full how long it takes for all

691
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:19,129
this to happen I think that's a you know

692
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:21,889
the rules are set through like 2023 in

693
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,900
terms of when things happen in terms of

694
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:27,080
permitting and so forth so you're you're

695
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,120
gonna be looking at a few years of you

696
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,399
know continued volatile growth in

697
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,019
California which of course you know

698
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,500
already had the black market tsunami

699
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:38,150
going so I think there's a lot of

700
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,788
tension being posit focused on the

701
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:43,659
initiative it is significant

702
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:47,298
it will bring I think

703
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:51,140
new opportunities for new probably

704
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:53,359
investment players to participate but

705
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,100
otherwise will be a continuation of what

706
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,500
we've been going it's been going on

707
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:59,689
since 1970s in California you know the

708
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,900
Green Rush has never stopped in

709
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:06,590
California it's it's started in the 70s

710
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,240
and has never stopped and you know every

711
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:10,038
year it's gotten bigger when I arrived

712
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,870
in southern Humboldt five years ago

713
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:14,390
everybody thought wow it's just blown up

714
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:16,729
it's so huge all these strangers you

715
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,309
come here it's crazy I just saw you know

716
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,230
a note on a recent news article and

717
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:23,029
Humboldt that was talking as though

718
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,620
really in the last five years is when

719
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:26,839
it's really blown up and now it's not

720
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,729
now to control and so forth and I was

721
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,259
already hearing that five years ago and

722
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,880
then I realized well probably five years

723
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:34,579
before that people were saying that as

724
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,200
well and certainly the numbers seem to

725
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,899
bear out in terms of California market

726
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,330
economy

727
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,970
do you think that once California does

728
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:45,789
pass adult use that it's just going to

729
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,919
increase

730
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:51,839
investor confidence so that there's just

731
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,790
going to be all of the new investment

732
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,980
opportunities and laws passed in other

733
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,589
states because fighting like California

734
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,000
is like a tipping point absolutely

735
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:01,799
absolutely you know I mean people talk

736
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,180
about all states as other equal like

737
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,950
when we get to half the states with

738
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,080
these laws then Congress will have to do

739
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,590
something well it's it's not half the

740
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:13,589
states it's the right states really you

741
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:15,689
know and California is incredibly

742
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:18,599
economically powerful state it's

743
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,340
politicians will be you know it's

744
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:22,169
national politicians are connected from

745
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:24,089
there to the state and local politicians

746
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,320
and the political party machines they

747
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:27,389
will then be able to carry that to

748
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,329
Congress in a much more competent manner

749
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,040
Gavin Newsom has really blazed a trail

750
00:29:29,329 --> 00:29:34,589
in terms of you know approaching

751
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,990
cannabis like you know gay marriage in

752
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:38,519
terms of political capital so you got

753
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,339
ahead of the other politicians he

754
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,930
realized you know this is the way

755
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:44,849
society is going this is the way you

756
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,970
know the public is viewing things now

757
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:49,949
and you know what like I can get support

758
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,990
out of it as opposed to it being a third

759
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,809
rail that nobody can touch but you're

760
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,880
right certainly the the naturalization

761
00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:00,419
and internationalization of investments

762
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,280
into the campus industry alone that

763
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,259
California situation is going to open up

764
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,420
that will probably be the biggest

765
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:08,879
reverberate er in terms of how the

766
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,470
messages get national you know they

767
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,360
haven't even voted yet and you can

768
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,539
already feel it everywhere you can feel

769
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,759
people you know expecting it to pass and

770
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,740
therefore they're jumping in early and

771
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,720
getting their their ducks in a row and

772
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,250
getting their money raised and making

773
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,230
their context you can just feel it's

774
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,349
like a a whole bunch of cars that are

775
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,700
lined up at a starting game they're all

776
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:32,490
revving their engines and burning oil

777
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,740
and all ready for its a pass in November

778
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,500
to make the whole thing a reality it's

779
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,559
um it's actually rather enormous and

780
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,970
startling actually yeah but I mean I

781
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,089
just

782
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,710
reven through a little while now you

783
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:48,329
know

784
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,549
one of the interesting things that I

785
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:52,500
think California the biggest thing I

786
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:55,289
think for California at least Northern

787
00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:00,140
California is that I think that we're

788
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:03,569
gonna see the opening up really a more

789
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,528
more liberal zoning laws at and I don't

790
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:07,019
know if you understand this but

791
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:08,308
certainly like in the Bay Area you know

792
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,348
why don't they have hundreds of

793
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:12,479
dispensaries in the Bay Area well

794
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:13,368
because you know over the last 10-15

795
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:16,139
years

796
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:18,298
they reacted to medical marijuana by

797
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:20,158
almost immediately you know making it

798
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:21,778
impossible for there to be a location

799
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,769
for folks to sell it in a dispensary

800
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:25,288
it's not that they made that they

801
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:28,229
outlawed it they zoned it out and I

802
00:31:25,288 --> 00:31:30,388
think that this process will allow for

803
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:32,970
the zoning in a properties especially of

804
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,918
retail stores because it is kind of

805
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,048
ridiculous that the barrier has actually

806
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,269
so few

807
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:40,979
retail cannabis spots compared to you

808
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:43,288
know Southern California I'll light for

809
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:46,080
example I'm probably the highest capita

810
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:48,419
consumption of cannabis you know in the

811
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,348
country with most of that you know I

812
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,349
think going through the black market

813
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:56,908
you know it's interesting to think about

814
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:57,929
that because you know you're all like

815
00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:00,690
you know this has already been happening

816
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:04,679
for some time but it seems like the the

817
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:06,298
the industry as a whole has been held

818
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,639
back by the fact that they haven't

819
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:11,190
really gotten the full legal green light

820
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:14,368
which tends to keep all of this you know

821
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:16,919
legal capital on the sidelines and so

822
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:20,128
while California has obviously had this

823
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:23,159
this rolling green rush since the 70s

824
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:26,219
there were there were natural you know

825
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,080
barriers to entry simply because your

826
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,558
money wasn't necessarily safe and so a

827
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:34,319
lot of the legal money found it as too

828
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,579
high-risk and now suddenly that's all

829
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,098
going to be open and there's gonna be

830
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,618
this gushing influx of new and new

831
00:32:38,098 --> 00:32:44,038
investment capital it should be very

832
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:45,868
interesting to see how much you know

833
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:47,489
repetition in the market there is I

834
00:32:45,868 --> 00:32:49,348
would imagine that there's probably

835
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:51,778
gonna be this huge swelling in the

836
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:54,148
market and then you know probably a

837
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:56,308
bubble and then a shaking out of you

838
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:58,648
know secondary and tertiary players that

839
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,028
just don't have it in them to hang with

840
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:01,038
in what's going to be such a competitive

841
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:03,358
market

842
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,249
yeah but so much of California is

843
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,199
already oriented outside the state

844
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,519
anyway

845
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,739
certainly the newer investors they're

846
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,278
trying to capture you know California

847
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:16,069
state consumption probably are not

848
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:17,900
thinking about this the right way you

849
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:19,970
use California to jump into the national

850
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,550
market not used California to jump into

851
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,460
the California market

852
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:28,460
so right now the issue is that

853
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:31,819
legalization is still about California

854
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,400
and California's market and now you know

855
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:37,429
what what AMA allows you to do is right

856
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,580
maybe a business plan with a little more

857
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:42,950
confidence over a longer time frame

858
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:44,779
because you know you don't have an

859
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,110
initiative coming up every year as a

860
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:49,879
possibility to change things you know

861
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:52,189
now you kind of have a little bit longer

862
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,220
sight and can see how it's going to open

863
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:57,039
up you can identify you know which parts

864
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,140
of California are

865
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,149
particularly ripe for let's call it what

866
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:06,320
it is you're transitioning from you know

867
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:08,360
black markets oversupply into you know

868
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,440
white market regulated channels you know

869
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,930
what's gonna hold that up is going to be

870
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,380
taxes and I'm gonna it's still going to

871
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:18,589
be more expensive and in California you

872
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,059
know a lot more expensive than the black

873
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,530
market which is absolutely full of it

874
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:24,440
and the investors are not you know

875
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:27,800
pouring their money into that and they

876
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,990
want to you know transform or capture as

877
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,230
much as the black mark as they can and

878
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:35,689
they will be running straight into the

879
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,909
desire to policymakers to put a huge tax

880
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:41,230
on it and a series of huge taxes local

881
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:44,029
state counting

882
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:46,150
they're starting out lower than we are

883
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,860
obviously ours is probably a

884
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,090
you know at 34 percent I don't think

885
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,309
anybody else can be starting with that

886
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:54,740
but our 34 is another nine plus you know

887
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:56,299
whatever else people put on it I think

888
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:59,419
we're gonna be starting at 17 in

889
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:02,180
California probably at the state and

890
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,260
then you're gonna get you know was there

891
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:06,289
in the Bay Area I think there's already

892
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:08,050
a five percent they Oakland something

893
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:10,389
like that

894
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:12,590
so I

895
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:14,539
don't know you know the investor money

896
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:17,329
has to go towards something very

897
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:19,820
concrete with a business plan that they

898
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:21,230
understand already and I believe that

899
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,019
the money really should be going into

900
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:26,800
probably branding because that's the

901
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:29,300
first thing that gets jumped state lines

902
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,970
what they want to do is probably gobble

903
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,980
the smaller actors

904
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:35,289
buy them out or take their brand and you

905
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,599
know put it on steroids

906
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:39,829
you know really ready it for you know

907
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:42,019
something bigger than kept the

908
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:44,449
California market I think that's really

909
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:47,389
insightful when you say that California

910
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:50,569
more than being its own market interest

911
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:52,309
is actually just the the gateway if she

912
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,650
will to the rest of the national market

913
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:56,960
it's it's it's it's it's you know since

914
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:00,380
there is not federal legalization yet

915
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,630
it's kind of like the the minor leagues

916
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,269
where everybody is getting trained and

917
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,309
ready for federal normalization when

918
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:08,690
then they can then roll out to the rest

919
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:10,219
of the company that makes a lot of sense

920
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:12,200
hey we need to take another short break

921
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:14,559

welcome back you are listening to

shaping fire I am your host Sheng go low

960
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:44,759
son our guest this week is dr. Dominic

961
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,608
Kaurava of the Center for the Study of

962
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:48,838
cannabis and social policy so before the

963
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:51,150
break Dominic you know we were talking

964
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,920
about how important California was

965
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,949
because it's the eighth largest economy

966
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,499
in the world and how even more than just

967
00:37:55,949 --> 00:38:00,150
you know wanting to open business there

968
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:02,669
for its own sake because California is

969
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,959
such a big market of how it's actually a

970
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:08,940
gateway to the rest of the nation once

971
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:10,528
federal legalization takes place and you

972
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,409
know you know folks who are looking

973
00:38:10,528 --> 00:38:15,268
ahead on how their businesses are going

974
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:17,998
to evolve over the say the next ten

975
00:38:15,268 --> 00:38:20,639
years they have to be aware of the

976
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:22,828
possibility of international players as

977
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:25,588
well because you know once we get to the

978
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:27,959
point that that product can move across

979
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:31,108
state lines so someone might be able to

980
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:33,719
produce it in in California or Texas and

981
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:37,170
then ship it to you know Connecticut or

982
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:40,139
or Colorado or Arkansas or whatever once

983
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:41,759
those borders are sorted out you know

984
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:44,639
that there's gonna be people pushing to

985
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:46,469
be able to start bringing in product

986
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,509
internationally and you know people

987
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:50,729
places like Mexico and earth way are

988
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:54,539
already thinking about you know let's

989
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:56,848
grow outdoor cannabis here let's convert

990
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:59,278
it into oil and let's ship that to

991
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:02,099
United States you know what do you think

992
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:04,559
of is the likelihood that that will be

993
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,119
an aggressive timeline that will happen

994
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,489
rather quickly because you know there's

995
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,430
a lot of folks who are planning on

996
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:14,190
producing cannabis oil in the US but if

997
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:16,348
suddenly Mexican cannabis oil is coming

998
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,088
in you know to be used in edibles and

999
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:20,009
all you know this huge market you know

1000
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:21,538
that's gonna just crush the prices here

1001
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:23,509
how do what do you see in your crystal

1002
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:26,910
ball as far as that's concerned

1003
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:28,708
well it's already happening the CVD you

1004
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:30,449
know in terms of international lines and

1005
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:32,940
so forth it's against the law but the

1006
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:35,789
policy seems to be the little alone I

1007
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,588
was contacted recently by some CVD

1008
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:38,900
company that you know opened up in

1009
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:41,728
Seattle and

1010
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:44,459
I don't know what they thought I did but

1011
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:45,838
you know they wanted me to you know get

1012
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:49,228
some advertising from them or something

1013
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:51,119
like that but basically you know I was

1014
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:52,980
like well you know first of all

1015
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,680
I can't do that we're a federal

1016
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,929
non-profit 501c3 and we don't do you

1017
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,389
know we don't buy or sell cannabis you

1018
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:02,308
know we're Research Service but the

1019
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:04,618
other thing is obviously the the

1020
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:07,019
International hemp oil scene you know a

1021
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:09,440
lot of it was in China probably still is

1022
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:12,838
but love is now coming from Europe

1023
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,809
from German happened so forth and it's

1024
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:18,078
being you know shipped absolutely across

1025
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:19,829
international lines is being shipped

1026
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,400
products that are approved by the FDA

1027
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:24,359
the big ships and powder crystals and so

1028
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,608
forth

1029
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:28,139
so that's one thing it's already

1030
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:31,038
happening it's happening especially

1031
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:34,170
through CBD however

1032
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:37,049
your rights you know you got to look at

1033
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:38,970
other countries that's are going to be

1034
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:40,259
willing to export and able export to

1035
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:43,679
other countries before they're able to

1036
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:46,349
export to the United States so Columbia

1037
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,690
right off the bat is planning on

1038
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:50,700
essentially you know treating cannabis

1039
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,259
like coca in terms of medical cannabis

1040
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:55,379
and exporting it to the rest of Latin

1041
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:57,358
America like Bolivia and Peru exports

1042
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,989
certainly coca leaves to other parts of

1043
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:03,298
Latin America so you know Columbia is

1044
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:04,889
already on that in Latin America we'll

1045
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:06,690
see what happens out there elsewhere in

1046
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:08,088
South Asia you know in India certainly

1047
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,349
there's a

1048
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:13,788
dr. Seliger well you have to ask him a

1049
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:16,470
little bit more about that but you know

1050
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:17,940
the South Asian markets will cross

1051
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:19,139
borders although you've got the

1052
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,480
Philippines right there and they're

1053
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:22,889
ready to kill anybody who's you know

1054
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,829
accused of being a drug dealer right now

1055
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:28,409
so you have some weird things going on I

1056
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:31,470
think that's with the United States it

1057
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:33,239
is going to be a while before it's able

1058
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:36,238
to cross state lines and that actually

1059
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:38,159
might put us behind in terms of our

1060
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,170
ability to export our own product

1061
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,420
because Colombia will of that practice

1062
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,809
and the India will have had practice and

1063
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:49,130
so forth but

1064
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:49,130
the way things work here

1065
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:55,259
you got a look at our trade agreements

1066
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:58,318
actually and it'll be interesting the

1067
00:41:55,259 --> 00:42:00,420
moment you start seeing cannabis medical

1068
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:02,038
cannabis or otherwise start to be

1069
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,239
written into trade agreements is when

1070
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,819
you start to get it across the border so

1071
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,789
we have NAFTA right we have TPP we have

1072
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:13,358
CAPTA we have you know actually an

1073
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:14,769
interlocking you know Byzantine maze of

1074
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:17,048
trade agreements all over the world that

1075
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:20,558
a result of the last gen 30 years of

1076
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:21,538
globalization and you know those things

1077
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,048
I

1078
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:30,189
think they changed slower than

1079
00:42:25,048 --> 00:42:32,079
our drug policy laws here so that's one

1080
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:35,498
thing that I would I would say is that

1081
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,479
we're gonna develop our own internal you

1082
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:39,399
know

1083
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:41,468
possibly export market maybe even will

1084
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,880
start to get its a Congress doesn't act

1085
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:45,400
after California's maybe we'll start

1086
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,380
getting like a West Coast trade zone for

1087
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,349
cannabis or something like that that

1088
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:54,130
starts to open up but it's gonna be in

1089
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:55,869
fits and starts it's it's really it's a

1090
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,608
little unpredictable but certainly I

1091
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:00,640
don't think it's happening anytime soon

1092
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:02,798
I think it's happening outside of our

1093
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,429
country very soon I think Columbia is

1094
00:43:02,798 --> 00:43:08,858
going to be doing it right away

1095
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:11,048
but not to the United States but to

1096
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:12,518
other Latin American countries wow

1097
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:14,858
there's so many there's so much to chew

1098
00:43:12,518 --> 00:43:16,419
on there I mean for speculation that

1099
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:18,338
seems to suggest that an you know

1100
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,619
American investment capital that wants

1101
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:22,018
to get involved with cannabis might be

1102
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:23,818
better informed

1103
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:26,108
by

1104
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:27,998
investing in the third world since

1105
00:43:26,108 --> 00:43:30,188
they're going to be moving faster

1106
00:43:27,998 --> 00:43:32,068
because they've got a smaller regulatory

1107
00:43:30,188 --> 00:43:33,748
structure and perhaps

1108
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:36,278
less

1109
00:43:33,748 --> 00:43:38,139
trade agreements to worry about so

1110
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:40,208
that's number one number two it's

1111
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:43,298
interesting to consider that you know

1112
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:46,659
the the various you know protectionist

1113
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:48,818
ways that the United States goes about

1114
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:50,858
things could actually put us in the

1115
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:53,619
backseat as far as international trade

1116
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:55,978
on cannabis and then I guess the the

1117
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:58,209
idea that folks are already doing it now

1118
00:43:55,978 --> 00:44:01,208
you know bringing bringing you know

1119
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:03,688
crystallized CBD from hemp in from from

1120
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:06,969
China and everything really shows how

1121
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:08,618
often policy can be made by selective

1122
00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:10,719
enforcement because it's already illegal

1123
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:12,059
to do that but for the time being they

1124
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,048
don't seem to be

1125
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:17,680
enforcing against it which suddenly

1126
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:19,449
default makes it pseudo legal

1127
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,308
it's a weird kind of version of you know

1128
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:25,480
our own you know medical cannabis laws

1129
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:27,609
years ago this default kind of like you

1130
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,440
know policy of a black and porous where

1131
00:44:27,608 --> 00:44:31,440
lower priority and enforcement

1132
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:37,088
which opens things up you know it would

1133
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:38,528
be very difficult now to I think you

1134
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:40,838
know take down all the people who are

1135
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:42,579
importing had products in terms of you

1136
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:45,608
know international financial capital

1137
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:47,230
investing well I'll tell you exactly how

1138
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:49,869
that works Shango it's it's it's about

1139
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,309
Real Estate's so international financial

1140
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:53,829
capital especially when it comes to

1141
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:56,260
agricultural products is about real

1142
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:58,390
estate it's about buying the land it's

1143
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,609
not about making money off of these very

1144
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:03,699
very cheap perishable you know

1145
00:45:00,608 --> 00:45:05,500
agricultural commodities and I you know

1146
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:07,659
Latin America is not going to be

1147
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,099
treating you know cannabis is anything

1148
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:11,528
other than agricultural commodity and

1149
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:13,420
medical one sure but you know it's not

1150
00:45:11,528 --> 00:45:14,858
going to be and you know added value

1151
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,440
industrial product or anything like that

1152
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:20,078
so I think that when you guys look at is

1153
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,630
you know where people buy property but

1154
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,160
also distribution

1155
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,390
international distribution I also think

1156
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:27,190
that that's something we didn't touch on

1157
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,679
in California it's a very important part

1158
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:31,750
of the scene is that folks who want to

1159
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:35,460
make a bundle off cannabis distribution

1160
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:37,869
is probably going to be huge

1161
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,909
it didn't kind of happen that way in

1162
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,140
Washington

1163
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:43,960
but that's one of the ways in which

1164
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:45,519
California is going to show these are

1165
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,889
little states essentially with the

1166
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,949
little cannabis markets how it's done

1167
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:53,348
and I do believe that distributors are

1168
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:56,769
going to play a huge role especially

1169
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:59,200
because of the way we have all these

1170
00:45:56,769 --> 00:46:01,059
various compliance issues with you know

1171
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,230
the tracking of cannabis and we'll

1172
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:05,230
continue to do so for the foreseeable

1173
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:08,048
future so the intersection of tracking

1174
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,849
and distribution is going to be huge and

1175
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:12,630
if you look at international financial

1176
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:15,910
capital look at where it buys land

1177
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,910
so so before we go too far away around

1178
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:20,769
the away from the international topic

1179
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:22,899
you know it I think this is an important

1180
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:25,869
point to point out for folks who are

1181
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:28,180
considering getting you know processing

1182
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:30,660
licenses in their own state because

1183
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:33,059
folks when they're when they're gauging

1184
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:35,219
their risk they're thinking okay well

1185
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:37,079
you know we know that the marijuana is

1186
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:39,989
gonna sell and we know that there's

1187
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,340
going to be brands from our state and so

1188
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:43,319
since we know that the you know that

1189
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,510
essentially the sales cycle for cannabis

1190
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,580
at the beginning is do you have weed yes

1191
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,369
sold right that that a lot of people

1192
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:52,440
jump in just believing that if they can

1193
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:54,119
get the license that they can set up

1194
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,579
their business that they can just stay

1195
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:59,369
in business and find enough capital that

1196
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:02,069
that their product is guaranteed to sell

1197
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:04,039
and and even if it's going to be a

1198
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:07,050
decade before

1199
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:09,719
you know any kind of cannabis oil is

1200
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:12,330
going to be imported from say Mexico you

1201
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:14,339
know ten years is not a long time when

1202
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:17,940
investing a half million dollars in

1203
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:20,340
setting up a processing company at the

1204
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,769
state level and I think that I think

1205
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,990
that it's a good time to remind folks to

1206
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:27,150
gauge their risk and not get in over

1207
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:30,118
their heads because you know this this

1208
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,980
cascade of one tsunami after another and

1209
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,930
then the law changes and now suddenly

1210
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,940
you know the potential for state to

1211
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:39,329
taste a transfer and then international

1212
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:41,070
it's gonna be a bucking bronco ride for

1213
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:42,539
you know a good 20 years and people

1214
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,150
should make sure that they're ready for

1215
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:46,909
that before they invest their retirement

1216
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:49,829
capital into it

1217
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:52,440
for sure for sure but I really don't

1218
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:54,750
think that there's as much of that you

1219
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:59,159
know retirement capital kind of

1220
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:00,539
investments that's happening a lot of

1221
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:02,849
the startups certainly for our state's

1222
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:04,349
were we're a little more like that but

1223
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:08,579
you know what a vestment capital likes

1224
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:10,230
to do is merge and acquire so they'll be

1225
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:11,789
going around looking for failing

1226
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:14,309
businesses they make people an offer

1227
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:16,340
they can't refuse and then they build

1228
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:18,869
their you know

1229
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,780
portfolio assembly essentially a you

1230
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:23,490
know real estate and production sites

1231
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:24,810
that I can network together and that's

1232
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:26,789
the way for the big guys and I think

1233
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:28,949
that's also the way for the smaller guys

1234
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:30,809
the folks who actually want to hang in

1235
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:32,329
there and be a part of this and said

1236
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:34,949
build it up and sell it

1237
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:38,159
which is a common entrepreneurial you

1238
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:41,368
know notion is that they are going to

1239
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,618
have to you know form cooperative

1240
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:46,410
enterprises of some sort you know that

1241
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:48,469
if you have horizontal merger merging

1242
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:51,449
going on as opposed to vertical merging

1243
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:54,179
then you're going to be able to I think

1244
00:48:51,449 --> 00:48:57,389
be a little more resilient then if

1245
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:59,518
you're if you just insist on sticking it

1246
00:48:57,389 --> 00:49:01,889
out on your own you know that's a really

1247
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:03,899
good point just because you know I've

1248
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:06,078
talked to so many folks in Washington

1249
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:09,119
and Colorado and Oregon

1250
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,219
who have you know started their mom and

1251
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,318
pop businesses with the intention of

1252
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:14,849
going national that doesn't mean that's

1253
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:16,498
how it's going to be going forward

1254
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:17,119
that's a really good point because now

1255
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:20,129
that

1256
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,460
you know traditional investment capital

1257
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,969
is feeling more

1258
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:28,679
confident and and the risk is decreasing

1259
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:31,528
we're gonna see more businesses taking

1260
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:34,679
over by acquisition and by you know more

1261
00:49:31,528 --> 00:49:36,748
traditional capital sources where it's

1262
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:38,489
not just going to be mom and pops that

1263
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:42,659
then you know get elevated to the big

1264
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:45,358
leagues and and and a lot of that

1265
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:49,170
capital is used to a higher amount of

1266
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:51,150
risk than you know me losing my

1267
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,680
retirement capital because I gave it to

1268
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:56,548
my uncle you know or something like that

1269
00:49:52,679 --> 00:50:01,368
yeah yeah sure sure Wilhemina when it

1270
00:49:56,548 --> 00:50:04,440
comes down to it a lot of the I

1271
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:05,999
don't know a lot of the investment when

1272
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,389
it comes down to it I think in the 5:02

1273
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:11,669
system started with $250 and everybody

1274
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:14,129
who actually paid that 250 bucks and got

1275
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:16,440
an application for something in that

1276
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,579
little 30-day window that we did not

1277
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,880
know would be pretty much the only

1278
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:22,589
window where that could happen

1279
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,210
you know those licenses licenses became

1280
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:26,278
commodities they became commodities when

1281
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:27,690
even if they're failing that began

1282
00:50:26,278 --> 00:50:30,719
commodities if you know you've lost

1283
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:34,739
everything you can still sell that

1284
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,420
license basically so you know the window

1285
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:38,309
for investment in the system for smaller

1286
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,460
folks I think that was it to be honest

1287
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:43,200
you know then in terms of the direct

1288
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,759
handling it's going to be tough to break

1289
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,618
into retail when they open up new retail

1290
00:50:44,759 --> 00:50:47,940
when does the state's gonna want the

1291
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:50,160
same retailers they're going to want

1292
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,028
people who've proven that that's been

1293
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,960
done they're going to want people from

1294
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:57,179
the list they already have so it's very

1295
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,740
interesting

1296
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,199
in a lot of ways that dynamic is the

1297
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:02,879
same as the New York taxi token you know

1298
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,259
where you know you're buying and selling

1299
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,630
these for you know a couple hundred

1300
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,490
thousand dollars or whatever because

1301
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:10,619
they're a limited they've become a

1302
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:12,779
commodity themselves that's right that's

1303
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:15,539
exactly right limited edition scarce

1304
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,280
resource yeah right on well cool well

1305
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,019
very good Don I think that's we're gonna

1306
