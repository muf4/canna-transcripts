2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,490
going into the California election three

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,710
weeks ago there was a powerful schism in

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,690
the cannabis community everyone agreed

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,100
that proposition 60 for releasing

6
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,679
cannabis prisoners from incarceration

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,810
was a necessary and overdue thing and

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,390
everyone also pretty much agreed that an

9
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,909
adult use law was necessary and over do

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,380
as well in California the schism was

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,240
whether or not you thought the design of

12
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,549
the cannabis market as spelled out in

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,159
proposition 64 was the right way to

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,439
legalized in california so now that the

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,179
proposition has passed the conversation

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,308
for the next two episodes of shaping

17
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,219

18

California's Emerald triangle and the

34
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,228
actions they will have to take to have a

35
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,478

consolidation in cannabis and how we

39

40
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,219
market and save the family farm this

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,920

clear as our usual episodes we ran into

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,368

Amanda thanks for having me I'm so glad

91
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,469
that you could make time with your busy

92
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,509
schedule are things calming down for you

93
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,479
a little bit more now that the now that

94
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:20,759
the election is over well yes and no of

95
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,699
course we are really excited that Prop

96
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,739
64 had victory here in California but

97
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,810
we're also looking to the horizon and

98
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,750
with questions about what the new

99
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,750
administration means for this new

100
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,159
industry amen everybody is kind of

101
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,969
scared about what might the next move

102
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,500
the of the president-elect maybe but

103
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,270
luckily we don't have to talk about that

104
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,400
one today we just need to tackle

105
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,040
California itself and you know

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,810
everybody's excited because now there's

107
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,449
a there's more clarity than there had

108
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,930
been before before you know medical

109
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,909
existed but it was you know parts of it

110
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,860
we're not quite as legal as some folks

111
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:01,259
wanted entrepreneur wise to get involved

112
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,230
but now with a clear green light from

113
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,789
the state folks are ready to jump in and

114
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,039
to bring you know their skills from

115
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:10,109
other industries so so we know that

116
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,659
California's going to be a multi-billion

117
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,610
dollar industry in and of itself as far

118
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,930
as the number of participants though do

119
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,180
you we have any idea of how many

120
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,670
cannabis companies will likely be formed

121
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,769
in California now Oh there'll be

122
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,870
thousands I mean we're not just talking

123
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,299
about companies that actually touch the

124
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,098
plant right so companies that

125
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,288
ro the plant that processed the plant

126
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:33,300
that distribute the plant but all the

127
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:35,310
ancillary services that go along with

128
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,680
the cannabis industry especially in the

129
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,110
tech sector and I think that given that

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,269
California has such a reputation of

131
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,979
being innovators when it comes to

132
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:47,279
technology that we're going to see a

133
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:49,889
huge cannabis tech sector in California

134
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,448
as well as the agricultural sector that

135
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,819
comes with actually producing the plant

136
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,530
and I think that's a really good point

137
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,689
to make because there are so many people

138
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,429
who see the opportunity in canvas and

139
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,199
they want to participate but it doesn't

140
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,090
mean that they have to go through the

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,829
highly regulatory structure of getting a

142
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:06,649
license or even dealing with the plant

143
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:10,589
there are so many support opportunities

144
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:12,299
when it comes to the licenses themselves

145
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:13,279
though let's talk about those and break

146
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,199
those out a little bit because

147
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,000
California has gotten more a higher more

148
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,098
variety of licenses than any other state

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,288
as legalized at this point what are the

150
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:24,449
different licenses well the licenses

151
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,759
were really outlined first under our

152
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,000
medical cannabis regulation and safety

153
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,699
act which was passed in 2015 by Governor

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,158
Brown as you mentioned even though we've

155
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,218
had medical cannabis in California for

156
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:40,829
20 years we've been lacking a state

157
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:42,718
level regulatory system meaning that

158
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:44,788
anyone that's operating in medical

159
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:47,879
cannabis currently in California is

160
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:50,459
doing so under a local license and this

161
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,019
is primarily just retailers we really

162
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,468
haven't seen the licensing of

163
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:57,318
cultivation manufacturing so our medical

164
00:05:55,468 --> 00:06:00,209
cannabis regulation and Safety Act

165
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:03,389
outlined licenses for this purpose and

166
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:06,418
then prop 64 adopted that licensing

167
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:09,960
structure with a few key differences so

168
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:12,778
both the medical program and prop 64

169
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,239
outline licensing not just for different

170
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:18,538
activities but different levels of

171
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,699
production within those activities so I

172
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:21,930
think that the boat was go ahead I was

173
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,949
going to say so there's different types

174
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:29,579
we cover cultivation testing

175
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:31,710
manufacturing transportation retail but

176
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,728
within each license category there's

177
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:36,989
room for small growers vs big growers

178
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:39,449
delivery services versus

179
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,249
brick-and-mortar dispensaries so even

180
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,619
within

181
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:45,979
each type of license there's variability

182
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:48,649
based on how big you are and the exact

183
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:52,038
type of company you want to have so for

184
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:54,678
example volatile extractions veeram be a

185
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:57,139
butane and other combustibles is

186
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:59,628
regulated differently the non-volatile

187
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:02,829
extractions such as temperature or

188
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:05,899
agitation I think that will find that

189
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:07,699
California going head and blessing the

190
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,918
kind of model that they used for medical

191
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,499
with some you know with some changes and

192
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:15,798
making it adult use will have a lot more

193
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:17,389
success like in Colorado which used a

194
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:19,638
similar model of blessing what they

195
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,129
already have versus the the kind of mess

196
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,379
that they have in Washington where they

197
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:26,599
set aside medical and created something

198
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,999
entirely new from from scratch

199
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:30,978
reinventing it as they went I think that

200
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:33,199
with as big as the market is going to be

201
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:35,449
in California that's one big advantage

202
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,119
from day one that will be helpful to

203
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:40,429
entrepreneurs there oh I agree and I

204
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:42,829
think that you know honestly one of the

205
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:45,078
reasons why after twenty years the

206
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,598
legislature finally did pass something

207
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,610
in California for medical is because

208
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,188
they knew that adult use was on the

209
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,538
horizon and they understood because of

210
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,539
what happened in states like Washington

211
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:59,658
versus states like Colorado that it made

212
00:07:56,538 --> 00:08:02,178
sense to set out a structure for medical

213
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:05,329
cannabis on and create that system

214
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:07,578
alongside the adult youth system or what

215
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:09,889
will happen would happen would be

216
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:11,538
similar to Washington which is to see

217
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,329
the medical system just kind of get

218
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:16,968
usurped into the adult youth system and

219
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:19,369
see patients not have the same kind of

220
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:21,558
access or the same kind of price

221
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:23,989
discount that they should have given

222
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:26,509
their patient status while we're talking

223
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:30,408
about medical there was a lot of concern

224
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:32,329
before the election that proposition 64

225
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:34,158
would would hearken the end of the

226
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:36,468
medical market and and you know there

227
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,778
were there were no provisions put in the

228
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:42,800
proposition to exclude it if anything

229
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:44,568
there were provisions to protect it but

230
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,878
based on what you know we saw in

231
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:48,678
Washington you know what do you think

232
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,308
the likelihood is that now that

233
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:53,480
commercial adult use cannabis is legal

234
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:56,990
that the commercial

235
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,360
lobbyists will will seek to squeeze out

236
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,339
medical because you know that's that's

237
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,659
now a computing market well I don't

238
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,790
think it's going to be a competing

239
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,919
market I think what's more likely to

240
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:11,990
happen in the coming legislative session

241
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:15,439
is a reconciliation of prop 64 and NCR

242
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,139
si they have the same agencies governing

243
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,449
the two programs there's no differences

244
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:23,690
in the types of products that adult

245
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:25,278
users can access versus medical users so

246
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,010
what I think we're likely to see at the

247
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:31,490
end of the day is a consolidated system

248
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:34,458
where patients get a financial break on

249
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,549
the cost of the medicine and those who

250
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:39,649
are 18 19 and 20 years old can access

251
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:42,049
cannabis with a doctor's recommendation

252
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,448
and that the price break for those

253
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:46,849
individuals is subsidized by the taxes

254
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:49,009
paid by adult users I think that that's

255
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,440
more likely going to be the model will

256
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:54,110
end up seeing given that the regulations

257
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,720
for medical and for adult use are so

258
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,230
similar well it sounds like the

259
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,970
integration of how they are going to be

260
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,470
regulated and since they're going to be

261
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,680
regulated by the same body will

262
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,319
definitely decrease you know conflict at

263
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,629
the regulatory side I just can't help

264
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:13,879
but think that the lobbyists in

265
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:16,490
commercial will will do everything that

266
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,559
they can to squeeze medical so that they

267
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,690
can start selling to those patients as

268
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,599
well and maybe with you know a different

269
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,819
tax rate but but to capture those folks

270
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,079
anyway because do you think that people

271
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,909
since they're selling the same things

272
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:31,309
won't people still tend to want to use

273
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:33,409
their medical cards and just to be able

274
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:35,568
to get the better price in the medical

275
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:37,969
market well I think it's primarily going

276
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,860
to be what I call a costco model where

277
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,870
if you're somebody that uses cannabis

278
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,509
frequently whether that be for whatever

279
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,129
reason it makes more sense for you to

280
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:48,189
get a medical card because you're going

281
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:50,958
to get a tax break every time you use it

282
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,149
versus somebody that uses cannabis maybe

283
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,708
every once in a while and doesn't really

284
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,328
make sense for them to go and get a

285
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,818
medical card and they'd rather just pay

286
00:10:56,328 --> 00:11:01,219
the tax so I think that there'll be

287
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:03,289
options for people who based on you know

288
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,590
how frequently they use cannabis the

289
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,899
thing is is that even though

290
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,300
we haven't had state level regulations

291
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:13,740
for 20 years we absolutely have an

292
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:15,479
industry so keep achoo kiva bang I mean

293
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,700
all of these companies have been in

294
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,220
California dispensaries for years now

295
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,030
and so it's not as if there's a whole

296
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,879
new flood or room for a whole new flood

297
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:28,709
of commercial products in California at

298
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,860
the moment because we really do have

299
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,960
quite a variety of commercial cannabis

300
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,240
providers right now today in the state

301
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,590
of California so while I do think that

302
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,930
there will be some diversification

303
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,389
because there may be products that

304
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:44,939
people in the adult use market want more

305
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:47,220
often such as low dose we're seeing you

306
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,170
know adult users more interested in low

307
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,690
dose products where patients are looking

308
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:54,809
for higher dose products so we will see

309
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,150
some diversification but at the end of

310
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:59,250
the day patients will have access to the

311
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:01,980
same products in the same name brands

312
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,629
that they have right now you know the

313
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,810
point that California already has a

314
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:08,879
strong exists pre-existing market was

315
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:11,159
made oh I guess it was three shows ago

316
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,409
we had dr. Dominic Kaurava on the show

317
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,669
from casp and he made the point he says

318
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,259
you know everybody's talking about the

319
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,909
Green Rush and the new Green Rush in

320
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,710
California but really you know

321
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:22,769
California started a Green Rush in the

322
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,540
1970s and it's just never stopped that's

323
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:26,939
accurate that's absolutely accurate and

324
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:29,039
you know when I go and give talks to

325
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,560
younger folks today want to get in the

326
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,209
industry who are interested in it I say

327
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,849
you know you're not going to be a master

328
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:38,580
cultivator and you're probably not going

329
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,610
to have a dispensary you know these jobs

330
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,800
are taken and you know our job with

331
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,629
regulation is to allow people who have

332
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,329
already been working in this industry an

333
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:49,860
entree into a legal market it's not to

334
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,590
pave the way for all kinds of new

335
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,139
companies to come in and so you know we

336
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,940
want folks who are already operating to

337
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,470
be able to come into compliance and I

338
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,690
think that's where we need to focus on

339
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,970
first because we do have so many

340
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,070
operators already here in California I

341
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,690
think that's a really good point and

342
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,120
what I want to talk more about the

343
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,070
specifics of the opportunities for

344
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,110
potential new entrepreneurs let's go

345
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,580
ahead and take our first short break you

346
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,580
are listening to shaping fire

347
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,778
as a business owner you are incredibly

348
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,209
busy in reality you are responsible for

349
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:27,159
everything your company does you have so

350
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:29,109
many responsibilities every single day

351
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,179
that often you just don't have the time

352
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,730
to really dig into something as deeply

353
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:35,169
as you'd like you know there is more

354
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,420
that you could do to reach out to new

355
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:39,309
customers and to encourage loyalty and

356
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:41,139
the customers you already have but you

357
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:43,028
certainly don't have the time and you're

358
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:45,850
not ready to hire someone full time for

359
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:49,208
that role either for you i recommend

360
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,370

361

Kirsten Nelson and Anthony Garcia are

362
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,959
focused on improving your bottom line

363
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,299
you know most marketing firms are

364
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,518
excited to make your logo packaging and

365
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,349
website very pretty but they leave

366
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,720
responsibility for improving your bottom

367
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,120
line up to you they don't want that kind

368
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,709
of responsibility but that is pretty

369
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,799
much the most important part of

370
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:14,409
marketing right Kirsten and Anthony will

371
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,449
help you engage new customers funnel

372
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:18,309
them to your point of sale and keep them

373
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,890
coming back to you and telling their

374
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:22,719
friends no doubt this is a paid

375
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,000
commercial spot but that does not mean

376
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,220
they bought my opinion I've worked with

377
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,559
blunt branding on three projects now for

378
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,759
various clients and every single time

379
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,328
they have done more than they have

380
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,980
promised and over delivered on results I

381
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:38,528
love how they generate new revenue and

382
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,259
focus on that as the goal instead of

383
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:43,389
just making me a pretty logo similarly

384
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,250
every friend I've referred them to has

385
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:47,649
come back to thank me and that just does

386
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,089

welcome back you are listening to

shaping fire i'm your host Shango louis

402
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,950
and our guest this week is Amanda Ryman

403
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:31,870
of drug policy Alliance so Amanda right

404
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,000
before the break you said something that

405
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,669
that stuck out for me you said that the

406
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,740
way that things are set up now it's

407
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:41,529
there's not really a lot of room being

408
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,070
created for new companies that really

409
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:48,089
the focus right now is going to be the

410
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:51,100
pre-existing market that exists in

411
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:53,110
California moving into the licensed

412
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,700
structure can you break that out for a

413
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,990
little bit for me more because you know

414
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,300
a lot of people who are listening the

415
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,659
show as are thinking about okay now that

416
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:04,179
adult use is legal let's take our skills

417
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:06,309
and move in to California cannabis and

418
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:07,779
and your suggestions seem to be that

419
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:09,789
just because the law has been passed

420
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,699
doesn't necessarily mean there's a ton

421
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:14,469
of room for new companies well I first

422
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,930
want to make the point that under prop

423
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,450
64 there is a California residency

424
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:21,639
requirement so you had to have been a

425
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:25,330
resident of California I believe back

426
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:28,179
from 2015 and that residency requirement

427
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,400
is until 2019 so if you're out there

428
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:32,019
somewhere else in the United States and

429
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,579
you live somewhere else you're thinking

430
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:36,789
I'm going to move to California and get

431
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,500
a license you are not because we wanted

432
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:40,179
to again ensure that those that have

433
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,820
already been living and working in the

434
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:44,739
industry in California have priority and

435
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,050
there's also priority to already

436
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,639
existing companies meaning dispensaries

437
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,639
manufacturers that have already been

438
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,279
existing but in this kind of gray

439
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,439
locally regulated area also have first

440
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,539
priority but that doesn't mean that

441
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,570
there's not room I think it's really

442
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:04,750
about where the need is going to be and

443
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:07,870
in California the need is not for people

444
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,578
to grow cannabis or sell cannabis or

445
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,729
even make cannabis products in

446
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:16,240
California the need is helping these

447
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:19,509
companies come into compliance so the

448
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,359
need is for software and for packaging

449
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:24,670
and for sustainable agriculture methods

450
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,740
and things that are going to help those

451
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:29,769
that are working in the industry make

452
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,710
the leap from the gray market to a very

453
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:34,750
heavily regulated system here in

454
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,900
California and I think the opportune

455
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:40,630
there are pretty much endless because

456
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,060
you're going to have a ton of businesses

457
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,220
that have been operating in a way that

458
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,649
is not satisfactory to California

459
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,390
regulatory standards and we're going to

460
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,340
have seed to sale and all of these

461
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,500
things that go along with regulation and

462
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:56,559
we're going to have to have companies

463
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,710
that can help those in existence comply

464
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,779
and be legal especially given the

465
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,940
scrutiny will likely face at the federal

466
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:05,799
level you know I think that's an

467
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,870
interesting aspect to point out there

468
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:13,089
that that just because licenses may not

469
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:15,459
be the way to go doesn't mean that our

470
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:17,199
listeners need to feel crestfallen that

471
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,299
they somehow can't get into the cannabis

472
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,700
industry because as you know I tell my

473
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:24,069
clients all the time you know if you can

474
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,170
come up with an idea that's not in that

475
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:28,299
this does not need a license you'll have

476
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,800
so much an easier time having your

477
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:32,289
business because your regulatory

478
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,029
structure will be so much less and that

479
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:35,559
when it comes to moving into any new

480
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,869
industry but especially the cannabis

481
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:39,940
industry that decreasing your risk as

482
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:42,099
much as possible is the name of the day

483
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,630
so so if folks are listening and they're

484
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:45,490
like oh wow are you telling me that all

485
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,350
the growers are already there it's like

486
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,150
yeah that might be the case but that

487
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:52,059
doesn't mean that it's there isn't tons

488
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,910
of opportunity for ancillary business

489
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:58,599
models absolutely anything that will

490
00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:00,550
help those in the industry do things to

491
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:04,029
be more compliant make things more

492
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:06,609
seamless you know introducing processes

493
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:10,059
to streamlined to make it easier for

494
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:11,879
people and every level of production we

495
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:14,950
haven't had that you know we've had

496
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,230
people doing the jobs we've had really

497
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,700
no infrastructure in this industry and

498
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,000
that's what's going to be needed in

499
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:25,180
order to keep up and satisfy the

500
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,500
regulatory demand mm-hmm so let's talk

501
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,060
about a little bit about rulemaking

502
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,150
because you know the proposition only

503
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:34,269
goes so far itself and then you know

504
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:37,030
there are groups that then have to jump

505
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:39,549
in to regulate their part of the bigger

506
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:42,059
pie and and as we've not found in the

507
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:43,509
states that are already legalizing

508
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,490
sometimes that

509
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:48,430
that secondary wave of rulemaking can

510
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,890
get awfully messy so who is actually

511
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,900
going to be implementing proposition 64

512
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,820
in California and what does that look

513
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,870
like for folks who are who are trying to

514
00:19:54,819 --> 00:20:02,379
understand the landscape so on both MCR

515
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:04,629
essay and prop 64 hand over the

516
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,870
regulatory structure and rulemaking to

517
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,460
the bureau of marijuana regulation which

518
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:11,859
is at the state level it's a state

519
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,590
agency and it includes representatives

520
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:16,389
from the department of food and AG the

521
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:18,909
department of public health the Board of

522
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,370
Equalization the Department of Consumer

523
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,680
Affairs and it also has an advisory

524
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:26,259
board made up of those folks plus

525
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,009
researchers from the public health field

526
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:31,329
people from the cannabis industry itself

527
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:35,289
patients right so people that have a

528
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:38,139
vested interest and prop 64 and mcrs a

529
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:40,750
really set out a blueprint for what

530
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,780
regulation will look like and now it's

531
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,759
up to this Bureau and with feedback from

532
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:49,089
folks in the state and in the industry

533
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,099
to fill in the blanks over the next year

534
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:53,139
not only is the bureau going to be doing

535
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:55,389
their due diligence and reaching out to

536
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,640
farmers and others to figure out the

537
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,560
best way to implement these practices

538
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,530
given what's already happening in

539
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:05,139
California but we're also going to have

540
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:08,200
to figure out how the licenses are going

541
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,960
to work you know how you apply for a

542
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,090
license I to kind of get all of those

543
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,240
wheels in motion that's something that

544
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:18,279
will also happen at the state level so

545
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,309
what's the time frame looking like you

546
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:24,549
know everybody was excited after you

547
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:27,940
know the election two weeks ago but now

548
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:29,950
now that that the the maybe even the

549
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,650
harder work has to happen if making this

550
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,569
all real you know how long are we

551
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,100
looking before the first licenses are

552
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:37,389
going to be handed out you know

553
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,589
obviously these are going to be

554
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,480
estimates but what are you what are you

555
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:44,230
thinking well the mandate from the

556
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,360
initiative is that January 2018 that the

557
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,819
state has to start issuing licenses by

558
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:49,490
January 2018 so it will take about a

559
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:51,649
year

560
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,569
that's what we saw in Colorado and

561
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,059
elsewhere now of course what we saw an

562
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:59,000
organ was that the state allowed

563
00:21:56,058 --> 00:22:01,819
dispensaries to start serving adults

564
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,569
before the licenses officially came out

565
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:07,339
for the adult use only stores and so we

566
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:09,950
may see something similar here in

567
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:12,889
California given that we do have license

568
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:15,830
dispensaries across the state I wouldn't

569
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:18,710
necessarily be surprised if we saw the

570
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:21,678
bureau getting close to that date maybe

571
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,480
not quite ready to launch everything see

572
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,490
a compromise with well if you're a

573
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,829
licensed dispensary you can now start

574
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,140
serving people 21 and up who don't have

575
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:32,269
a doctor's recommendation given that the

576
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,120
products are the same now an organ that

577
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:37,129
wasn't the case of medical patients had

578
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,889
access to different products than adult

579
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,380
users namely medical patients had access

580
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,450
to things besides flowers here in

581
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,790
California both groups have access to

582
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,100
everything so it wouldn't be unheard of

583
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:51,470
for someone who's now serving patients

584
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:54,740
with a doctor's note to open up that

585
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,179
service to those 21 and up my gosh that

586
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,009
would be such a windfall for all those

587
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:00,500
retailers my goodness that they're

588
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:01,879
already up and going and then as part of

589
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,940
the transition they might be able to

590
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,920
sell to anyone who's over 21 wow what an

591
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,360
opportunity it would be but then again

592
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,250
you have to remember that here in

593
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,799
California it's no trick to get a

594
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,900
doctor's recommendation so you know for

595
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,409
the most part a lot of the medical

596
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,110
cannabis population here in California

597
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:22,700
resembles the adult use population so

598
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,319
different than in other states where you

599
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,140
have very restricted list of conditions

600
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,329
for which people can become patients the

601
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,520
adult use market is quite different than

602
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:34,220
the medical market it's not necessarily

603
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:37,819
the same here in California so over the

604
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,308
next year the new regulations are going

605
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:42,829
to come together how to apply for these

606
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:44,839
licenses will come together and also the

607
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:47,720
folks who don't want to see this happen

608
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:50,539
will be making their moves to you know

609
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,759
in other states we have seen challenges

610
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:54,920
with moratoria by local municipalities

611
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:57,079
does it look like there will be zoning

612
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,970
issues in California like that to where

613
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:02,149
you know this is passed at the state

614
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,220
level but individual cities are

615
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,810
we'll pass a moratorium that says no you

616
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,059
can't do cannabis business here oh

617
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:10,970
absolutely we've already seen that we

618
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:13,700
saw places passing that before prop 64

619
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,500
even passed you know it's no secret that

620
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,110
California is a bit divided on this

621
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,910
issue and you have localities in the Bay

622
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:22,490
Area and elsewhere that are very

623
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,500
proactive that are really wanting to

624
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,839
study this issue and bring cannabis to

625
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,609
their localities in a respectful way and

626
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,230
then you have places that just hate

627
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,909
cannabis and they're going to ban it

628
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,579
outright and they want nothing to do

629
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:37,820
with it the thing about prop 64 is that

630
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:39,980
it denies local revenue to localities

631
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:42,019
that ban commercial cannabis businesses

632
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,599
so while I think a lot of these bands

633
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:47,180
are reactionary what we'll see is that

634
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:49,909
counties and cities whose neighbors are

635
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,500
regulating commercially their residents

636
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,720
are just going to drive 10 miles down

637
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,099
the road by cannabis and then all the

638
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,620
tax revenue is going to go to their

639
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:59,539
neighboring city so you know we do see

640
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,299
even a patchwork of alcohol regulation

641
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:04,609
here in California with counties

642
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:07,129
regulating alcohol differently but the

643
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:09,439
decision to become a dry County or a dry

644
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,510
City definitely has economic

645
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,180
implications now the one thing that

646
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:17,119
localities cannot do is they cannot ban

647
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,670
personal cultivation for adults so the

648
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,269
ability for each household to cultivate

649
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:25,480
six plants indoors or outdoors in an

650
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:28,460
enclosed structure away from public view

651
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,370
that right went into effect November 9th

652
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,519
and localities are not allowed to ban

653
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:38,269
that activity what's the nature of the

654
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:40,910
difference in legality between a city

655
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:44,079
hosting of business versus a city

656
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:46,009
banning individual personal gross mean

657
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,069
what's the difference between those

658
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:50,240
legally that that one can be done away

659
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:52,669
with at the local level and the other

660
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,230
cannot well you're really giving a city

661
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,019
the right to regulate commercial

662
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,599
activity within its borders not personal

663
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:01,339
activity so if you legalize possession

664
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,189
of cannabis the cultivation of cannabis

665
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:06,049
as a legal personal activity the city

666
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,390
does not have the right to ban that

667
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:10,009
activity they can tell you where you can

668
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,690
do it which we already did in the

669
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:13,789
proposition we said you either have to

670
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,500
do it indoors or if you're trying to do

671
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,629
it outdoor

672
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,910
it has to be away from public view to

673
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,580
cut down on the risk of robbery so a

674
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,830
locality cannot make a decision to not

675
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:26,500
uphold the rights given to an individual

676
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:28,419
under the proposition what they can do

677
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,730
is make a decision about which

678
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,279
commercial enterprises they want

679
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:36,069
existing within their borders and that's

680
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,559
another vote for entrepreneurs to start

681
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:40,869
ancillary businesses as well because if

682
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,879
you're not holding a license you're just

683
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:45,699
an HR company or a marketing company or

684
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,640
a software company with cannabis clients

685
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,160
versus having a license and having to be

686
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,259
worrying about local moratoria that's

687
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,970
true i mean that's definitely true in

688
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:56,740
terms of getting a business license and

689
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,990
getting into the business but you know

690
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,539
just as a cautionary tale we have had

691
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,130
several reports recently of people who

692
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:05,109
are involved in ancillary businesses

693
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,570
related to the cannabis industry like

694
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:09,639
legal work that have been denied home

695
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:11,919
loans and other types of financial

696
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,380
benefits because of the nature of their

697
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,150
work so you know just because you're not

698
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,310
selling cannabis or growing cannabis

699
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,050
doesn't mean there's not a risk that

700
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:22,119
you're taking being involved with the

701
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:24,220
industry and that's one of the reasons

702
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:26,199
why it's so important for anybody that

703
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:28,150
wants to get involved in the industry to

704
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,610
understand the movement and to

705
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,830
understand the activism that comes with

706
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:34,659
being a part of this industry because if

707
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:36,309
you're not ready to be an activist I

708
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,680
would caution you against getting

709
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:40,089
involved in the cannabis industry you

710
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,620
know that's another good point that you

711
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:43,899
were making because you know a lot of

712
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,819
folks are like okay the laws passed the

713
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,560
activism has been done I can just come

714
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:49,569
on in and start my business now and it's

715
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,179
like oh no no you're playing it too

716
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:55,119
simple you know cannabis entrepreneurs

717
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,700
have got to be activists both to you

718
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,009
know protect their turf from moratoria

719
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,069
to make sure that it doesn't get rolled

720
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:04,869
back and and also to be active in the

721
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:08,139
state legislature so that as the

722
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:10,149
rulemaking evolves it evolves in ways

723
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,790
that don't exclude or challenge their

724
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,290
own business model oh absolutely and I

725
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:17,470
have to say you know I've been so

726
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:20,170
impressed with the Sun grown farmers and

727
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,240
their willingness to engage with the

728
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,558
bureau during this rulemaking period

729
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,538
because that's

730
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:28,028
one of the biggest mysteries is like

731
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:29,679
cannabis farming and what are the costs

732
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:31,839
associated with it what's the best way

733
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,360
to tax it and regulate it and without

734
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,668
the cannabis farmers themselves coming

735
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:38,558
forward and being open and honest about

736
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:41,080
what they're doing and how it works best

737
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:44,019
we would definitely not be as far as we

738
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:46,808
are in terms of acknowledging the

739
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:49,359
usefulness of sunburn cannabis so it

740
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:51,428
really takes people willing to come out

741
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,079
and to be honest about their thoughts

742
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,999
and feelings about the issue but you

743
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,199
have to be aware and educated on the

744
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,929
issue before you can be an effective

745
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,999
advocate we are going to take another

746
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:06,669
short break and be right back you are

747
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:08,470
listening to shaping fire businesses

748
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:10,059
everywhere are constantly striving to

749
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,159
reach out to people through advertising

750
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:13,808
we all know though that trying to reach

751
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,970
a cannabis audience with a quality

752
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:17,648
message is pretty difficult that's why

753
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,589
many people choose to advertise on the

754
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:22,508
shaping fire podcast advertising on this

755
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:24,579
show allows us time to talk about your

756
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:26,378
product service or brand in a way that

757
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:28,898
really lets people know what sets your

758
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:30,668
company apart from others bold people

759
00:29:28,898 --> 00:29:32,199
who own companies know that getting in a

760
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:35,440
relationship with our customers is

761
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,480
essential that is what we offer we will

762
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,970
explain your service or product and what

763
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,159
sets it apart as desirable and help our

764
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,409
audience get in contact with you it's

765
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,480
pretty simple really advertising does

766
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:48,700
not have to be all whiz-bang smoke and

767
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,769
mirrors nowadays I find that people

768
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,379
prefer just to be spoken to calmly

769
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:55,240
accurately and with good intentions if

770
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:57,849
you want to make your own commercial

771
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,740
spot you can do that too because the

772
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:02,168

773
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,269

shaping fire I'm your host Shango Lohse

791
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,620
and our guest this week is Amanda Ryman

792
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:46,750
of drug policy alliance so Amanda right

793
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:49,329
before the break you were talking about

794
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:53,349
how important it was for Sun grown

795
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:56,289
cannabis growers to participate and get

796
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:58,599
their feedback and experience in into

797
00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:03,159
the regulatory process and you know a

798
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:06,009
lot of people are concerned that with

799
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,870
the great increase of cannabis growing

800
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:10,569
across the country but specifically

801
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:12,399
right now in California that electricity

802
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:14,619
consumption is going to skyrocket

803
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,620
because the demand for cannabis is going

804
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:19,409
to get so increased so quickly now

805
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:23,079
California is one of those places that

806
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:26,590
cannabis just loves and a huge part of

807
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:29,619
your industry is is being grown outdoors

808
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:32,919
or in greenhouses by the sunshine and

809
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:35,019
not from generated electricity what are

810
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,480
some estimates that people have been

811
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:40,569
discussing in California about what

812
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,750
direction the industry might grow as far

813
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:45,609
as electricity usage versus doing it in

814
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,789
greenhouses and taking advantage of the

815
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:52,750
Sun well I mean cannabis traditionally

816
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:54,399
has been grown outdoors it's a plant you

817
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,529
know just like any other plant the

818
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,269
reason why we saw cannabis cultivation

819
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:01,000
come inside was because of prohibition

820
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:02,889
and the fact that people had to hide

821
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,109
what they were doing I think that

822
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,710
there's a culture around that still that

823
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:10,779
we're going to see dissipate with time

824
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,910
but there are some barriers to moving

825
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:15,039
full into Sun grown I mean you know if

826
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,779
cannabis was not as stigmatized and as

827
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,240
demonized as it is right now all

828
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:21,579
candidates would be grown outdoors the

829
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,319
problem is that we have states that

830
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:27,009
legalized but you're not allowed to ship

831
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:29,740
cannabis between states so Massachusetts

832
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:31,480
or Maine baking it grow cannabis outside

833
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,190
all year round they have very harsh

834
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,009
winters but they're not allowed to

835
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,840
import cannabis from california like

836
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:39,910
they would import wine or other

837
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,829
commodities and agricultural products

838
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,050
that grow better in other parts of the

839
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:46,210
state they don't say well hey we'll just

840
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:48,039
grow our strawberries and doors they say

841
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,640
no let's get strawberries from other

842
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:51,670
places

843
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,500
where it's still warm in december so i

844
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,900
think that the lack of interstate

845
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,940
commerce really put some states in a

846
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,530
bind in terms of their cultivation

847
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,049
because it's going to be very difficult

848
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:03,670
for them to do outdoor which means

849
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:06,210
they're going to have to rely more on

850
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:08,440
the energy consuming indoor model

851
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:11,049
eventually when we're able to ship

852
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,269
cannabis between states I see states

853
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:15,909
like California and others that are

854
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:18,430
naturally made for cannabis cultivation

855
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,320
outdoors to start to fill the need of

856
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:23,009
the other states that they don't have to

857
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:26,470
rely so heavily on indoor production I

858
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:28,509
think that is an assessment that a lot

859
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,970
of folks in legalizing states are

860
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:35,079
missing when they are setting up their

861
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:36,460
indoor grows not necessarily expecting

862
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,899
that they'll be eventually an interstate

863
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,690
market because that you know soon as you

864
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:43,269
allow interstate traffic it will totally

865
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,880
remake the face of the industry yet

866
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:48,369
again oh absolutely i mean when you

867
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,840
think about the wine industry and

868
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:52,959
especially the fact that we're going to

869
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,549
have Appalachians for cannabis folks in

870
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,279
other states are going to want to get

871
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:58,569
cannabis from certain Appalachians and

872
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,339
so we're really going to see a

873
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,079
difference once we start to do

874
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:04,329
interstate commerce and i really feel

875
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,419
that at that point the indoor market

876
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:09,250
will really start to dwindle of course

877
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,889
we also have a whole generation of

878
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,510
people coming off of prohibition when

879
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:15,668
nobody really knows what cannabis is

880
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,040
supposed to look like we all have our

881
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:20,079
ideas from High Times about what buds

882
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,940
are supposed to look like when I was

883
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,429
working at birthday patients group I

884
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,398
used to call that bag appeal because you

885
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:29,349
would have Sun grown cannabis that cost

886
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:32,079
two-thirds the price and tested at the

887
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:34,210
same level of THC yet people would still

888
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,909
gravitate towards these indoor buds

889
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,980
because they look tighter you know they

890
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:41,200
looked different and so people were

891
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,909
associating that with quality I think

892
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,529
that's going to change and people are

893
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:46,960
going to associate quality with things

894
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:49,030
like being pesticide-free being grown

895
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,329
outdoors being grown organically and

896
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:54,280
being grown in a specific appellation we

897
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:56,860
can already see that happening at a at a

898
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,980
brand strategy level with folks who are

899
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:01,550
using greenhouses not calling it outdoor

900
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,800
because outdoors kind of got that

901
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,230
reputation of you know i hit and grow

902
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:12,320
somewhere that's been done cheap and

903
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:14,420
fast vs. Sun grown or or similar words

904
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,100
which suggests that okay yeah it's

905
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,690
what's grown under the Sun but it

906
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:20,059
doesn't mean that it's not done without

907
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,470
exceptionally high quality growing

908
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:24,170
technique and you know you mentioned

909
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:26,000
pesticide and the other legalizing

910
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,829
states have had a lot of challenges with

911
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,840
that you know going to market with

912
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:33,019
flowers that we eventually found out

913
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,180
we're rife with pesticides does the new

914
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:38,509
regulatory structure in California is

915
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:40,609
that pre-baked in that pesticide testing

916
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,110
will take place or is or is the part of

917
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,539
the particulars for that still to be

918
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:47,860
evolved I know that's baked in so

919
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:51,739
testing for both potency and purity

920
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:53,900
right on so now we just need to get more

921
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:55,639
labs up and running but I guess I guess

922
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,010
also that's it that's an assumption that

923
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:00,949
doesn't necessarily play for California

924
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:03,620
because since you already have labs for

925
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:05,589
testing in the medical market a lot of

926
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,389
them will just be expanding more I guess

927
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,010
absolutely i mean most of the reputable

928
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:13,039
dispensaries have been testing their

929
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:15,500
product for several years now so and in

930
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,150
all of the big commercial edible and

931
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,179
other product companies have their

932
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,530
products tested as well so again you

933
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,659
know we've at one thing that's really

934
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,400
interesting is that when you look at the

935
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:27,349
evolution of the cannabis industry in

936
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,200
California and I started studying it

937
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:31,880
back in 2002 when you would walk into a

938
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,259
dispensary and you had to get a brownie

939
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,809
it was basically just wrapped in

940
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,910
cellophane someone made it at home and

941
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:39,769
brought it in and you had no idea how

942
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:42,049
strong it was or what the ingredients

943
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:44,509
were or if brownie a was going to be a

944
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,610
lot different than brownie be and then

945
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,190
you know looking just 10-15 years later

946
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:51,500
the sophistication in the packaging and

947
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:54,050
the testing nobody mandated that

948
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,840
companies did that that was all self

949
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:59,750
regulation by the industry in response

950
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,880
to patients wanting to know what was in

951
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,550
their products and I think that as much

952
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,890
flack as the cannabis industry gets for

953
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,350
just caring about money and it's the Big

954
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:12,230
Green Rush the folks that started this

955
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:14,059
industry they really cared about their

956
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,219
patients and about what they were giving

957
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:17,320
consumers and

958
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:19,419
they didn't we wouldn't see them taking

959
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,970
the steps to do packaging and labeling

960
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,430
and testing before the state absolutely

961
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:26,858
mandated it you know that's there's

962
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:30,098
reasons why the cannabis probiotic

963
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:32,079
growing movement homeland is the Emerald

964
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:35,200
triangle you know the growers there

965
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,730
early on for medical they were very they

966
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,289
had a lot of concern about what was

967
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,699
going into their patients because it was

968
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:42,608
a labor of love for them and it's great

969
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:44,500
that that that kind of a headspace is is

970
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:47,108
at the front of the new commercial

971
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,670
market as well you know I'm and up you

972
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:49,989
know there's one thing I want to ask you

973
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,358
because you know a lot of folks that are

974
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:54,219
listening they may be moving towards

975
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:56,259
cannabis and a lot of them may be new to

976
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:57,759
the industry they're going to bring

977
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,550
their their skill set from another

978
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,560
industry over into cannabis either with

979
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,910
a license or without and a lot of those

980
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,309
folks are going to run into a situation

981
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:09,368
like folks did in other states where

982
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:12,429
they want to hire a consultant to help

983
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:15,608
them bridge from their present industry

984
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:17,549
experience to cannabis and there have

985
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:20,230
been so many horror stories of

986
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,810
consultants from other states and folks

987
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:26,108
getting swindled I just like to you know

988
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:29,409
give you an opportunity to to share some

989
00:38:26,108 --> 00:38:30,969
of your experience of what entrepreneurs

990
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:33,190
might want to think about when vetting

991
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:34,868
their consultants to to hope that they

992
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,059
can choose one that's going to really be

993
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:39,510
to their benefit well you're absolutely

994
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:41,529
right i mean everybody is a consult

995
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,960
everybody's been in the business forever

996
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,910
you know it's getting really crazy out

997
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,550
there so I mean be doing due diligence

998
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:49,929
is very important just because somebody

999
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,310
seems like they have their [ __ ] together

1000
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:52,779
does not mean they have their [ __ ]

1001
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:54,730
together because there's a lot of money

1002
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,619
that you can pay people to make it look

1003
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,900
like you have your [ __ ] together yeah so

1004
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:00,400
you want to really ask them you know how

1005
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,039
long have you really been doing this

1006
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,410
where did you get your start you know

1007
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,539
what companies have you worked with if

1008
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:10,420
you have somebody that's been doing this

1009
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:13,119
for less than five years I would say

1010
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,639
don't do it because the industry has

1011
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,500
changed a lot by not having the

1012
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:20,379
knowledge of where it was ten years ago

1013
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,980
is really not going to play well for you

1014
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,660
as a new business person and then all

1015
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,000
so I would make sure that whoever you

1016
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:30,779
hire has a working knowledge of

1017
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,329
government how policies are made how

1018
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,970
bills are passed in the legislature has

1019
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,429
some kind of experience with lobbying or

1020
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:39,539
knowledge about how policy works because

1021
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:42,000
this is different than any other

1022
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:44,519
industry and that the policies that are

1023
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,949
passed will absolutely impact your

1024
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:48,329
ability to succeed and if you don't have

1025
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:50,969
someone that has a lot of knowledge

1026
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:53,130
that's willing to go to Sacramento you

1027
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:55,379
know a few times a week to really stay

1028
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,910
on top of the hundreds of marijuana

1029
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,980
bills that are going to come down the

1030
00:39:56,909 --> 00:40:01,679
pike this year you're not doing yourself

1031
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,300
a service by hiring them so you know you

1032
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,039
have to have somebody that's political

1033
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,289
and you also have to have somebody that

1034
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,750
has a working knowledge of where this

1035
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:11,039
movement has come from you know recently

1036
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,530
we had this marijuana business

1037
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,389
conference in Las Vegas and a friend of

1038
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,880
mine was there representing students for

1039
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:20,190
sensible drug policy and she said that

1040
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,579
three people asked her what the drug war

1041
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:25,380
was Wow and I would say if that's you

1042
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,869
and you're out there going what is the

1043
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,390
drug war just stop just go turn around

1044
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:32,220
walk away from the industry because

1045
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:35,159
honestly you're doing us more harm than

1046
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:36,919
good well that's a great segue to my

1047
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:39,059
next question was going to be you know

1048
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,730
cannabis entrepreneurs have got to be

1049
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:44,759
active learners probably as much or more

1050
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:47,579
than just about any other industry but

1051
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,010
we also know that there's so much poor

1052
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:52,500
information online when you're trying to

1053
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,700
do your research now specifically for

1054
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,599
California I'm going to ask you a

1055
00:40:53,699 --> 00:41:00,389
two-part question number one where can

1056
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,539
clean information about what's going on

1057
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:06,809
in the legislature and with the

1058
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:10,139
regulatory groups be found online for

1059
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:12,269
California and then second do you have

1060
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,559
any other sources for information for

1061
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,960
entrepreneurs that you would recommend

1062
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:18,299
they go to instead of just blindly

1063
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,880
googling whatever their question is yes

1064
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,180
never blindly Google anything that's I

1065
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,800
think is a good lesson for people so the

1066
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:28,349
National cannabis Industry Association

1067
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,480
which has a chapter in California the

1068
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:32,429
California cannabis industry association

1069
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,750
I would really recommend checking them

1070
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,519
out you know

1071
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,590
they have really stay on top of things

1072
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,960
that are happening in Sacramento and at

1073
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:41,370
the federal level they have lobbyists

1074
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,949
they have a wide variety of companies

1075
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:47,369
that they represent they have caucuses

1076
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:49,679
that our industry specific so caucuses

1077
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:52,440
for manufacturers versus distributors

1078
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,879
versus cultivators and so you know I

1079
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,920
think that's a really good way to stay

1080
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,260
on top of things also the bureau of

1081
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,510
marijuana regulation their website at

1082
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,520
the state level will have updates on

1083
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:04,230
bills that have been introduced and they

1084
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:06,599
also have been doing these town halls

1085
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,099
across the state for different sectors

1086
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,259
of the industry where they want to hear

1087
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,789
feedback from people that want to get

1088
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,710
involved in kind of what their concerns

1089
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:16,920
are so I would definitely recommend

1090
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:18,570
doing those things and then there are

1091
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,590
some great incubators and accelerators

1092
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:24,900
out there one in particular is canopy so

1093
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:27,329
canopy started out in boulder and they

1094
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,610
just opened offices in Berkeley and also

1095
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:31,980
down in San Diego and they are an

1096
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:34,260
accelerator specifically for companies

1097
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,820
that do not touch the plant so the

1098
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,730
companies that we're talking about the

1099
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:41,190
ancillary services the software the

1100
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:43,440
streamlining they're the ones that would

1101
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,119
support those kinds of businesses so if

1102
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,550
you're in California you know I would

1103
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,409
check them out because they have classes

1104
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,990
and they have opportunities for people

1105
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:55,079
to join their programs to help grow

1106
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:57,689
their businesses fantastic fantastic and

1107
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,519
you know Amanda before we say goodbye

1108
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,440
here there's one thing I wanted to hit

1109
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,960
on that's actually happening there in

1110
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,700
your locale there in Oakland that I

1111
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,289
think is interesting to point out you

1112
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:11,569
know I've read a couple articles about

1113
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:16,460
the the ideas of reparations for at-risk

1114
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:16,460
minority communities that have been

1115
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:23,339
unbalanced Lee a hit with the drug war

1116
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:27,090
and and I believe it's the City of

1117
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:30,930
Oakland has actually is giving deference

1118
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:32,730
to licenses to folks that have are from

1119
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:34,079
these minority groups i'm obviously not

1120
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,400
explaining it very well but that's what

1121
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,519
I'd like you to do could you explain

1122
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,130
that policy sure so here in California

1123
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,320
we have a law at the state level against

1124
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,640
affirmative action meaning that we're

1125
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,710
not

1126
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:47,869
allowed to do set asides for women and

1127
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,849
minority-owned businesses so some

1128
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:52,880
localities like Oakland have trying to

1129
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:54,799
figure out what is a proxy for that so

1130
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,630
that we can make sure that those that

1131
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,480
have been most impacted by the drug war

1132
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,400
have as many if not more opportunities

1133
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,340
to get involved in this new regulated

1134
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,980
industry than others do so here in

1135
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:10,190
Oakland the idea was put forth to set

1136
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,170
aside half of the licenses for cannabis

1137
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:14,300
businesses for people that have been

1138
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,670
negatively impacted by the drug war

1139
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,920
either because they live in a part of

1140
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:21,200
the city that is heavily policed for

1141
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,690
drugs or they themselves have been

1142
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,909
incarcerated in Oakland for marijuana

1143
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,909
related offense within the past I think

1144
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:31,519
ten years or five years so that was the

1145
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:33,469
original plan it's been a bit

1146
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,530
controversial not because of its

1147
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:38,329
intention so there are no people that

1148
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:40,460
think this is a bad idea i mean people

1149
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:41,779
agree that and recognize that there have

1150
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,090
been communities that have been more

1151
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,760
impacted by marijuana prohibition and

1152
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:49,789
others however there's been a bit of a

1153
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,980
political fight over who exactly should

1154
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:54,940
be included in this equity program and

1155
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:59,690
one of the city council members has

1156
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:03,110
really derailed the process with really

1157
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,610
quite crazy demands such as current

1158
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,230
marijuana businesses have to give

1159
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:09,099
twenty-five percent of their revenue

1160
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:11,269
including retro actively to the city

1161
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:13,309
just things that are really making it

1162
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:15,619
difficult to move forward with this plan

1163
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:18,920
so right now we're looking at

1164
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:21,199
alternatives including you know opening

1165
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,980
up the number of police beats that

1166
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:26,779
people can qualify for the plan making

1167
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,150
it so it's not just a marijuana

1168
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:32,120
incarceration in Oakland but anywhere in

1169
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:34,460
California and so right now we're going

1170
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,279
back and forth with the city about what

1171
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,559
exactly this plan will look like

1172
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,350
unfortunately it's putting Oakland

1173
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:44,719
behind our other neighboring cities in

1174
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,849
terms of their licensing and regulations

1175
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:49,699
around cannabis and this is concerning

1176
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:51,440
because Oakland has always been kind of

1177
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:54,559
on the forefront of cannabis regulation

1178
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,150
and I think that for um they've kind of

1179
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,610
been sitting on their laurels like oh

1180
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,650
well

1181
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:00,599
one's always out in front so we can take

1182
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:03,090
as much time as we want because no one

1183
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,489
else is going to do this licensing but

1184
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:07,950
they're wrong and surrounding cities

1185
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:09,989
have started licensing what Oakland

1186
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:12,059
wants to do and so we're seeing

1187
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:14,489
businesses unfortunately start to leave

1188
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:17,009
the city of oakland to seek licenses and

1189
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:20,399
other localities so we definitely

1190
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:22,140
support the idea of helping people that

1191
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,539
have been most impacted get into the

1192
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:26,519
industry but we have to do it in a way

1193
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:28,710
that makes sense and in a way that will

1194
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,079
maintain oakland as a competitive city

1195
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:33,740
in the cannabis industry for decades to

1196
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:36,630
come wow that's a really interesting

1197
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:39,359
situation talk about competing goods I

1198
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,190
mean you not only are you trying to help

1199
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,070
these minority communities that have

1200
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:46,409
been impacted at the same time at a city

1201
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:49,019
level you need to be able to protect

1202
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:51,210
Oakland as a business entity and make

1203
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:53,610
sure that these companies decide to set

1204
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,409
up shop there well well we'll be very

1205
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:58,700
interested to check back in with you on

1206
00:46:55,409 --> 00:47:02,460
that down the line as the regulatory

1207
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:03,509
structure around all of this evolves so

1208
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,190
I think that's we're going to stop for

1209
