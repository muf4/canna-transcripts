2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,199
for as long as humans have been farming

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,039
farmers have had a relationship with the

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,239
land that is intimate

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,079
mutually giving and high stakes farmers

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,399
learn about their land by looking at it

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,719
and comparing it to other seasons

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,079
they can touch the soil and trees and

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,118
fruit and mud

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:29,198
and learn about its health the sounds of

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,079
the wind through the grasses and the

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,359
bird song

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:36,320
tell their own stories and even tasting

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,320
physically tasting the soil and water

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,200
tells an attuned farmer

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,719
something about its makeup ever since

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,480
humans started farming

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,558
families in small communities have

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,398
literally had their lives dependent on

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,959
the crops that were grown

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,920
a failed season could be financial ruin

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,878
and perhaps starvation and death

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,079
similarly a successful season meant more

24
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,479
for everyone

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,799
paid off debts and the joy that comes

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,118
with physical security

27
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,239
all of this human meaning coming from a

28
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,319
farmer's relationship with the land

29
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,438
during prohibition cannabis farmers had

30
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,919
to know their land

31
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,399
and pray about the weather too and they

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
had the added threat of law enforcement

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
and helicopters

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
trying to provide for my family by

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,079
growing fields of cannabis while

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,478
avoiding the dea

37
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,560
and national guard overhead has got to

38
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,078
be one of the most stressful jobs i can

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,400
imagine

40
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,559
but at its heart farming always comes

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,040
back to the land and the weather

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
that essential relationship that give

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
and take

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,479
demands and openness from the farmer and

45
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,239
a willingness to do what the land wants

46
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,280
to keep her in balance and

47
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,599
fertile as cannabis enthusiasts

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,478
we can all benefit from remembering that

49
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,599
cannabis

50
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,640
is flowers and that flowers come from

51
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,199
the earth

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,478
and these flowers connect us to the

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,680
efforts of farmers

54
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,359
everywhere and so we are all connected

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,560
to their land

56
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,758
their homes their families and our

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,199
shared earth

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,639

nick is a highly sought after speaker

108
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,280
but he's hard to get because they live

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,239
so far up the mountain and are nearly

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,719
off grid

111
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
that said nick has spoken at emerald cup

events today we're going to discuss

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,080
suggestions for

115
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,759
putting your garden to rest in the fall

116
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,239
opportunities for improvement over the

117
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,239
winter

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,759
and some best practices for waking your

119
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,878
farm up in the spring

120
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,639
welcome to the show nicholas hey shango

121
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,079

122
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,519

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,239
with you ever since we recorded that

124
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
great

125
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,719
video um at your farm and i'm so

126
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,560
grateful for finally getting to it so

127
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
thanks for making time in your busy

128
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
schedule especially uh you know so early

129
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
in the morning today

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
so let's get right into it you know at

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,439
the end of the season

132
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,800
so many of us just want to walk away

133
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,639
from the garden right because we're

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,120
tired and we're ready for a break

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,439
but fall is a really great opportunity

136
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,280
for gains in a garden that's integrated

137
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,600
with the nature that's surrounding it

138
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,758
so so let's start there in the fall so

139
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
i'm sure as you are harvesting plants

140
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,040
you're already planning

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,639
what you're gonna do as soon as

142
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,199
everything is hung so

143
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,160
will you walk us along your process for

144
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,600
putting the garden to rest for the fall

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,720
sure um first of all it starts

146
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,840
it starts basically in august and and

147
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,000
so it actually begins before harvest um

148
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,519
and it's kind of a preparation for

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
harvest is

150
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:17,359
kind of uh it's

151
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
preparing for harvest is the beginning

152
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,400
process

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,199
of getting ready for the winter and the

154
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,638
way that

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,919
um i look at this is is

156
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
when people are when we're out

157
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,120
harvesting uh these plants

158
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,120
we're stepping on the soil around the

159
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,319
plants a lot so the first step

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,560
that i'm taking that we're taking is

161
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,240
is mulching around the plants really

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
heavy with wood chips and there's a

163
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,319
reason that we use

164
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,319
wood chips um wood chips are kind of the

165
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,399
most uh

166
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:53,599
resilient and soil

167
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,359
protector if you will um so when you

168
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,280
actually put wood chips on the ground

169
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,080
and then walk on those wood chips

170
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,119
it prevents compaction and it also

171
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,758
prepares the

172
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,879
the surface of the of the ground for the

173
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,080
winter rains and

174
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,120
and the ability to infiltrate water

175
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,959
into the ground as well as once it

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,439
starts to get wet again

177
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,239
um all the microbiology that's that's

178
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,079
kind of

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,680
maybe hidden down in the soil a little

180
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,719
deeper in the late summer

181
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,038
because of the dryness is able to

182
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,759
work its way back up to the surface and

183
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:30,560
beyond into the new mulch layer

184
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,720
so so you know really if you want to

185
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,478
have your garden really well prepared

186
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,960
for winter you start in the summer and

187
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,839
you know i can't i i can't emphasize

188
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,279
enough

189
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,478
that people start their they think about

190
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,478
their care

191
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,000
pre-emptively before the season

192
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,560
everybody wants to get away or

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,439
like finish a season and is it's really

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,959
you know like

195
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:57,279
a big time of the year to want to

196
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,719
stop doing anything because all the the

197
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,519
work that's gone into the season but

198
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,759
really

199
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,519
in order to uh really do a good job you

200
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,598
have to think about

201
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,120
the soil you have to think about the

202
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,560
weather that's coming you have to think

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
about the weather that exists now you

204
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
have to think about what happened all

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
summer

206
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,159
and and one thing that happens in the

207
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,478
summer in a garden space that's

208
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,840
irrigated is a lot of microbiology eats

209
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,478
a lot of the carbon

210
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,399
mulch that is available and therefore

211
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,399
once that mulch is broken down into more

212
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,918
of a humus it becomes more capable of

213
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,318
being compacted

214
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,519
and that's that's exactly why you know

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
you really want to like

216
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,799
put all that heavy wood chip around your

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,879
plants before your workers are out there

218
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
harvesting on those plants so that their

219
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,079
footsteps aren't actually doing damage

220
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,199
to the

221
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,519
uh to the soil layer below so

222
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
yeah that's that's the beginning process

223
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,159
when you are

224
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,478
placing the wood chips um how

225
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
um how far out from the plants are you

226
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,079
going are you are you putting them more

227
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,799
at the base because you're

228
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,800
just trying to protect the the eight or

229
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,520
ten inches on either side

230
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,160
of the stock or are you all like no no

231
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,839
no no

232
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,599
we heavily do the entire bed so that

233
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,598
um so that it's more

234
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,719
liberally protected or do you go so far

235
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,918
as to wood chip

236
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,199
the isle ways between the plants too

237
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,159
because i know you see your soil as

238
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,199
being kind of

239
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,319
one one comprehensive organism

240
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,479
instead of like discrete parts yeah it's

241
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,399
it's a it's all dependent on the

242
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,360
resource availability how many wood

243
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,639
chips do you have

244
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,918
how much mulch availability do you have

245
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,838
um and if you can do the whole bed

246
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,278
and the pathway that's ideal and the

247
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,959
more you can put on

248
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,720
that time of the year the better because

249
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,759
what you're looking at doing

250
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,278
is um you know the the benefits of the

251
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,039
wood chips at that time of the year

252
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,958
are numerous and and preparing for

253
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,439
we have to think about things in terms

254
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,799
of climate so i'm in southern oregon

255
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,279
and i'm thinking about the winter and

256
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,159
and the winter in southern oregon is the

257
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,919
wet season

258
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,838
and therefore there's all this leaching

259
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,679
that goes on in that season

260
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,920
it's different where it freezes really

261
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,519
hard and the ground's frozen all

262
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,599
all winter so a lot less happens in that

263
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
scenario but really the soil wakes up in

264
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,080
southern

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
oregon in the fall when it starts to get

266
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
wet again and all that microbiology has

267
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,200
that moisture to be able to

268
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,919
um to to start to do its work again and

269
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,120
so

270
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,759
um you know the wood chips are

271
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,440
a preparation to support the fungal

272
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,159
growth for the wintertime

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
and the fungal component and the hyphae

274
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,000
and

275
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,360
and the mycelium that uh basically

276
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,159
covers the the soil when you wood chip

277
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
heavy

278
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,838
is the protectant layer that prevents

279
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,199
leaching

280
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,440
so the fungal the the way the fungus

281
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,759
works is the mycelium encases

282
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
all the organic matter and now when you

283
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,439
run water through it

284
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,278
the water doesn't carry anything away

285
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
the the fungal component

286
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,278
actually acts as a filter and so this is

287
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,519
a way to keep the water clean and to

288
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,600
prevent leaching from occurring

289
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
it's not the only way to do it and if

290
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,278
you have access to a lot of wood chips i

291
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,039
live in a forested area where there

292
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,639
needs to be massive amounts of thinning

293
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,120
going on anyway so we

294
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,278
generally are able to find access to

295
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,039
good wood chips

296
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,958
but in a case where say your fertility

297
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,719
is already really on point you're in

298
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,399
some agricultural lands

299
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,320
you know you might choose the direction

300
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
of just straight cover crop in the

301
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,399
winter where

302
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,879
the the root systems are acting as the

303
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,278
nutrient uptake and the protector of the

304
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,240
soil but in in the case where i

305
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,559
i am uh our fertility is not very high

306
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
we

307
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,119
we live in the mountains and on gravely

308
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
serpentine soil so

309
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
you know what i'm really doing still

310
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,679
even at year five is is i want to

311
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,600
promote the development of humus

312
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,599
and and and continue building fertility

313
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,159
uh for years before i get to the point

314
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,800
where say i was down in the the valley

315
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,278
bottom

316
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,078
and all the silts get carried down um

317
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,399
and and there

318
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,239
it's an endless depth of of really

319
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,320
nutrient-rich soil so

320
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
you know in my case i am wood chipping

321
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
heavy for

322
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,920
many different reasons but a lot of it

323
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,919
is prevention of compaction

324
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,479
and feeding the soil life and

325
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:34,000
particularly the fungus we're actually

326
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,240
aiming to acidify uh a little bit

327
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,120
we're looking at acidic more acidic in

328
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,919
the winter

329
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,039
and and more bacterial in the in the

330
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,360
summer but

331
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,199
you know ultimately there's always both

332
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,399
the bacteria

333
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,920
or the alkaline and and acidic

334
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,600
i guess the two different things and the

335
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,240
way that we can think about that is

336
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,000
fungal uh fungally dominant soils

337
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,799
support more acidic soils

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,639
and bacterially dominated soils support

339
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,159
more alkaline soils so

340
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,000
we're trying to support a more acidic

341
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,379
soil in the winter and then we balance

342
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,919
that in the spring with the manures

343
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:11,600
[Music]

344
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:14,639
for the for the growth of the crop um

345
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,720
right on so um my question about

346
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,560
wood chips would be you know when i was

347
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,600
at your property

348
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,879
your property has got more wood chips

349
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,040
than i've ever seen

350
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,078
on a cannabis farm actually on any farm

351
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,240
period

352
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,278
and i know that most of your stuff comes

353
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,079
from your

354
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,360
the forest around you but you were clear

355
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,838
earlier when you said

356
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
you know if you have access to good

357
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,480
chips

358
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,560
so you know in in some ways you're

359
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,639
probably like a chip guru you know

360
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,838
so so teach us a little bit about wood

361
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,079
chips and for

362
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,839
and sourcing and choosing the kind of

363
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,799
chip we're gonna use

364
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,639
well the good thing about wood chips is

365
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,799
they're generally coming from tree

366
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,120
companies who are doing either road work

367
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,319
or

368
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,839
homework and you know people don't spray

369
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,839
their trees very often so

370
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,519
oftentimes wood chips are actually

371
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,240
pretty clean in comparison to other

372
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
things

373
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
if you're working with people who are

374
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
doing a bunch of landscaping stuff on

375
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,319
really

376
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,079
uh you know uh managed landscapes you

377
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,959
then you have to be concerned about what

378
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,638
people are

379
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,319
are managing the landscapes with in

380
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,799
terms of chemicals and stuff

381
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,320
but you know in the case of gathering

382
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,958
from tree services who are

383
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
are working on roads and stuff those

384
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,278
wood chips are great um

385
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,399
and i highly recommend people search out

386
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,240
their tree companies

387
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,320
and utilize those wood chips that way

388
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,440
because otherwise they're oftentimes

389
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,160
just being

390
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,920
not not used well they're they're being

391
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,559
taken away from the site in which they

392
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,319
grew

393
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,759
and they're being dumped in a place and

394
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
all heat together

395
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,159
and it's just not an efficient way to

396
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,800
maximize our carbon

397
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,198
so you know there's a lot of energy and

398
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,838
and

399
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,519
and and gasoline and all the stuff that

400
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,040
goes into even chipping wood

401
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,039
so you know i personally am not even

402
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,519
chipping that much wood off my own land

403
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,838
i'm just

404
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,360
accessing the wood chips that's already

405
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,720
been processed

406
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,240
in in these cert or these systems that

407
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,399
exist that maybe aren't the most

408
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
efficient in terms of gas but

409
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
they exist and so we have to intercept

410
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,399
these

411
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,600
these uh these carbon streams that are

412
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,720
being wasted

413
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,399
and and put them back into good use and

414
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,079
and you know honestly wood chips are

415
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,879
probably the cheapest

416
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,278
most valuable input that you could ever

417
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,838
put

418
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,679
on your garden so in terms of what a

419
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,760
good wood chip is like everybody's

420
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,879
always concerned i get the question a

421
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,039
lot about

422
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,360
what type of wood chips do you want to

423
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,719
use and what type of trees are

424
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,278
okay to use and you know my my general

425
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,120
answer

426
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,360
for most of these things is they're all

427
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,839
good um

428
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
but they're best when they're they're

429
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,839
diverse

430
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:58,479
so you know people are like well the

431
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,519
evergreen trees are too acidic and and

432
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
all this and

433
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,600
there's some truth to that there's

434
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,519
different chemistry and different trees

435
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,600
while they're living but as they're

436
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,240
dying and being consumed

437
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,159
back into the soil they lose that

438
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,079
chemistry and so even the things that

439
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,719
are say aleopathic

440
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,159
walnut trees and pecans or these kinds

441
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,079
of things that prevent things from

442
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,519
growing doesn't mean that the wood chip

443
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,120
breakdown is going to prevent things

444
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,159
from growing as well

445
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,360
so just understand like old if you've

446
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,039
got wood chips that have been sitting

447
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,399
around for a couple of years it doesn't

448
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,399
matter what kind they are

449
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,399
um you know there is some truth to

450
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,240
redwoods prevent fungal growth cedar

451
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,879
prevents some fungal growth

452
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,480
that's true and if all you have is all

453
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,639
redwood chips are all

454
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,920
cedar chips you might just put those on

455
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,919
the pathway and know that they're going

456
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,639
to take a little longer

457
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,360
and not support a certain component of

458
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,680
your soil

459
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,079
as much as say like an oak tree or a

460
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:57,439
maple tree or an alder tree

461
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:01,278
deciduous trees in general might support

462
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,399
a quicker saprophytic fungal breakdown

463
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:07,120
process so

464
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,480
diversity is always the aim you're

465
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,639
always looking for

466
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,879
you don't want the best you know if you

467
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,639
wanted the best you would eliminate

468
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,240
all the rest and then you would be down

469
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,320
this path of monoculture

470
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,079
and that's the issue that i think this

471
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,519
culture faces is we're always trying to

472
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,758
get the most efficient

473
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,120
best thing that we can because we care

474
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,440
so much about

475
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,560
having the best and and that kind of

476
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
mentality is

477
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,239
is the one that takes you down this

478
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,039
narrow path of problems

479
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,959
um because now you're eliminating the

480
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,759
diversity in the system

481
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,278
and you're subjecting yourself to a

482
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,560
really one-sided

483
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,559
imbalanced scenario so a bunch

484
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,799
it's all good it's all carbon it doesn't

485
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,440
even have to be from trees

486
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,799
you know everything breaks down the same

487
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,800
everything

488
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,919
there there's no carbon that's better

489
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,399
than other carbon

490
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,919
essentially right on you know i really

491
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,480
appreciate you nick you know this every

492
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,720
time i

493
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,679
hear you speak whether it was the video

494
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,318
we did together

495
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,559
or or seeing you at emerald cup you have

496
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,678
this wonderful way of taking what goes

497
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,240
on on your garden

498
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,280
and tying it seamlessly into the systems

499
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
around you right

500
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,480
like you took that question and next

501
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,880
thing you know you're talking about

502
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,038
uh carbon streams that happen off of

503
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
your property and how to maximize them

504
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,160
for the good of the earth

505
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,919
and you know and then suddenly you're

506
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,679
like all the way back over here talking

507
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,799
about uh you know different seasonal

508
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,880
soil types

509
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,279
all while talking about what makes a

510
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,320
good wood chip and and i appreciate that

511
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,918
that holistic

512
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,159
um the headspace of yours so so

513
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,919
so when i originally asked the question

514
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,519
i said you know what are you doing

515
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,240
starting at harvest and you're like well

516
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,319
actually django we start pre-harvest so

517
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,480
our and then we talked a lot about wood

518
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,960
chipping so is there anything else that

519
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,798
you do

520
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,079
pre-harvest that we want to make sure

521
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,279
that we catch on

522
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:01,279
before we go to the next time block

523
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,160
which will be after harvest

524
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,240
sure pre-harvest you know it's a good

525
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,720
time to gather up the potatoes that are

526
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,000
growing

527
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,558
under and around um and just

528
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,200
to kind of either to to store them for

529
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,759
eating

530
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,440
and or to just break up the clumps of in

531
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,279
groups of potatoes and spread them out

532
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,360
before the mulching

533
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,558
so you can kind of replant your potatoes

534
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,038
at that time

535
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,798
by by harvesting and spreading them out

536
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,240
if you want them to grow big again

537
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:33,839
if you leave most tubers and stuff they

538
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
they form multiple many uh at the base

539
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,720
of

540
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,880
of where they grow and if you don't

541
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,440
harvest and spread them out they they

542
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,360
end up becoming smaller and smaller as

543
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,519
the years progress you may have many

544
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,439
more but they're just the the production

545
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,720
is is sacrificed a little bit and they

546
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,120
get overcrowded

547
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,000
like most things and and you know you

548
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,359
just don't see those

549
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,960
giant big potatoes if you don't take the

550
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,038
time to

551
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,160
take those potatoes out and and spread

552
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,359
them about so

553
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
you know if you're going to be spending

554
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,159
a bunch of time pushing a bunch of wood

555
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,079
chips onto the scene

556
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,080
pull your potatoes out first spread them

557
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,558
out and mulch over those potatoes i

558
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,558
don't

559
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,720
ever do anything very systematically

560
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,119
like i'm not making a line of potatoes

561
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,440
or

562
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,639
i'm literally pulling them out pulling

563
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,160
the ones i want to eat

564
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,000
and then the ones that are scarred or

565
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,120
eaten by bugs to some degree i'm just

566
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,919
tossing

567
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,038
into the area i'm not really even trying

568
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,840
to place them

569
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,240
anywhere in particular so spreading some

570
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,918
of the

571
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,240
the food crops out the tubers um

572
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,919
that that might be one thing uh that's

573
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,880
really helpful right before the mulching

574
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,080
applications

575
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,919
uh you know uh so yeah you know it's a

576
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,359
good time to throw cover crop seed on

577
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,160
the areas that aren't gonna be as

578
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,399
mulched

579
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,440
uh so if you if you have some extra seed

580
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,679
laying around or

581
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,080
you know it's also a good time to look

582
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,679
at what has seeded itself in the garden

583
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,439
and if you want that stuff to grow in

584
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,120
different places to cut that down and

585
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,160
just lay it where you want it to grow

586
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:04,639
and and and that'll kind of increase

587
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:08,640
your desired uh cover crop potential

588
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,759
um so right on so so i know you to be a

589
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,080
huge fan of having potatoes under your

590
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,519
plants for a couple reasons

591
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,720
for folks who haven't heard you talk

592
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,480
about this why don't you hit on that

593
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,839
briefly before we move on because

594
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,558
it's interesting and it's something kind

595
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,558
of unique to your farm yeah well

596
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,759
i mean potatoes have fed the world for

597
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,759
so long that it's

598
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,679
it's a worthy crop to pay attention to

599
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,558
uh it's also a tuber

600
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,240
and tubers are doing great things for

601
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,480
the soil they're not feeding just

602
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,159
us i mean because they feed us these

603
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,400
these important starches and they give

604
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,679
us

605
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,080
a a bank of food that you can basically

606
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,440
source

607
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,079
all year long it's also feeding the soil

608
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
life so

609
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,678
leaving a bunch of potatoes in the

610
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,880
ground it explodes your

611
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,640
arthropod populations i've i can't tell

612
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,159
you how many times i pulled up a

613
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,038
rotten potato that was just heaving with

614
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,159
with millipede life like an explosion of

615
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,400
of certain

616
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,679
you know uh biology that that's

617
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,640
important and so

618
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,840
i look at it at the potato and it's not

619
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
just potatoes uh

620
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,759
tubers in general but potatoes just

621
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,719
generally seem to do really good in our

622
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,599
our growing scenarios i can't help but

623
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
think that's

624
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,839
that's aiding and helping the cannabis

625
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,558
as well so potatoes have been one of our

626
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:29,038
favorite companion plants with cannabis

627
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:32,158
um since for for many many years once i

628
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,000
started honing in on that i i just

629
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,600
understanding potatoes is is an

630
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,720
important piece of

631
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,319
of having a secure food system i guess

632
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,880
you know it's like when it comes down to

633
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,720
it

634
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,080
i eat more potatoes out of the garden

635
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,120
than any other crop

636
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,918
so i consider it very valuable and a way

637
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,798
to

638
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,360
make sure that i'm gonna get through the

639
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:53,279
winter

640
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,759
if all the stores close down kind of

641
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,639
thing yeah it's a real dual use thing

642
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,879
isn't it right

643
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,600
you can eat them whenever you want but

644
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,039
but also they're

645
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,279
while being respectful to the food

646
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,798
they're also not precious right you can

647
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,440
also put them

648
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,599
you know in the ground to rot as well

649
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,080
and they are doing an entirely different

650
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,079
precious job not being food at that

651
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,199
point because there being food for

652
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,199
all of the complex

653
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,279
living things that are in your garden

654
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,158
and one of the things that i like about

655
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,079
potatoes too

656
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,440
is that it is nutrition that's

657
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,879
accessible

658
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,000
to multiple levels of magnitude

659
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,280
in your bed it doesn't just feed

660
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,359
one level of magnitude um when it's

661
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,119
whole it feeds one group of insects and

662
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,558
then as it breaks down

663
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,279
it feeds all the way down to the

664
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:48,319
microbiology and um

665
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:51,038
and it's got so much nutritional value

666
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,558
it just seems to make the entire bed

667
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,480
more abundant

668
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,839
yeah i mean it's it's an amazing thing

669
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,839
and in the spring when you leave the

670
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,519
potatoes in or they've over wintered and

671
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,839
they start growing super early and they

672
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,480
freeze back and then they grow multi-top

673
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,798
they become an amazing cover crop where

674
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,120
i'm actually having to destroy a lot of

675
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,279
vines when i'm transplanting things in

676
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,359
because there's just potatoes everywhere

677
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,399
and that's a good situation to be in you

678
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,678
know because

679
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
you know i don't have to worry about how

680
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,640
many potatoes i'm going to grow i've got

681
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
thousands of pounds in the ground i

682
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,159
don't ever harvest them all

683
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,159
but in the spring i've got this

684
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,360
beautiful uh

685
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,559
cover crop uh vining

686
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:33,918
green and potatoes three four feet

687
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:36,960
tall and five feet bush like by

688
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,000
june so i can harvest potatoes from june

689
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,278
until

690
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,319
uh through the winter so it's really a

691
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,919
i i can't i can't recommend potatoes

692
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,639
enough i mean they're the best

693
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,278
uh they're the best food crop that i

694
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,840
know of

695
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,440
um in terms of they don't eat that much

696
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,000
in the soil you know they're they're

697
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,679
amazing

698
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,839
it's interesting to me to hear you talk

699
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,600
about potatoes as a cover crop because

700
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,558
you know i grew up in detroit

701
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,079
and um yeah you know i think of potatoes

702
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,038
as something that's under the soil

703
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,119
but you're like no man in the in by june

704
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,119
they have grown up out of the soil and

705
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,038
you've got these green tops

706
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,038
and they're producing all these other

707
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,519
benefits that we normally

708
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,240
you know just give to radishes yeah

709
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,359
exactly

710
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,519
and and honestly they're they're

711
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,119
they cover the ground and when you say

712
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,440
cover crop that's what you're looking

713
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,278
for

714
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,480
is something that is acting as a living

715
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,038
mulch layer

716
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,880
uh that protects the soil and and the

717
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,038
rhizosphere so

718
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,039
you know again but the potatoes don't

719
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,960
grow the same way if you pull them all

720
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:39,599
out and plant them individually they're

721
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,519
much

722
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,038
they're just not as vigorous and not as

723
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,359
bush and cover like

724
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,319
so you really have to like exercise this

725
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,240
idea of

726
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,399
planting way more than you want and

727
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,919
leaving a bunch in and just watching the

728
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,080
process naturalize

729
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,520
and then intervening only when things

730
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,720
start taking over

731
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:01,200
um and and you know that's a lot of what

732
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,159
i believe is that you want the things

733
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,360
that come back

734
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,600
easily and naturally without much work

735
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,558
that serve a bunch of different roles in

736
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,918
the garden

737
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:14,240
and ideally it's a it's it's

738
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,679
it's managing the overgrowth in a good

739
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,319
garden versus

740
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,798
trying to get stuff planted in and you

741
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,639
know it's it's really about

742
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,918
it's being the the space is being

743
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,240
overwhelmed by life

744
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,600
and now you just have to make room in

745
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,400
that overwhelmed

746
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,639
space for your little plant that you

747
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,559
want to grow as say a cash crop that we

748
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,880
do like for cannabis so

749
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,599
i'm really in at this point when i'm

750
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,360
transplanting in i am making space

751
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:46,879
in a very diverse and and and strong

752
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:49,038
living plant guild um

753
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,440
and just i'm kind of just wrecking the

754
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,400
plants in one area so i can get a plant

755
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,120
into there

756
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,440
um so it bodes well for transplanting

757
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,719
and

758
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,360
it makes things a little more

759
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,600
challenging for direct seeding so

760
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,678
there are some pros and cons to most

761
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,918
practices yeah right on

762
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,440
so that brings us up to actual harvest

763
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,200
right if that's all stuff you're doing

764
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,640
before you're cutting your plants for

765
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,519
the season

766
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,960
let's talk about your routines after the

767
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,319
plants are hung

768
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,000
okay let's start let's so

769
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,639
one of the most important things and i

770
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
think is neglected

771
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,159
most of the time is that that time

772
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
just after harvest is really the time

773
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,919
that you need to be building

774
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,200
uh your potting soil for the next season

775
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,559
so we don't buy any soils we don't buy

776
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,080
amendments we don't buy stuff to make

777
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,200
our potting soils uh

778
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:48,319
we we use everything from on-site and

779
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,480
and and and wood chips i mean wood chips

780
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:54,000
aren't always from on-site but uh

781
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,558
our manures are on site uh my we we buy

782
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,839
hay

783
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,200
uh to bring to the farm so so there's a

784
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,720
couple things that we are gathering

785
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,480
off-site i don't wanna like

786
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,480
try and pretend we're a hundred percent

787
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,400
closed-loop i don't think anybody is

788
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,679
right now i think it's good to

789
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,480
uh be vulnerable and and

790
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,038
and share the processes that you know

791
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,599
are

792
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,558
our reality which is we do have inputs

793
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,240
for our

794
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,079
our potting soils but it's wood chips

795
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,960
and it's manure and and all the manure

796
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,079
that we get is from our own animals and

797
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,519
and so

798
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:29,678
um we basically you want to get that

799
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,240
into a space that's going to be covered

800
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,320
and and you want to layer that in a way

801
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,880
into a size where it's not going to heat

802
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:40,158
up too much i think everybody's

803
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,399
been brainwashed in in this

804
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,039
composting process to think that their

805
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,719
compost has to get to 140

806
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,319
for a certain amount of time and i think

807
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,720
a lot of this stems from

808
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,240
kind of the organic certification stuff

809
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,798
where it's like if you're going to apply

810
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,679
compost to your crops it needs to be

811
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,158
having

812
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,080
stayed at 140 for this long but what

813
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,679
people overlook in that scenario is

814
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,599
that's only if you're adding that

815
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,360
compost to the crop

816
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:10,719
before or within 90 days of harvest

817
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,639
but if you're not putting that

818
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,919
you can put manure directly on your

819
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,240
fields

820
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,000
and it's not an issue as long as you

821
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,960
have 90 days of growth

822
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,278
before that crop is harvested so what we

823
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,840
want to do is prevent

824
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,640
thermophilic composting we want to

825
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:32,398
prevent the heating of these piles

826
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,759
uh to 140. i aim for

827
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:38,000
a a range from 80

828
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,000
to 100 and i try never to get up that

829
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,079
much more above 100

830
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,200
and the reason for that is that is this

831
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,158
that is the

832
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,558
temperatures in which microbiology is

833
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,600
most

834
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:52,158
active and really i'm looking for as

835
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:55,038
much microbiological breakdown

836
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,760
while maintaining and retaining all the

837
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,158
nutrients

838
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,519
of the stuff being processed so cold

839
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,919
composting

840
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,558
actually puts and keeps the carbon in

841
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,360
the ground

842
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,480
hot composting you lose your nutrients

843
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,240
to the atmosphere

844
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,759
you start to put the carbon back in the

845
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,480
air this is what

846
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,839
we're not trying to do as say this term

847
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,159
regenerative that

848
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,839
seeks to put more carbon in the ground

849
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,200
than it takes out

850
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:24,319
so so the potting soil is is

851
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,519
done in our hoop houses which were

852
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,439
previously had grown uh plants in and i

853
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,158
do a lot of breeding in the hoop houses

854
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,558
there

855
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,640
um but those gal get cut down and then

856
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,678
everything comes down and i build this

857
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,080
this what looks like a berm inside of my

858
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,960
hoop houses and those are the berms that

859
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,678
i manage

860
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,399
through the winter to biologically break

861
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,159
down

862
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:50,639
and become stable well broken down

863
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,880
humus that is the potting soil for the

864
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,720
spr for the springtime

865
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
and that it's important for that to be

866
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,000
covered by

867
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,200
something you don't want the rains and

868
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,319
the weather to be

869
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,840
working on that pile because you want to

870
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,398
be adding the moisture

871
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,000
and reducing the amount of leaching and

872
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,038
making sure that that process

873
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,798
is happening uh in the right way

874
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,398
so that in the springtime you have a

875
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:18,079
really good uh

876
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:20,558
medium for sprouting seeds without

877
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,359
running into a lot of say damping off

878
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,319
and and

879
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,918
and and issues that come with uh things

880
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,119
that are less processed

881
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,440
um having more fungal

882
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,558
stuff going on and damping off is one of

883
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,000
those things that you have to pay

884
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,440
attention to with your

885
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,200
especially your sprouting soil mediums

886
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,120
not so much transplanting once the

887
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,240
plants a little bit older it can take

888
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:47,038
some of that stuff a little better but

889
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,640
if if you're not trying to create

890
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,599
compost piles

891
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,320
that are going to cook and you are

892
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,079
actually more

893
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,119
relying on time over the course of the

894
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,558
winter

895
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,439
for the manure to age and for the

896
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,558
compost

897
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,720
to increase in microbe life

898
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,798
i would think that your your thoughts

899
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,839
about the inputs would be different too

900
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:14,398
if you're not trying to get to 140. so

901
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,879
um i i would just guess that you're

902
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:16,479
using

903
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,080
everything that you find on the farm and

904
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,640
just creating lasagna but but

905
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,000
maybe talk a little bit about um what

906
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,440
these piles consist

907
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,119
of other than the manure that you've

908
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,159
already hit on okay

909
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:30,398
um first and foremost whenever you're

910
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,159
making a compost pile really that bottom

911
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,158
layer should be the fattest

912
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,240
chunkiest stuff you've got so wood chips

913
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,278
is always a great base layer but

914
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,000
if you've got a bunch of branches that

915
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,319
are smaller

916
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,038
twig like branches that's a good thing

917
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,439
too

918
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,640
basically what that does is it creates

919
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,519
this uh

920
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,840
this sponge for the more nutrient rich

921
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,519
that

922
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:53,599
because i do do the like the lasagna

923
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,558
layer just because it's kind of like

924
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,000
i can manage the manures the wood chips

925
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,480
the forest matter

926
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,759
um and and put them in the right places

927
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,200
and and anytime

928
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,839
you're creating or building soil of any

929
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,919
sort

930
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,079
this isn't just about compost even

931
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,000
though everything is getting composted

932
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,199
um but just in general you want to build

933
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,880
a bed you want to

934
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,399
you know you want to do things where

935
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,559
you're maximizing

936
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:19,839
all the potential of the things that

937
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:24,639
you're putting there

938
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:27,278
you want your biggest most lignin-rich

939
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,320
source of carbon at the bottom and you

940
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,240
want rich

941
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,798
nutrient uh dense stuff that's gonna

942
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,359
soak

943
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,798
that carbon because that carbon wants to

944
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,639
suck all that in

945
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,158
that carbon wants to hold all those

946
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,919
nutrients and

947
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,278
you know when people talk about wood

948
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,919
chips tying up

949
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,200
nitrogen or saying it makes the nitrogen

950
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,120
not available

951
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,960
there's a there's some truth to that but

952
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,759
we have to look at the benefits of that

953
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,319
that

954
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,119
when the wood chip pulls that energy

955
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,240
into it

956
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,759
now you have a much better food source

957
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,919
for the biology

958
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,759
because there's not just what the wood

959
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,200
chip was but now it's this

960
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,200
nutrient-rich tea that has naturally

961
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,200
infused itself into that so when the

962
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,960
fungus grows it actually grows

963
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,558
uh better so you know you start with

964
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,079
your wood chips on the bottom

965
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,639
and then a layer of manure uh a layer of

966
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,599
forest

967
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,960
leaves i go to the most diverse areas

968
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,240
usually the gulches

969
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,519
in my area where the horse tail and the

970
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,798
the the big leaf maples and the alder

971
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,079
and and the oak um are all kind of close

972
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,879
together so when i

973
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,759
gather the leaves um i'm getting a

974
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,039
diverse

975
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,278
uh mix of forest matter and

976
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,879
and really that's you know that's what

977
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,519
you want is that diversity

978
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,480
i i don't highly recommend people go out

979
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,798
and just start

980
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,159
hacking away into the forest soil and

981
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,639
start bringing that

982
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,080
because unless you're bringing something

983
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,159
to add to that

984
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,519
it's kind of just this taking from a

985
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,799
place and it's actually

986
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,960
maybe not that helpful to the place so

987
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,559
you know when gathering materials from

988
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,398
the forest you want to look at where

989
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,039
materials gather the most

990
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,279
easily and are deposited with the the

991
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,079
water or they fall and the wind blows

992
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,000
them into this

993
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,200
area and you want to be taking from

994
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,878
these basically forest matter deposits

995
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,158
that naturally occur

996
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,319
and that way you know it's going to

997
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,720
replenish in that spot over and over and

998
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,039
it's not necessarily you going out

999
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,279
and finding the best forest soil that

1000
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,159
you can and starting to dig into the

1001
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,280
soil i

1002
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,320
i'm really just kind of gently raking

1003
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,320
as much leaf matter and oftentimes my

1004
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,879
forest matter that goes into my potting

1005
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,359
soil

1006
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,440
is me cleaning up our access roads where

1007
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,159
all the leaves and pine needles and

1008
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,838
and that kind of stuff um are and i need

1009
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,760
to clean that because we need to be able

1010
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,759
to get up those roads in the winter

1011
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,680
to get to the shop so really you know

1012
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,760
it's it's kind of a great system in in

1013
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,399
that you know we're keeping the roads

1014
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,119
uh able to be used there but we're also

1015
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,160
getting

1016
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,838
all that energy that would naturally

1017
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:11,519
just turn into muck on the roads

1018
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:15,440
into uh a potting soil so um

1019
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:18,400
so you've got your your woody uh carbon

1020
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,440
carbonaceous layer you've got a layer of

1021
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,838
manure

1022
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,960
uh to soak into that and then you've got

1023
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,199
a layer of this

1024
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,039
forest leaves and then you might wood

1025
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,239
chip manure but you don't

1026
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,079
the biggest piece of keeping things from

1027
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,239
getting too hot is how

1028
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,519
big of a heap you make you know the

1029
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,000
bigger the heap

1030
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,280
with the same materials added will get

1031
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,320
to 140.

1032
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,440
but i'm keeping this in a long

1033
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,160
smaller heap and i'm with a temperature

1034
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,559
gauge just kind of watching how things

1035
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,279
um how the temperatures increase and

1036
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,358
rise and

1037
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,040
and if it starts to get too hot i'm i'm

1038
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,119
kind of opening it up and spreading it

1039
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,159
out just a little bit to prevent that

1040
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,358
from getting as as hot so you know the

1041
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,319
more you heat things

1042
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,199
up uh generally the hotter they get and

1043
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,800
quantity

1044
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,279
is is oftentimes the uh the the factor

1045
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
that

1046
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,640
kind of gauges what the temperature is

1047
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,319
gonna be at so

1048
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,078
you know if i i could make the same pile

1049
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,960
and if i added three times as much i

1050
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,519
might be thermophilic composting

1051
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,880
um but you know the other great thing

1052
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,159
about doing this in

1053
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,440
in my hoop houses is the hoop houses

1054
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,838
serve as the nursery

1055
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,838
and so when i'm filling pots to do

1056
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,920
nursery work it's always from the ground

1057
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,000
it's just from right where i'm standing

1058
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,400
and so it's really efficient from a

1059
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,358
working standpoint i'm not moving soil

1060
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,358
very far

1061
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,279
all the work has been done in the fall

1062
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:46,159
and now i just have my system

1063
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,960
dialed there um and and i have potting

1064
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,559
soil

1065
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,000
to scrape up off the ground anywhere so

1066
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,159
it's real basic it's not that

1067
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,639
complicated i'm not putting any kind of

1068
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,679
like

1069
00:36:54,639 --> 00:37:00,879
intensive uh

1070
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:03,759
inputs outside of the manure to

1071
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,400
add nutrients you know if i know the

1072
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,599
soil

1073
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,480
is naturally low in calcium i might

1074
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,400
try to shoot for more oak leaves because

1075
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,480
i know that oak is a

1076
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,000
a calcium accumulator so

1077
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,679
so there's a lot of factors there's a

1078
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,159
lot of thought processes there's no

1079
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:25,759
right way there's no wrong way uh

1080
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:28,559
there's just ways and and the way that i

1081
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,520
do it is is i i spend a lot of time

1082
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,440
thinking about it

1083
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,880
and i and i just do what makes the most

1084
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,159
sense and and you know i don't need to

1085
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,079
nobody needs i don't i don't mean

1086
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,000
for it to sound like this is how you

1087
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,160
have to do it it's just that

1088
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,440
there are some things to consider like

1089
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,279
you don't want to lose

1090
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,880
everything to the atmosphere because

1091
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,280
that's truly what we're trying to

1092
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,079
prevent and you get a much more stable

1093
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,599
end result

1094
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,839
when your biology has been supported

1095
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,960
the thermophilic composting supports

1096
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,119
pasteurization

1097
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,159
it it it heats up to a point where it

1098
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,838
kills everything

1099
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,598
that's what people mostly want because

1100
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:07,519
they want to be killing the weed seeds

1101
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,960
or the seeds that they don't want

1102
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,800
but you know i embrace uh all those

1103
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,079
all those components as a part of the

1104
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,400
living system

1105
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,119
and i'm not trying to kill uh and

1106
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,920
pasteurize

1107
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,240
seeds and i don't worry about uh

1108
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,800
pathogens in that scenario as long as

1109
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,039
the

1110
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,839
biology is strong enough to have done

1111
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,119
the work

1112
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:31,838
for a long enough period of time um

1113
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,240
i i don't i don't run into a whole lot

1114
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,078
of pathogen problems especially as

1115
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,919
the years roll by and the soil building

1116
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,800
has occurred in the same place over and

1117
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,680
over

1118
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,440
um right on that's a great explanation

1119
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,078
nick i especially like your idea that

1120
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,119
this is not the way there are many ways

1121
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,079
and when when you talk about it you can

1122
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,640
hear the reasoning behind what you're

1123
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,440
doing

1124
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,078
so farmers who are listening to this

1125
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,039
anywhere

1126
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,000
on the planet can go okay i understand

1127
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,679
how he's thinking

1128
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,838
about it and for me and the the plants

1129
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,000
and inputs that i've got where i have

1130
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,559
where i am and the types of soil

1131
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,239
i have i can go through these same sorts

1132
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,920
of thought processes

1133
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,838
and make a regenerative solution that

1134
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,119
works locally for me

1135
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,759
now before we go on to um the the rest

1136
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,320
of your

1137
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,040
your after harvest uh process and move

1138
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,039
into winter

1139
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,279
let's go ahead and take our first short

1140
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,279
break you are listening to shaping fire

1141
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,839
and my guest today is regenerative

1142
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,480
farmer

1143
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:34,480
nicholas mahmoud of green source farm

1144
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,240
as cannabis regulations become more

1145
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,960
demanding and consumers become more

1146
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,799
educated

1147
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,480
it is increasingly important to avoid

1148
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,160
the use of chemical pesticides when

1149
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,838
cultivating cannabis

1150
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,519
beneficial insects have been used for

1151
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,838
decades by the greenhouse vegetable

1152
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,358
and ornamental plant industry and today

1153
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,440
many cannabis cultivators

1154
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,119
are moving from sprays and chemicals to

1155
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,039
beneficial insects

1156
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,240
covert biological systems has the

1157
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,960
beneficial insects

1158
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,879
mites and nematodes microbials sticky

1159
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,039
cards and air distribution units

1160
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,480
you need to partner with nature to

1161
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,719
defend your garden

1162
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,800
whether you manage acres of canopy or

1163
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,559
have a simple grow tent in your home

1164
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,720
cobra is ready to help answer your

1165
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,039
questions and help you transition away

1166
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,639
from chemical sprays towards clean and

1167
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,440
natural solutions

1168
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,960
since 1967 culprit has assisted growers

1169
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,280
in identifying pests

1170
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,280
and devising reliable solutions while

1171
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,200
providing healthy insects and mites that

1172
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,760
will protect your yield

1173
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,559
since the 1990s cobra has been a leader

1174
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,880
in cannabis

1175
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:36,559
pest and disease control worldwide and

1176
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,400

oxygen is an essential plant nutrient

1194
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,599
and keeping sufficient dissolved oxygen

1195
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,079
in the root zone is a challenge

may not have considered

1199
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,599
no matter if you grow in soil

1200
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,079
hydroponics or aquaponics

1201
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,920
gaia's ultrafine nanobubble systems will

1202
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,960
increase your dissolved oxygen

1203
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,039
and increase your yield often the first

1204
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,960
sign of inadequate oxygen supply to the

1205
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,279
roots is wilting of the plant under warm

1206
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,119
conditions and high light levels

1207
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,720
insufficient oxygen results in an

1208
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,480
accumulation of toxins

1209
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,078
and an insufficient amount of water and

1210
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,559
mineral absorption

1211
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,318
if oxygen starvation continues mineral

1212
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,239
deficiencies will begin to show

1213
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,440
roots die back and plants will become

1214
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,358
stunted

1215
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,000
healthy roots supplied with sufficient

1216
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,799
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions

1217
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,480
selectively

1218
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,240
from the surrounding solution as

1219
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,639
required in studies

1220
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,759
this has shown a 30 increase in plant

1221
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,078
growth

1222
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,599
not only do ultrafine oxygen bubbles

1223
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,280
allow your plants to thrive

1224
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,519
but they will keep your drip lines and

1225
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,760
irrigation pipes and plumbing clean too

1226
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,759
because algae pythium and other invasive

1227
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,880
species only survive in low

1228
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,800
oxygen environments and the gaia system

1229
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,920
only costs about two dollars per day to

1230
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,960
run

1231
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,119
gaia ultrafine oxygen nano bubblers

1232
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,199
are also great for making compost teas

1233
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,599
and wild crafted nutrient teas

1234
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,318
the smaller bubbles of truly dissolved

1235
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,359
oxygen

1236
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:43,279
allow more microbes to reproduce faster

1237

with the national hemp program in flux

1243
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,560
due to stringent thc testing

1244
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,240
requirements

1245
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:01,838
brother seth and eric crawford continue

1246
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:02,799
to release seeds to hemp farmers that

1247
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:04,639
will be legal

1248
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,960
no matter how you grow them or when you

1249
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,960
test them these new varieties from

1250
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,559
oregon cbd seeds have substantial

1251
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,000
amounts of cbdv

cbgv cbcv and thcv

1253
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,679
while always staying below the 0.3

00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,838
percent thc limit

1255
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,759
and guaranteeing compliant crops for

1256
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,599
farmers every time

1257
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,960
also these new varieties cannot be

1258
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,240
pollinated by your neighbor's

1259
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,039
uncontrolled pollen

1260
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,598
or a rogue male in your own crop either

1261
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,639
oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

1262

1263
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,598
oregon cbd seeds was founded and funded

1264
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,440
in 2015 by seth and eric

1265
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,519
maxing out their personal credit cards

1266
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,200
without outside investment

1267
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,400
they continue to refuse outside

1268
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,078
investment that would change their

1269
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,800
company culture

1270
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,640
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

1271

00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:53,920
banks

1273
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,480
literally tons of food they also give

1274
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,240
away tens of thousands of pounds of r d

1275
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,639
flour to patients

1276
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,318
as their company began to succeed seth

1277
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,960
and eric started donating money to the

1278
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,960
cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause 2

1279

1308
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,318
farmer

1309
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,159
nicholas mahmoud of green source gardens

1310
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,679
so before the break we were talking

1311
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:17,679
about

1312
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:20,239
the late fall after harvest preparations

1313
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,559
that you do and we've talked a lot about

1314
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,239
wood chips influencing the quality of

1315
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,799
the soil

1316
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,919
the building of the type of compost pile

1317
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,760
that you most like

1318
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,280
to prepare your potting soil for the

1319
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,119
following season

1320
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,400
um is there anything else that we want

1321
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,680
to talk about

1322
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,960
about putting the property to

1323
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:44,399
bed before we move into you know winter

1324
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,800
and forest management and stuff

1325
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,280
well you know i think it's just really

1326
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,400
important that the soils all get covered

1327
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,280
uh that you're thinking about your

1328
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,639
your tubers and stuff uh spreading out

1329
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,319
you're thinking about what you want it

1330
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:01,199
to look like the next season and you're

1331
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:04,880
just kind of managing whatever perennial

1332
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:07,199
uh stuff you got going on um and that

1333
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,079
that varies between the different plants

1334
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,480
that are uh

1335
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,920
perennialized in the system so you know

1336
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,599
those are those are the important things

1337
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,680
so yeah we can move

1338
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,280
we can move forward all right great so

1339
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:19,519
so at this point

1340
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,440
we're getting later in the season we're

1341
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,199
we're into uh november december

1342
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,599
depending on where we are

1343
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,239
um you know the the rains have begun

1344
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,640
maybe the

1345
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,598
the temperatures have dropped um

1346
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:31,598
significantly

1347
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,200
heck if you're at high enough elevation

1348
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,240
you might be thinking about snow at this

1349
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,559
point

1350
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,919
and you know in in my head i'm usually

1351
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,799
thinking all right this is the time that

1352
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,639
you're gonna be

1353
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,720
you know in the house in front of your

1354
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,279
fireplace with your family

1355
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,879
and some of your celebratory flower from

1356
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,160
the summer

1357
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,079
and yet um you are outside uh taking

1358
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,920
care of things on your property

1359
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,519
that you know really are best done when

1360
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,240
you don't have more pressing things to

1361
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:58,639
do

1362
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,759
so so take us through what you're doing

1363
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:03,039
during doing

1364
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,720
during the winter all right um

1365
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:08,559
well you know one thing i like to think

1366
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:09,598
about a big picture ecological

1367
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,679
perspective

1368
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,760
and i'm always i'm not always

1369
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,838
a hundred percent focused on the garden

1370
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,359
but i'm i'm paying attention to the

1371
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,920
surrounding landscape

1372
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,039
and and trying to do my best as a

1373
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,760
steward

1374
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,000
to maximize what i can do in the right

1375
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,400
seasons in the winter time

1376
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,159
as the the moisture comes back into the

1377
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,599
system and the weather

1378
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:38,078
starts to permit the ability to

1379
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,160
start working on force management and

1380
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,359
and you know for us we rely on wood for

1381
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:45,358
heat so

1382
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:48,000
um you know in the winter

1383
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,400
based on the we have an 80-acre farm i

1384
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,880
only

1385
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,440
we only grow on a small portion of that

1386
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,079
and we're

1387
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,880
we're just in this really overgrown this

1388
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,880
is common in

1389
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,358
in most of managed forests in the west

1390
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,920
is that these these management practices

1391
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,358
have been

1392
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,838
seeking uh production uh first

1393
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:08,480
our forest lands are actually farms for

1394
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,358
trees

1395
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,159
and and in that process we've overlooked

1396
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,440
the

1397
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,399
potential ecological uh health of the

1398
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,480
system

1399
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,720
to maximize profit for logging companies

1400
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,000
and

1401
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:28,000
and and just for the land's sake uh

1402
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,119
and and and completely um

1403
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,159
just are doing terrible things in the

1404
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,358
long run

1405
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:38,879
for uh the potential of the place and so

1406
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,679
the winter time for me um has been a lot

1407
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,400
about

1408
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,440
looking at thinning the land that are

1409
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,599
overgrown

1410
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,480
and and and maintaining the larger trees

1411
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,599
on the landscape and and cutting down

1412
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,960
the overgrown

1413
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,599
understory of of trees that are just

1414
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,440
choking everything out and becoming a

1415
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,960
serious fire hazard

1416
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:06,240
um and so uh

1417
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,240
wintertime is a thinning time and and

1418
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,399
that's that's a big part of

1419
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,639
the work that is going to go down is

1420
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,200
once the fire season is over

1421
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:15,679
i'm thinking about the next fire season

1422
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:17,519
and

1423
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,759
and i'm thinking about how to get the

1424
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,759
landscape into a position where

1425
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,000
if a fire did roll through it wouldn't

1426
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,520
be detrimental but rather maybe even a

1427
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,199
little bit beneficial

1428
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:31,358
and so truthfully uh the forests have

1429
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,919
been managed by indigenous peoples on

1430
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:34,960
the west

1431
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,880
for uh longer than we can

1432
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:41,838
understand and to think that it's uh

1433
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,559
that there's this uh you have to leave

1434
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,199
nature

1435
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,359
alone in order for nature to be at its

1436
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,519
peak but the truth is is humans are a

1437
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:52,558
part of nature and so we're trying to

1438
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:56,039
you know understand our relationship to

1439
00:49:52,559 --> 00:50:00,160
ecology as a species of

1440
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:02,480
participating members in the ecology

1441
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,000
and you know so when we look to what do

1442
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,599
we do we should be

1443
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:12,400
uh sourcing the indigenous practices

1444
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:15,280
of the area to best uh promote um the

1445
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,880
ecological health of the forest uh we

1446
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,160
are participating

1447
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,880
steward um of the land and so

1448
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,799
uh what that looks like is is you know

1449
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,599
managing overgrowth and really this is

1450
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,800
like

1451
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,079
there's um there's some you know there's

1452
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,760
written things about everything but

1453
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,559
there's this idea that there's this

1454
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,000
principle

1455
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,880
uh i forget the full-on thing but the

1456
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,199
gist of it is

1457
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,079
is that there's a lot of things out

1458
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,799
there that if

1459
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,318
left unchecked will just take over

1460
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,359
diminish diversity

1461
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:50,239
and reduce the potential of the ecology

1462
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,639
and it's humans that can come in and

1463
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,519
help

1464
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,318
manage that for the diversity and when

1465
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,960
we think about

1466
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:57,679
health in a forest we're thinking about

1467
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,838
um

1468
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,199
we're thinking about layers uh within

1469
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,719
the forest and we're thinking about

1470
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,118
light penetration and we're thinking

1471
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:09,039
about canopy and we're thinking about

1472
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:11,358
um fire breaks that impede the ability

1473
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:14,400
for fires to be devastational

1474
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:17,679
um and so we're really

1475
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,960
immature in our understanding uh

1476
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:24,078
even just us being uh

1477
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,720
myself and my wife and landowners in

1478
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,480
general

1479
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:31,199
uh we're really we're at this time

1480
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,119
in in the world where the land hasn't

1481
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,639
been being cared for that well and the

1482
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,640
culture that we come from

1483
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:38,558
doesn't understand what care really

1484
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,639
looks like and so

1485
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,200
in order to begin the process of healing

1486
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,159
that and and repairing some of the harm

1487
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,879
that's been

1488
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,078
done we really have to look at things

1489
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,079
from an ecological

1490
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,280
big picture perspective and and

1491
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,359
understand that

1492
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,640
you know a healthy forest is one that

1493
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:59,119
has big trees that are spaced apart with

1494
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,440
with a bunch of different brush growing

1495
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,358
underneath and grasses that can grow in

1496
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,079
light penetration that can promote the

1497
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:06,639
diversity

1498
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,559
and vines growing into the trees and

1499
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,159
enough space in between the trees for

1500
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,359
fire not to just wreak havoc

1501
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:16,399
so i'm i'm spending a lot of time

1502
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:18,078
you know i do i'm starting the process

1503
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,920
of burning more just because the

1504
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,359
scenario's so intense you know i went

1505
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,800
through a process where i thought well

1506
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:24,880
we don't want to burn anything we want

1507
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,880
to sequester that carbon into the ground

1508
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,000
and that's you know that's that's a

1509
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,640
great idea but

1510
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,280
and the reality is um the state of the

1511
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:33,279
forest

1512
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,200
and where they're at in this the state

1513
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,400
of the danger of the fires

1514
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,399
is there's a lot of burning of brush

1515
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,838
and stuff that does need to be done if

1516
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,920
you could chip it all that'd be great

1517
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:45,599
but the truth is is we don't all have

1518
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,280
chippers and how much gas would it take

1519
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,480
to do that

1520
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,640
and so you know thinking about a

1521
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,519
fire breaks and and working on your fire

1522
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,598
breaks and

1523
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,358
and what that also does is it increases

1524
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,480
the light penetration which is

1525
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:04,799
increases the potential ground growth

1526
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:07,599
so you know we like to thin spaces

1527
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,280
strategically surrounding the homes

1528
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,960
surrounding

1529
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:15,519
our most valuable resources and then

1530
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,599
start the process of of getting the

1531
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,960
ground prepared to be able to grow

1532
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:23,359
more than just say all cedar trees um

1533
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,480
and and hopefully try to increase the

1534
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:26,639
diversity

1535
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,240
on the ground level as well as the

1536
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,400
canopy level um

1537
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,919
and then introducing animals to that

1538
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,240
once that's been done

1539
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,280
uh really helps but we're in the early

1540
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:38,799
stages you know

1541
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,240
i i really move slow in in making these

1542
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,079
big decisions because i really

1543
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:44,318
understand that i come from a

1544
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,680
a broken culture when it when we talk

1545
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:48,480
about stewardship

1546
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,639
and so i try to just not be too hasty

1547
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,119
and think i have the answers right away

1548
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,400
and

1549
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,800
and i i implement small scale and

1550
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,599
and watch and observe and and then i ask

1551
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,079
myself

1552
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,160
as honestly and openly as i can like was

1553
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:05,920
that a good thing for the earth

1554
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:08,159
and this area or was that just me

1555
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,079
practicing something i thought was good

1556
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,719
based on my

1557
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,920
you know my cultural brain washing i

1558
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,679
guess

1559
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,400
so you know it's really important i

1560
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,960
think that we

1561
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,480
think about things and be really mindful

1562
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,559
and and really have

1563
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,000
foundational principles of like what are

1564
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,200
we trying to achieve

1565
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,719
before taking action into the landscape

1566
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:35,279
uh and and implementing our ideas on

1567
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,558
upon the land and you know i always

1568
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,440
think about

1569
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,599
like the farm design shouldn't be

1570
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,039
designed by people it should be designed

1571
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,280
by the land that it's in

1572
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,400
and that people are just simply able to

1573
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,280
understand

1574
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,760
how the land is working and promote the

1575
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,640
healthiest potential of that space

1576
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,480
versus

1577
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:59,279
i want straight rows of this and i want

1578
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,639
my square block of this it's like nature

1579
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,720
doesn't work that way

1580
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,239
what we want to pay attention to is is

1581
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,118
how does the water move across the

1582
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,598
landscape

1583
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,760
what harm has been done previously how

1584
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,960
can we remediate some of that harm

1585
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,520
how can we increase subsurface return

1586
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,920
flow to the creeks and gulches how do we

1587
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:19,280
hold the moisture in the landscape and

1588
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,960
and that's what we want to be thinking

1589
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,240
about as we're doing these thinning

1590
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,318
projects because

1591
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,078
if we do say disturb the land in a way

1592
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,159
where we are going to bury some wood

1593
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,160
we want to do that on contour where the

1594
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,000
water then infiltrates and with the wood

1595
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,239
gets soaked and it doesn't just

1596
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,239
stay on the surface and get dry but

1597
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,798
rather it turns into a fungal

1598
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,078
thing that's all duffy and is isn't a

1599
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:42,480
fire hazard so

1600
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,720
i don't burn everything but i also don't

1601
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,199
bury everything so it's it's

1602
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:49,279
there's a lot going on there's a lot of

1603
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,639
thinking going on too we do spend time

1604
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,798
around the fire i am

1605
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,639
inside as well and i am enjoying that

1606
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:56,318
flower so

1607
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,558
so you know when we've talked about

1608
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,838
watersheds before and how the water

1609
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,760
moves across your land

1610
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:07,119
um you know you've talked to me about

1611
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:10,319
how you just go in and move a berm

1612
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,039
or or move a swale or you're you're

1613
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,599
physical

1614
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:14,318
about your relationship with the garden

1615
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,920
and

1616
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:21,039
you know so many times i i tour

1617
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,480
farms and and and folks

1618
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,279
don't want to move they don't want to

1619
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,318
move

1620
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,559
the growing beds

1621
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,679
and and other things on their property

1622
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,960
because they feel

1623
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:38,078
attached to where they are and and

1624
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:41,039
your approach is always the

1625
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,480
the water flow changes from year to year

1626
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:45,838
on your property

1627
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:49,039
and so during the winter you often

1628
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:51,838
will reorganize the

1629
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:52,079
farm and where where your growing spaces

1630
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,920
are

1631
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:58,640
based on the

1632
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,519
how nature is presenting itself on your

1633
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:03,199
property

1634
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:04,318
this particular season would you talk a

1635
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:07,919
little bit about

1636
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:10,719
your willingness to kind of

1637
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,838
mess with last year's garden and and

1638
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:15,838
remake it

1639
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:19,039
into this year's garden keeping in mind

1640
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:22,239
what nature is telling you it wants

1641
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:24,159
yeah yeah um this is a great

1642
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,439
this is a great question and and a great

1643
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,879
topic because

1644
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:31,838
you know so much in the the regenerative

1645
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,680
realm and and and the the better

1646
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:36,639
practices we talk about

1647
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:37,598
no till and i think sometimes that that

1648
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:40,798
i use that term

1649
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:43,760
a lot in the past um no till and and

1650
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:45,838
and there's a great reason we we glom on

1651
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,319
that and why that is so important is

1652
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,199
because

1653
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:50,239
undisturbed uh communities that are

1654
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,960
allowed to mature

1655
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,000
become more mature and and are able to

1656
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,199
evolve into a more

1657
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,079
resilient system now um

1658
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:01,919
there's there's some there's some parts

1659
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:05,200
of it that are a little off

1660
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,680
too as i evolve in my thought processes

1661
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,879
about it as a system becomes more mature

1662
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,118
and evolved

1663
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,400
sometimes disturbance and that doesn't

1664
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,880
mean tilling but

1665
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,838
i think about uh disturbance can

1666
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,440
sometimes

1667
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,558
stimulate and and allow the diversity to

1668
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,559
recreate itself

1669
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,599
and so i basically am looking at all the

1670
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,680
things i did wrong

1671
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:32,640
earlier uh in in my time as a

1672
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:33,679
somebody who is claiming to practice

1673
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,798
stewardship

1674
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:40,078
um i'm looking at where i didn't uh

1675
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:42,079
say uh form things in the way where the

1676
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,039
water was infiltrating at the best

1677
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,400
uh and and i go and i i will disturb

1678
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:49,440
that space

1679
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:52,559
um and sometimes even with a machine

1680
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,318
but uh only that that takes a lot

1681
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,920
it takes a lot for me to feel like i get

1682
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:57,440
behind a machine and start working on a

1683
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,760
landscape and thinking i'm doing any

1684
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,039
good

1685
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,960
oftentimes that's a that's a people make

1686
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,798
big mistakes on machines really quick

1687
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,559
and that that's hard to recoup but

1688
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:08,000
as you start to get an eye for it and

1689
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,280
you start to see where

1690
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
maybe some of the places where the con

1691
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,119
it wasn't fully on contour you can

1692
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,400
remediate

1693
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,240
by shifting things around and allowing

1694
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,280
the water to then become more

1695
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:26,399
uh able to return to the

1696
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:29,280
uh the water table

1697
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,000
subsurface versus uh seeing water

1698
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,240
draining

1699
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,159
off of something or taking you know

1700
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:37,598
we're always trying to create these

1701
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:40,480
uh sinks uh these places where the water

1702
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,200
sinks in and and you know understanding

1703
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,358
contour

1704
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:45,679
is really important for that and you

1705
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:47,838
know we did everything on our hillside

1706
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,440
by hand the first couple seasons

1707
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,960
and then after really getting to know

1708
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,440
the land a little more

1709
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,519
uh i we started to use a machine in

1710
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,159
there just to really help stimulate and

1711
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:00,079
promote

1712
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:01,199
that potential um so at this point i i

1713
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,440
don't say

1714
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:05,919
you know don't ever disturb anything i

1715
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,760
say once your system has become healthy

1716
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,599
a little disturbance here and there is

1717
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,079
actually a pretty good thing it starts

1718
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,000
to

1719
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:17,039
uh it resets some um ecological activity

1720
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,798
which which means that you're recreating

1721
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,079
some of the things that might not exist

1722
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,000
anymore therefore

1723
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,240
you're creating that again in a system

1724
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,960
that's mature and now the diversity is

1725
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:26,318
even greater

1726
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,079
and really we're seeking for that

1727
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:28,798
diversity i want a place where i can

1728
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,839
grow

1729
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:33,039
uh i can have an annual crop amongst a

1730
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:36,719
perennial system

1731
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:40,000
so um you know i

1732
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:40,558
yeah i i think you know in the beds this

1733
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,719
year

1734
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,200
i've taken and doubled some of them up

1735
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,358
and made the berms even bigger

1736
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,279
uh i know they'll be more productive and

1737
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:50,798
i know i'll be able to sink more water

1738
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,000
in the winter so

1739
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:55,599
um any time you do go in and disturb

1740
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,838
things there has to be a

1741
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,280
you got to understand that when you do

1742
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:02,078
disturb land

1743
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,839
you are breaking it down and and

1744
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,599
creating it to be more subject to

1745
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:09,279
to erosion and and so anytime you make a

1746
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,000
move in that direction you have to be

1747
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,400
prepared with

1748
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
either mulch or cover crop seed the

1749
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,480
timing has to be right

1750
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,798
you can't work in machines on wet land

1751
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,240
you have to be really mindful of how you

1752
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:22,960
go about your disturbance

1753
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,798
to minimize the potential negative

1754
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,720
impact that you can

1755
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:28,318
that you can certainly have without

1756
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:31,199
meaning to have and i think

1757
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,079
a lot of people have a lot of negative

1758
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:34,480
impact

1759
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,079
trying to do good things just doing them

1760
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,240
out of tune with

1761
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,079
how they should they should be done from

1762
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,318
an ecological perspective

1763
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,559
and um usually that's uh like the whole

1764
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,558
nine to five schedule you can't work

1765
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,559
on a nine to five schedule and say i'm

1766
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,680
gonna block out this week to do machine

1767
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,319
work and i'm gonna

1768
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:54,480
you know take this time to do this work

1769
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:57,038
you have to be flexible with

1770
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,000
the climate and the cycles of the of the

1771
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,160
cosmos

1772
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
in order to be the most effective

1773
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,838
participant in it so

1774
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,400
you know i don't i don't i wait for dry

1775
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:08,960
periods um i

1776
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,599
i have a short window of work period i

1777
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,358
can

1778
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,440
actually put a machine on the hill

1779
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,719
without really screwing it

1780
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,200
up the hill and maybe losing uh track on

1781
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:19,838
the

1782
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,639
excavator because of the mud you know so

1783
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:22,798
it's like

1784
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,118
you you have to be very mindful how we

1785
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:28,079
operate especially on a bigger scale

1786
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,119
um and in our impact and just make sure

1787
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,960
that we're doing

1788
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,480
all the pre-planning and staging of

1789
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,039
materials um

1790
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,719
to to heal that space once we do disturb

1791
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,720
it because regardless of how mature and

1792
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,199
evolved the system is how resilient it

1793
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:41,759
is

1794
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,679
um anytime we do make big disturbance in

1795
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,839
a space we have to come in with a

1796
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:49,118
a soft finishing touch that allows the

1797
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:50,318
re-establishment of the life that we

1798
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,599
want to continue

1799
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:56,719
to to be maximized so um

1800
01:02:53,599 --> 01:03:00,640
so yeah right on so before we finish up

1801
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:04,159
um the winter cycle i'm curious if you

1802
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:06,239
are spending any time producing your own

1803
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:07,279
inputs like you know are you are you

1804
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,558
fermenting

1805
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,599
foliars or or producing any additives

1806
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:16,000
on your um on your property

1807
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,039
we're going to talk more about uh manure

1808
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,199
in the next set

1809
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,200
but i'm talking about specifically like

1810
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:23,519
you know fermentations or

1811
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,798
nutrient teas or anything uh korean

1812
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:26,559
natural farming or

1813
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:28,639
you know do you do any of that kind of

1814
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,000
stuff during the winter and and how do

1815
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:34,159
you see those playing a role on your

1816
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:37,280
farm well

1817
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:39,199
i don't see them like from

1818
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,359
a conventional mindset of what you

1819
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:44,318
you're talking about like they

1820
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:45,119
like i don't practice any of that stuff

1821
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:47,279
but i

1822
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,240
see them playing a role in the systems

1823
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,720
i've created i

1824
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,078
see the fermenting going on but i don't

1825
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:55,118
actively separate

1826
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,440
the things that i want fermented so

1827
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,400
really all this takes place in the

1828
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,440
rhizosphere

1829
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:04,639
and and the mulches that are applied are

1830
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,119
the actual uh fermenting and the teas

1831
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:07,759
that

1832
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,400
when the rain falls on these mulches

1833
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,039
they

1834
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,480
create teas the fermenting happens in

1835
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,079
the different

1836
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,400
microbiology and the different

1837
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,680
temperatures of the organic matters that

1838
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,358
are accumulated

1839
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:23,358
and so all that is you know

1840
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,358
it doesn't make sense from a production

1841
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:27,440
standpoint if you don't have to be

1842
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:29,199
separating things putting them in vats

1843
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,880
creating infrastructure for these

1844
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:33,439
practices that

1845
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,200
are maybe not fully necessary maybe

1846
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,798
there's ways you can go about these

1847
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:38,480
things where it's happening

1848
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:40,318
and you're actually not doing the work

1849
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,159
of making it happen so

1850
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:44,000
i like to think about setting up the

1851
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:46,318
foundation of things so that those

1852
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,079
processes certainly are occurring

1853
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:51,920
but it's not me that's in control

1854
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,359
i like that answer a lot nick it wasn't

1855
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,318
the answer that i thought i was going to

1856
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:56,639
get out of you but

1857
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:57,838
i you know you're you're so continually

1858
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,920
not hype

1859
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:01,599
that i like the fact that you're like

1860
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,280
man i don't i don't need to do all this

1861
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,359
fermentation stuff in the off season

1862
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,079
because it's all happening in the soil

1863
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:09,279
it costs money whether you look at labor

1864
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,359
and time and

1865
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,280
and and these kinds of things it costs

1866
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,679
money to create those systems

1867
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,720
you know we're dealing with a uh if you

1868
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,759
really want to make it

1869
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:21,519
in a farming uh business you really have

1870
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,440
to have a low overhead and you really

1871
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:26,400
have to be efficient in your production

1872
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,960
and so you know do i want to have a

1873
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,160
barrel

1874
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,720
here and do i want to go gather this and

1875
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:33,838
and put it in here and stir it and you

1876
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,318
know it's like uh

1877
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:38,000
you know it's too big of a scale to try

1878
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:40,480
and do that for everything i think

1879
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,480
those practices are likely they're they

1880
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,400
all i don't believe they don't work

1881
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,920
uh i think they're all very functional i

1882
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,280
think they're tried and true in a lot of

1883
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,039
cases and i i

1884
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,599
agree with the foundational principles

1885
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,000
of gathering indigenous microorganisms

1886
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,960
and

1887
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,760
and all and i know about it all but do i

1888
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,240
practice

1889
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,119
practice it and physicality as a person

1890
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:01,838
in relation nah

1891
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,440
you know i just see it happening uh all

1892
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:06,880
around me and i try to

1893
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,159
i try to stack my resources into

1894
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,480
positions where

1895
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:12,000
i don't have to be in control of those

1896
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,119
things

1897
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,599
well you know if a lot of those

1898
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:18,960
processes of fermentation are meant to

1899
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,160
increase incubate incubate indigenous

1900
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,920
microorganisms

1901
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,558
essentially everything we have talked

1902
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:27,760
about today is incubating

1903
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:28,640
you know indigenous local microbes it's

1904
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,520
just that you

1905
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,239
are doing that right there in the soil

1906
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:34,480
instead of

1907
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:37,118
taking them away from the environment

1908
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,159
incubating them and bringing them back

1909
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:43,440
there's no question that you are you are

1910
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:46,639
multiplying your local

1911
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,400
you know healthy microbes and bacteria

1912
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:50,078
and fungi and all that kind of stuff

1913
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,160
just through these processes

1914
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,240
um just in a just in a way that's

1915
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:55,118
happening under a thick layer of wood

1916
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:58,399
chip

1917
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:00,318
yeah yeah wood chips leaves uh

1918
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,680
whatever's laying around right on that's

1919
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:03,119
a great explanation nick

1920
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:04,798
all right so let's go ahead and take our

1921
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,720

community on instagram

1952
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,760
as a business owner you are incredibly

1953
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,119
busy in reality you are responsible for

1954
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,960
everything your company does

1955
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,640
you've got so many responsibilities

1956
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,480
every single day that often you just

1957
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,960
don't have the time to really dig into

1958
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,158
your marketing as deeply as you'd like

1959
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,759
you know there's more that you could do

1960
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:25,439
to reach out to new customers and

1961
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:26,158
encourage loyalty in the customers you

1962
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,678
already have

1963
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,119
but you certainly don't have the time

1964
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,440
for it and you're not ready to hire

1965
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:34,318
somebody full time for that role either

1966
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,399
for you i recommend blunt branding at

logo

1972
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,719
packaging and website very pretty but

1973
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,679
they leave responsibility for improving

1974
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,679
your bottom line

1975
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,719
up to you they don't want that kind of

1976
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,239
responsibility

1977
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,560
but that's pretty much the most

1978
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:56,079
important part of marketing right

1979
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,319
kirsten and her team will help you

1980

point of sale whether it be online or a

1982
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,158
storefront and keep them coming back to

1983
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,919
you and telling their friends

1984
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,920
now if you happen to be a new cannabis

1985
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,319
company or an established company moving

1986

whole plant medicine terpenes heritage

1991
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,719
farmers and the particular needs of

1992
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,560
startups

1993
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,319
check out what she did recently for moon

1994
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,359
time medicinals and humboldt

1995
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,960
at moon time medicinals.com kirsten and

1996
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,920
her team put together a whole brand

1997
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,279
package for them

1998
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,679
built their website and wrote their

1999
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,199
sales materials no doubt this is a paid

2000
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,640
commercial spot but that does not mean

2001
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,559
they bought my opinion

2002
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,079
i've worked with blunt branding on five

2003
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,798
projects now for various of their

2004
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:44,479
clients and

2005
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:45,759
every single time they have done more

2006
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,198
than they have promised and over

2007
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,279
delivered on results

2008
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:51,119
i love how they generate new revenue and

2009
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,279
focus on that as the goal instead of

2010
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:55,119
just making a pretty logo

2011
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,800
similarly every single friend i have

2012
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:58,559
referred them to has come back to thank

2013
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,360
me and that just does not happen every

2014
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,039

01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:56,238
regenerative farmer

2080

nicholas mahmoud of greensource gardens

2081
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:59,119
so here we are we are back at the

2082
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,079
springtime it took us

2083
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:03,679
all this good honest effort over the

2084
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,920
fall and winter

2085
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,039
also that we are in the best position we

2086
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,719
can be on

2087
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:13,039
our property for this time when we are

2088
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,960
pulling the garden together and and

2089
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:18,079
setting it off for the summer

2090
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:21,520
so nick what are you doing um

2091
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:23,359
as uh you know nature is starting to

2092
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,120
wake up and they're starting to be buds

2093
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:27,119
on trees and you're starting to see

2094
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:28,800
like baby animals and all this kind of

2095
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:32,238
stuff early in the year

2096
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,920
what are you doing so that your garden

2097
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:36,639
can be in the best way

2098
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,480
possible to produce eventual beautiful

2099
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,640
flowers

2100
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:43,039
yeah so you know springtime is an

2101
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:46,320
important time

2102
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:48,319
in and again everybody's climate is

2103
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,359
going to dictate their practices

2104
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:52,238
and so i really am aiming to work with

2105
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:55,679
the climate

2106
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:58,959
in the best way possible and you know

2107
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:01,920
uh our manures that are in the barn

2108
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,520
all winter under uh preventing from

2109
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,520
being leeched and being gathered

2110
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,199
continually

2111
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,960
you know we feed our animals pretty

2112
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:10,479
heavy in the barn space to keep the

2113
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,760
manures accessible to us

2114
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:14,718
so that we can have a big pile to source

2115
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,199
from

2116
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,039
we start putting the manure on the

2117
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:21,039
garden in march

2118
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:22,238
but you know honestly everything we do

2119
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:24,479
on the farm

2120
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:25,359
because there's you know maybe this is a

2121
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,439
good time

2122
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,479
to explain like how many people are

2123
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,158
actually working

2124
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:35,599
uh for with us and it's not that many so

2125
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:38,399
every process that we go down uh my wife

2126
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,239
uh my brother has been working uh we've

2127
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:43,759
got one employee jesse

2128
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,559
and and uh and then you know the parents

2129
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,600
but they don't do

2130
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:49,520
any labor and that's it that's our

2131
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,560
that's our focus and so

2132
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,560
um you know what we're doing

2133
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,080
never happens that quick right so

2134
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,920
getting the manure on the field

2135
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:59,439
only starts in march because i can't do

2136
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,199
it all at once

2137
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,279
and it starts in march and it ends in

2138
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:06,319
june uh it really takes

2139
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:08,559
months of of pushing of gathering the

2140
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:10,479
manure into a truck and then moving it

2141
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,600
up to the space and then wheelbarrowing

2142
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:14,639
it out into the

2143
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,840
to the space where we want to grow so

2144
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,960
now this is a good time

2145
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:21,279
to just explain why we wait

2146
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,760
uh because i think a lot of people put a

2147
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:27,039
lot of manure on their yards in the fall

2148
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,000
and i and and that again could be a fine

2149
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:30,479
practice in an

2150
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,319
area where it freezes hard all winter

2151
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:35,198
and everything gets locked up

2152
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,880
and then doesn't even start its process

2153
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:39,919
of breaking down until it

2154
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:43,039
warms up in the in the springtime

2155
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:46,079
but in our climate it rains and it's

2156
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:48,238
wet and it rarely freezes and so

2157
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:50,960
we lose a lot in the winter and that's

2158
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:53,599
that's why the manure is protected all

2159
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,560
all winter and we wait till the spring

2160
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,679
um

2161
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,679
and then and then that manure is also

2162
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,119
going to be bacterially dominant in its

2163
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:04,640
breakdown process

2164
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:07,519
and and so we have a fungally

2165
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:09,119
supported network that's really rich in

2166
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,080
fungus up on the hillside from the

2167
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:13,198
winter

2168
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,079
of of wood chips and now what we do is

2169
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:17,039
we just

2170
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:19,359
where we want the cannabis to grow we

2171
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:22,560
wheel barrel loads of manure

2172
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:24,399
onto the space and that that that

2173
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,080
prevents things from growing there so

2174
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:27,679
that we have a clean easy spot to

2175
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,479
transplant things into

2176
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,000
but it also balances the bacterial

2177
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,759
fungal component and

2178
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,198
and starts to create a much more

2179
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,239
nutrient rich

2180
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:40,879
uh space now uh

2181
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:41,519
again we do this all the way to june and

2182
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,079
and

2183
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,600
even beyond in some cases depending on

2184
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:47,039
when harvest time you know we're trying

2185
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,800
to always aim for

2186
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:54,399
no manure from the barn uh on the space

2187
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,760
uh if for within 90 days of a harvest

2188
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:57,519
and that's just good to keep in mind

2189
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,360
especially from a commercial perspective

2190
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,320
to be adhering to some of the

2191
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:03,599
important components that you could be

2192
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:07,519
uh

2193
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,679
dealing with from a problematic place of

2194
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,440
of authority saying you did things wrong

2195
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:14,640
which is kind of annoying but

2196
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:16,479
um but yes so so

2197
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,560
you know the manure starts to get put on

2198
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:19,919
the field slowly and surely

2199
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,400
into the spaces that we want to

2200
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,199
transplant into and and that's

2201
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:26,079
prepping that uh perennials are being

2202
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:29,119
divided

2203
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,679
in this in the early spring and and so

2204
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:33,039
like

2205
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,840
the daisies are gonna get uh broken up

2206
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:37,920
and we're gonna

2207
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:40,719
expand those if we wanna put comfrey

2208
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,640
uh into places that are new we'll go

2209
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:45,920
ahead and break up some roots and

2210
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,239
and move them around and and uh yeah so

2211
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,960
the

2212
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:50,559
the perennial stuff is just mindful

2213
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,679
perennial management

2214
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,880
um and then the most important thing

2215
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:58,719
spring is the nursery work i mean for us

2216
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,960
we depend on a good nursery for

2217
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,000
transplanting it's it's easier for

2218
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,960
accounting for

2219
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,198
tagging we have this legal system that

2220
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,480
makes us just belligerently

2221
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:12,238
uh over tag everything and and

2222
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:14,399
essentially bring a bunch of garbage

2223
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,559
into the uh garden

2224
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:18,799
but you know hopefully they'll stop

2225
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,360
making us use these metric tags i swear

2226
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,560
that metric tags are the biggest amount

2227
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:26,238
of garbage i have

2228
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:29,199
on our garden um so hopefully that

2229
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:30,479
is no longer an issue once things are

2230
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:32,238
mellowed out a little bit on

2231
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,718
tracking everything because it's kind of

2232
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,879
ridiculous uh

2233
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,920
but uh the nursery work is really

2234
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,840
important and

2235
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,079
and you know the we talked about the

2236
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,560
composting for the potting soil well

2237
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,238
uh we didn't mention that that's turned

2238
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,360
about four or five times

2239
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:51,039
in the winter um and and also it's added

2240
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:53,759
to throughout the process so

2241
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:55,439
like after a bunch of the the cannabis

2242
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,039
gets trimmed up at the shop all the

2243
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:59,839
stems come back in

2244
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,039
and they go into the potting soil again

2245
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,279
so there's also

2246
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:04,238
layers of stems that end up in our

2247
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,800
potting soil

2248
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:08,399
to kind of rejuvenate the exactly what

2249
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,400
the cannabis plant wants

2250
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:14,238
um and so at that at the springtime

2251
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:15,439
in march when we do start our first

2252
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:19,678
round in like the second

2253
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:21,919
quarter moon cycle in march um

2254
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:23,039
what i what i'll do is i'll do a hot

2255
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,000
compost

2256
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:26,640
i'll block off one part of the hoop i'll

2257
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,600
come in

2258
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:31,199
i'll i'll layer a bunch and get the heat

2259
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,520
way up in that compost

2260
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:34,719
i mean i know that it's losing energy to

2261
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,159
the atmosphere but

2262
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:40,880
i'm utilizing the compost as a heater

2263
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,719
and i put the tables over that compost

2264
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,920
and that heat is pretty good for a

2265
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,560
couple weeks

2266
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,119
um so i know that if i just wait to the

2267
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,039
very end before i start popping my seeds

2268
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:53,679
and i heap all this stuff in there and i

2269
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:54,399
get that temperature to like 140 or even

2270
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,520
more

2271
01:18:54,399 --> 01:19:01,039
i'm i'm make i'm taking advantage of

2272
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,520
a naturally breaking down system to heat

2273
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:05,519
uh the space that i'm growing in we do

2274
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,239
have some supplemental heat

2275
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,080
as in involved as well but we try to

2276
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:12,559
reduce that as much as possible

2277
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,719
with this process of creating the heat

2278
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,520
in the compost we need it for that march

2279
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:18,079
round

2280
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,840
um and again it's a smaller round and i

2281
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:21,279
keep a smaller space heated so it's

2282
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,560
easier to heat it's less energy

2283
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:25,279
intensive

2284
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,280
but april is really the round for big

2285
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:30,960
amounts of seeds

2286
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:34,158
and uh you know the the nursery

2287
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:36,640
is is is in the hoop house and it's

2288
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:38,000
it's double tented and it has some

2289
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,360
supplemental heat

2290
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,679
um through through until may

2291
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:45,920
um when the the temperatures are are

2292
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:49,039
easily warm enough to not need that

2293
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,000
over uh the nighttime temps uh to

2294
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:53,600
maintain a certain

2295
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:57,279
level so um so yeah they

2296
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:59,600
you know we're planting some rounds

2297
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,880
again all the soil that we're sourcing

2298
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,760
is right at our feet

2299
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,840
uh so the uh filling of pots for

2300
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,880
transplanting is all right there

2301
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,679
um you know i'm i'm i'm starting things

2302
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,719
in flats

2303
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:16,399
so i can start hundreds of seeds in a

2304
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:18,480
a three foot square uh

2305
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:19,759
and then i'm transplanting into four

2306
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:21,439
inch until

2307
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,119
they become established and then i'm

2308
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:26,799
transplanting up into two

2309
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:28,559
to three gallon pots uh until they sex

2310
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,320
and so that process usually takes a

2311
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,639
month and a half to two months

2312
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:33,920
if all the growing conditions are

2313
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:37,440
adequate for

2314
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:41,039
vigorous growth um in that period um

2315
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:43,279
so yeah so you know

2316
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:45,119
nicholas hold on yeah i'm still thinking

2317
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:47,599
about your answer that you you got them

2318
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:48,399
you you you bring them pot up put up put

2319
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,199
up and

2320
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,920
into these three gallons and then you

2321
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,359
put them there

2322
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:57,520
until they show sex so what exactly are

2323
01:20:55,359 --> 01:21:01,359
you saying there are you saying that

2324
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:04,960
they're in these three gallons until

2325
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:07,359
um you know the the end of july

2326
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,039
um beginning of august when they're

2327
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:09,759
starting to flower show sex or do you

2328
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:12,800
mean that you

2329
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,840
are uh you are determining sex

2330
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,119
uh in veg or that you are taking clones

2331
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,319
and flowering some

2332
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,519
somewhere else and then using those as

2333
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:24,559
your canary

2334
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,840
of what what sex these particular clones

2335
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,000
are gonna be like to

2336
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,520
break that out a little bit okay first

2337
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,238
of all we'd never

2338
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,120
clone so um that eliminates that

2339
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:36,399
potential

2340
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:40,158
um we are sexing

2341
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:42,158
in in general most genetics

2342
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,359
especially when started earlier in the

2343
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:46,000
spring

2344
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:46,960
uh will will show a pre-flower at one

2345
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,279
and a half months

2346
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,158
to two months if grown if the growing

2347
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,079
conditions are

2348
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:54,638
are good there are some genetics that

2349
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:58,158
are super stubborn to show their sex and

2350
01:21:54,639 --> 01:22:00,079
you know there's an

2351
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:01,920
you can have a good eye for sexing

2352
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:02,960
plants when they're young it takes a

2353
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,840
trained eye

2354
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,279
it's it i've done it for other people

2355
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,920
i've made mistakes

2356
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:10,719
uh i certainly don't get every single

2357
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:15,119
one

2358
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:18,480
dialed perfectly but in general 95

2359
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:19,439
of of what's going down is pre-sexed in

2360
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:22,799
a veg state

2361
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:24,799
uh once it's matured and so

2362
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,920
you will see a pre-flower on most

2363
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,199
genetics

2364
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,119
uh given that circumstance um but again

2365
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,638
the march round the earlier stuff you

2366
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:34,960
start we also don't use any light

2367
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:37,520
manipulations of any sort so

2368
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,639
you know you can actually start some

2369
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,679
genetics

2370
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:44,960
in like say march and they will go into

2371
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:45,359
flower early and then you can hard prune

2372
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,480
them

2373
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:51,359
as the daylight is lengthening so you

2374
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:53,119
can guarantee that it's female

2375
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:55,039
it's starting to crown out and wanting

2376
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:58,079
to flower and then you do this an

2377
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:59,760
insane cut back to a couple nodes and it

2378
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:02,399
stunts it for a minute but when it

2379
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,719
starts to regrow now the daytime

2380
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:06,879
length is long enough to stimulate the

2381
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,639
veg growth so it regrows into more of a

2382
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,800
bush-like structure

2383
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,679
it's a technique that i wouldn't say you

2384
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,840
should do

2385
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:16,560
on everything but it certainly works

2386
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,279
well for some plants that are

2387
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,080
tend to go in and out of veg and flower

2388
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:22,960
easy

2389
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:23,519
some some genetics just will not will

2390
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,960
not come

2391
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,120
out of that phase and you'll have a

2392
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,520
stunted plants for months and you just

2393
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:29,840
won't

2394
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,679
you'll be disappointed if you start

2395
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,520
things too early and they flower too

2396
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,520
hard early

2397
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,880
with that said you know even if i start

2398
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,960
things in may and they're in full

2399
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,719
veg some genetics just so show that

2400
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,679
pre-flower once they're mature

2401
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:44,399
and and and it's a real easy thing to

2402
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,279
see

2403
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,638
uh when you have an eye for it but you

2404
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:49,439
have to know where to look and you have

2405
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:52,159
to be

2406
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:54,158
having seen it a bunch before the other

2407
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:56,000
thing was starting plants really early

2408
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:57,359
and and again i've done a lot of

2409
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
research and develop

2410
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:00,479
like r d on this with planting lots of

2411
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,760
seeds

2412
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:05,839
at in february in march in april and may

2413
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,199
and and and just for everybody's sake of

2414
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,000
understanding the best time

2415
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:11,039
april is your best shot april and may

2416
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,639
are you're going to have the least

2417
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:14,238
amount of problems if you want to get

2418
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,000
into learning a bunch of stuff and

2419
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:18,319
making some mistakes and having some

2420
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,920
issues start your plants in february and

2421
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:23,119
march you're going to have a

2422
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,520
a big lesson a lot of lessons you'll

2423
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:26,880
learn

2424
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,600
in that process but but one of those

2425
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,319
things is

2426
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,480
is plants will light stress in that

2427
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:35,039
confused state and herm

2428
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:36,718
uh even uh some genetics that even

2429
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:40,158
aren't that prone to herming

2430
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,359
when you put them in a a scenario where

2431
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,039
they don't they're not sure

2432
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:45,599
where they're supposed to be they stunt

2433
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:47,279
out they're they're stressed and

2434
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,880
their root growth isn't happening and

2435
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:52,158
they might herm

2436
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,960
um that same plant once it makes itself

2437
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:54,719
into veg

2438
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,880
might not hurt at all its whole

2439
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:59,520
lifestyle it might

2440
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,400
these are some things that i e i don't

2441
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,719
have any

2442
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:04,158
concrete like oh this will happen for

2443
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,639
sure this will happen for sure

2444
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,920
all i know is sometimes plants will herm

2445
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:11,359
if they're stressed early

2446
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:13,279
and they won't herm as they finish um

2447
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:14,960
oftentimes i just call anything that i

2448
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,880
see herming

2449
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,239
just because it's not what we want to

2450
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,639
stimulate we don't want

2451
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:22,399
more of that to deal with but i'm

2452
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,719
telling you some of the best genetics

2453
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:25,439
out there will certainly herm if the if

2454
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,920
the

2455
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:28,479
if they're confused in a in between

2456
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,800
state

2457
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:31,919
like waking up and then trying to flower

2458
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,600
too early

2459
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,199
and and then the daylight's getting

2460
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,000
longer and they're confused

2461
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:39,439
they go into this stunted yellowing and

2462
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
everybody thinks it's a nutrient

2463
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:42,879
deficient

2464
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,198
thing it's just it's either temperatures

2465
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:47,199
or it's just the light cycles just

2466
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:48,719
not in a zone where it's understanding

2467
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:50,799
what to do so

2468
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:53,198
there's a lot of intricacies within

2469
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,600
different genetics that need to be

2470
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:57,919
understood from personal experience but

2471
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,079
if you want to bypass all that learning

2472
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,840
you just go straight to april and may

2473
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:02,399
start your seeds and generally they'll

2474
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,840
just

2475
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:08,479
go right into veg um right on so

2476
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,480
i i'm sure that i am not the only one

2477
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:12,158
who heard in all that that you don't do

2478
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:14,158
any cloning on the property and i would

2479
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:14,960
be remiss if i didn't go back to that

2480
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:16,638
because

2481
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,600
you know you're clearly a thoughtful guy

2482
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,880
and you probably have got some

2483
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,920
interesting stuff to say

2484
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,199
so we want to hear it nick i don't feel

2485
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,719
strongly against

2486
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:29,839
cloning um but i have a goal as a

2487
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:33,119
a farmer or breeder to

2488
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:36,960
essentially evolve the plant as far

2489
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:39,519
along as it can and i don't believe uh

2490
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,359
maintaining the same plant for years and

2491
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,719
years is evolving that plant

2492
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:47,439
and so i believe in breeding and making

2493
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,439
seeds every year in order to evolve the

2494
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:50,158
plant and i think that's just a better

2495
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:53,359
way to go

2496
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,719
for advancing the potential um i think

2497
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:57,198
cloning is actually

2498
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,000
hindering the potential by just like

2499
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:00,719
getting stuck

2500
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,600
on one certain thing and you know on

2501
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,158
honestly

2502
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,199
a lot of people who are are breeding

2503
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:08,399
with clone

2504
01:27:05,198 --> 01:27:11,279
only stuff might not even know how

2505
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:11,759
good of a breeding stock that clone that

2506
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:14,880
is

2507
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:16,639
so what i'm saying there is oftentimes

2508
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,000
some of the best clones that you find

2509
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,359
are these poly hybrids

2510
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,158
that are new crosses of you know

2511
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:24,639
this cross to this times this cross to

2512
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,000
this

2513
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:30,239
makes a wide selection of some pretty

2514
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,639
cool genetics to hunt from you get this

2515
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:32,399
one

2516
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,000
killer one that has the traits that you

2517
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:36,638
want from all of them

2518
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,479
and and now it's this cut only thing and

2519
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:40,639
then people are seeking that

2520
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:42,638
clone to breed with because they think

2521
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:45,279
it's the best but the truth is

2522
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:46,000
by breeding to that clone you're

2523
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:49,359
actually

2524
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,479
going into some really unstable stock

2525
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:54,238
and you're you're actually taking

2526
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:55,839
your potential and you're you're

2527
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:57,039
diffusing it amongst a bunch of

2528
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,039
different potential

2529
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:00,238
and it gives you another poly hybrid

2530
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:02,319
like situation

2531
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:04,000
where you have to sort through and where

2532
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,960
maybe only one of the

2533
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,238
100 plants that you see are the ones

2534
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:11,279
you're looking for

2535
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:14,479
and versus

2536
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:15,279
continually breeding filial generations

2537
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:18,158
until the

2538
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:18,559
stock is predictable and then utilizing

2539
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:21,679
that

2540
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,159
as breeding stock i think there's a lot

2541
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:23,840
of

2542
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:25,679
people do a lot of back crossing in

2543
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,199
cannabis and and they generally are

2544
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,840
holding on to some mother and then

2545
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:29,359
they're

2546
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,880
running a generation and they're picking

2547
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:32,479
the best and they're breeding it back to

2548
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,840
that mother and then they're doing it

2549
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:35,439
again and bringing it back to that

2550
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,960
mother and so you get the back cross one

2551
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:40,238
back cross two back crusty

2552
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:42,560
but if that mother is not

2553
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:44,799
good breeding stock which oftentimes

2554
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,840
it's not because people just don't

2555
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,880
work their generations very far you're

2556
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,520
actually breeding

2557
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,560
back to an unstable breeding stock and

2558
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,600
now you're just

2559
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:57,199
continually taking your line and

2560
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,280
diminishing its potential

2561
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:00,399
is how i see it versus taking say

2562
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,840
something that's at like

2563
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:05,599
f10 and now using that stock

2564
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,520
if you're gonna be holding on to

2565
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,320
something in clonal

2566
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,760
form and and you hold that to do the

2567
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:13,920
back crossing too

2568
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,079
now i take it a step further i don't do

2569
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,719
any back crossing to mother plants i

2570
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:20,880
just do

2571
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:24,158
back crossing to the same parental line

2572
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,880
one generation further so you know if i

2573
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:28,079
if i put out something that i say is a

2574
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,880
back cross

2575
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:33,198
um what i'm saying is this is not back

2576
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:35,920
crossed to the one plant that i

2577
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:36,238
kept over winter i'm saying i'm crossing

2578
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,639
it

2579
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,718
back to the parental stock that came

2580
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,880
from that stock

2581
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,760
and i'm only doing that i'm only trying

2582
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,600
to back cross

2583
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,960
back to really things that are

2584
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,960
predictable so i

2585
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,960
have some kind of idea of what's going

2586
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:54,158
to come out in the following

2587
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:56,079
generation um so these are some things i

2588
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:57,920
feel like maybe have been overlooked in

2589
01:29:56,079 --> 01:29:59,679
the cannabis worlds where people just

2590
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,359
are like trying to do these cool back

2591
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:03,679
crosses but the truth is

2592
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:04,719
you keep getting these back crosses that

2593
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,520
are expressing

2594
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,639
so much diversity you're like well i

2595
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,000
thought that was supposed to be

2596
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,480
narrowing that

2597
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,560
and and i think that the biggest mistake

2598
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:16,799
is you know we're back crossing to poly

2599
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:20,880
hybrids versus back crossing to

2600
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:23,279
work lines um so that's just a little

2601
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,279
tangent on that and as far as clones go

2602
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:27,679
again like my main reason for not

2603
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:30,800
cloning is just to strengthen the plant

2604
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:33,119
uh and and and i i grow

2605
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,239
from seed for the commercial market so

2606
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:37,359
it's in my best

2607
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:39,119
interest to create seed that is

2608
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:42,000
going to be predictable so that i can

2609
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:44,079
put a a row of one variety in

2610
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,039
and know that all that's going to come

2611
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:47,279
down at a

2612
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:49,279
relatively the same time so i don't have

2613
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:51,920
to stagger the harvest like

2614
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:54,079
oh this plant's ready but the plant next

2615
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:56,480
to it needs another two weeks but

2616
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:58,000
the other one you know it's like you're

2617
01:30:56,479 --> 01:31:00,799
trying to

2618
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,679
gain predictability in breeding so that

2619
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,239
when you run

2620
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:05,840
things from seed you have an idea of

2621
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:07,519
what the outcome's going to be

2622
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,079
and you can apply the different

2623
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:13,120
varieties to the different situations

2624
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:15,039
now that being said uh if

2625
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:16,238
if you're out hunting for the

2626
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:18,639
potentially the

2627
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:20,559
you know your some new thing you're

2628
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:22,159
going to want to buy some poly hybrids

2629
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,800
with the genetic stock

2630
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:26,719
in the background of the things you like

2631
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,400
and then you can hunt that out

2632
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:30,480
now if you really want that to be a

2633
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:31,198
stable breeding stock now you have to

2634
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:33,198
breed

2635
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:35,039
and make selections over the next four

2636
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:38,479
or five generations to really

2637
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:40,238
hone and and and isolate the

2638
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:41,678
certain characteristics that you're

2639
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:43,519
interested in

2640
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,199
so that when you do breed with that

2641
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,239
stock you know that

2642
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:49,678
say this flower is going to be purple or

2643
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:51,599
that the trichome

2644
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:54,079
the exaggerated trichome development is

2645
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,880
going to be maintained within this line

2646
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:57,359
because

2647
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,560
the parental stock had been selected for

2648
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:00,319
that for

2649
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,000
you know five generations and at this

2650
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:03,599
point ninety percent is showing you

2651
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
exactly what you want to see

2652
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,960
uh that's good breeding stock but the

2653
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,840
old uh

2654
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:14,079
you know docido cross og cross sfv

2655
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:15,920
cross uh gelato mix

2656
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:18,479
combination that's a great phenohunt but

2657
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,560
that is not breeding stock

2658
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,718
right on so let's let's go a little

2659
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,280
further down this path man because

2660
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:26,960
um i never really thought about this

2661
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:31,279
quite in this way you know

2662
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:34,079
so many of the commercial uh cultivators

2663
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:35,519
they are you know they're buying seeds

2664
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:37,840
for the season around now

2665
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,800
they're popping them they're making some

2666
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,880
choices

2667
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,639
they're they're sexing and then they're

2668
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,840
they're making clones

2669
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:47,520
and mass so that they will be

2670
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,119
you know ready when it's time to go

2671
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,560
outside and

2672
01:32:49,119 --> 01:32:53,359
the first place that i found that

2673
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,039
actually just grew everything from seed

2674
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,679
and then made all their own seeds

2675
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:58,399
every year were the dragonfly folks up

2676
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:01,520
in canada

2677
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:03,119
kelly and josh and and when you know the

2678
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,880
first time i was sitting down with them

2679
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:06,559
in a tent and they were explaining that

2680
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,880
to me i'm like oh my god

2681
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:10,800
that is i mean a it's badass for

2682
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,000
self-sufficiency right i really like

2683
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,840
that part of it

2684
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,920
and when you get to the point as you

2685
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,760
have described where yeah you're making

2686
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:21,199
your own seeds but your

2687
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:23,730
own seeds are of such an advanced um

2688
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:25,279
f generation that they

2689
01:33:23,729 --> 01:33:27,119
[Music]

2690
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:28,800
they don't have as many irregularities

2691
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:29,439
you can you can plant 10 of them and you

2692
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,360
can know

2693
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:32,799
what the 10 are going to be you know

2694
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:34,799
pretty much looking like so that they

2695
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:37,360
can all be in the same

2696
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,039
bag for sale and that they'll be ready

2697
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:41,198
to harvest at the same time

2698
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:42,639
and so hearing you describe it i'm like

2699
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:45,198
my mind is blown again

2700
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:46,400
thinking about the additional thought

2701
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:49,119
and effort it takes

2702
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:49,679
to make all of your own seeds for the

2703
01:33:49,119 --> 01:33:53,119
season

2704
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:56,319
so um you've just given us a really

2705
01:33:53,119 --> 01:34:00,079
great you know august to

2706
01:33:56,319 --> 01:34:01,599
the spring snapshot of what you're doing

2707
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:04,079
for the good of

2708
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,600
the property and the microbes and the

2709
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:08,559
watershed

2710
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,679
uh holistically for the farm will you

2711
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,560
give us a little

2712
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:15,039
little conversation about you

2713
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,520
integrating a seed making process

2714
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:17,119
because

2715
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,800
you know we don't have to talk about the

2716
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:19,760
basics of making seeds we've talked

2717
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,480
about that here

2718
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:24,480
um a lot and and you know most farms are

2719
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:27,279
at least making a little seed to

2720
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:27,519
to experiment and and maybe come up with

2721
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:30,399
a

2722
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,600
a house cultivar you know that they can

2723
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:35,279
they can sell

2724
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:37,520
but when you're doing it at in mass

2725
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:38,800
like you are and you're relying on it

2726
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,880
for the next season

2727
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,480
how does that integrate on your calendar

2728
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,000
what are you doing on the calendar to

2729
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:47,519
make sure that you have

2730
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,319
seeds for yourself uh yeah this is a

2731
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,000
great question

2732
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:51,519
and and there's a lot to illuminate in

2733
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,319
this realm there's a lot that we're all

2734
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,159
still learning

2735
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,920
uh in terms of like how to do this

2736
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:58,960
really well um

2737
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,440
i'm i'm i'm beginning to understand it

2738
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,679
more

2739
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:02,719
as i do it more and more and and that

2740
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:06,239
makes my

2741
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:07,600
my uh seed creation better and better

2742
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:10,479
every year because i'm

2743
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,440
i'm carrying with me last season's

2744
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:13,759
learnings

2745
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:14,559
and every season compounds on every

2746
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,360
season

2747
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,800
um and so you know some of them really

2748
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:19,519
important things that people need to

2749
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,760
understand

2750
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,520
um and and i like to be really

2751
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,600
vulnerable and let people know where my

2752
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,679
weaknesses are

2753
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,960
in the process of making seeds you learn

2754
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:30,800
a lot about pollen

2755
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:33,359
and and there is a certain amount of

2756
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:36,639
like pollen contamination that occurs

2757
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:38,559
uh and and i'm certainly guilty of of

2758
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:40,239
you know having some unexpected pollen

2759
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,639
hit a place that i don't really want it

2760
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:42,879
to

2761
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:43,679
and and seeing that maybe in the next

2762
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,760
generation

2763
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:47,760
as i as i start looking at the plants

2764
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:50,079
growing however

2765
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:53,280
there are ways to and and this is these

2766
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:56,319
are the important learnings uh to

2767
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:58,960
maximize your ability

2768
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,479
to manage a lot of different pollens in

2769
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,520
a relatively small

2770
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:08,959
area and still come out with

2771
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:11,520
mostly uh you know 95 percent

2772
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,279
i don't know statistics really that's

2773
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:16,080
just my guess based on what i'm seeing

2774
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:16,800
um that it's all gonna come out like you

2775
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:19,519
want it to

2776
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,159
um and really these these tricks are

2777
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,199
about

2778
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:25,759
how to prevent yourself it's mostly

2779
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:27,519
me that is the pollen contaminator i'm

2780
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,520
the one collecting the pollen

2781
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,760
and i do that separate from the garden

2782
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,440
and it's generally inside in my house

2783
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,719
just up against the windows

2784
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:39,039
and and there's up maybe too many plants

2785
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:39,760
in one room to be really a scientific

2786
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:42,399
lab

2787
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,600
type scenario where i can guarantee 100

2788
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:46,319
all this and that

2789
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:48,159
but i'm also like in a position where i

2790
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:48,719
want to manage a bunch of different

2791
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:50,960
lines

2792
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:53,520
to advance those lines to become

2793
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:56,480
breeding stocks so it's important for me

2794
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,199
to be managing males of each variety and

2795
01:36:56,479 --> 01:37:00,000
many

2796
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:01,678
um and and what that leads to is an

2797
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
understanding of how to

2798
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:05,118
prevent yourself from being a pollen

2799
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,198
contaminator

2800
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,399
in the field so when i go from that room

2801
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:11,759
of collecting pollen

2802
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:15,039
which is happening basically from june

2803
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:18,239
until august um

2804
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:19,600
i'm i'm managing males and and and and

2805
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:22,959
dealing with pollen

2806
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:24,719
i go directly from my gathering pollen

2807
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:27,359
in the early morning

2808
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,639
with some coffee and and and to the

2809
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:31,439
field and working

2810
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:31,920
and and that's where i i'm a hairy guy

2811
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:34,960
and

2812
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,319
and and you know i sniff all the buds

2813
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,480
all the time and that's you know

2814
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:40,559
usually there's a seed on the very top

2815
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:42,158
of the bud because my nose was there and

2816
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:46,000
i was you know so it's like

2817
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:48,719
um but spraying yourself down with a wa

2818
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,399
a water bottle a water a spray bottle is

2819
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:54,480
a breeder's best friend

2820
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:57,118
and and and and then making your seeds

2821
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:58,718
in concentrated spots where you know the

2822
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,198
pollen that you collected

2823
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:02,239
is on the branch of that variety and

2824
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:04,399
that likely

2825
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:06,638
all of those seeds are going to be that

2826
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:08,638
you might not know what little seed is

2827
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,319
on every plant that's drifted and say

2828
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,800
there's a couple seeds in a bud here and

2829
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:12,559
there

2830
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,560
you can't track that but at least you

2831
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,880
can track that one branch and so i do a

2832
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,960
lot of single branch pollinating

2833
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:21,359
uh i use paper bags to collect the

2834
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,560
pollen i freeze the pollen sometimes

2835
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:25,039
when it's early

2836
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:27,440
and in letting the pollen go before the

2837
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:29,920
flower is ready to be

2838
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,279
pollinated and i'm making selections all

2839
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,319
over the field but i'm also

2840
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:34,399
concentrating

2841
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:35,759
certain seed production within a hoop to

2842
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:37,599
prevent uh

2843
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,840
more pollen contamination and then the

2844
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,800
hoop just has a layer of plastic that

2845
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,199
that gives me a little more ability to

2846
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,440
not

2847
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:46,559
end up uh you know you're paying

2848
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:48,559
attention to wind

2849
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,320
you're never pollinating in wind if

2850
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,679
you've got at least a barrier between

2851
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:52,479
you and the other plants is less

2852
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,079
likelihood

2853
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:56,479
you've got a spray bottle you're

2854
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:57,600
spraying down the area that you just

2855
01:38:56,479 --> 01:38:59,519
pollinated

2856
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:02,639
and you're you're doing everything you

2857
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:04,560
can to minimize pollen drift

2858
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,159
again i know breeders that are on the

2859
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,360
coast where it's so humid they don't

2860
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:09,759
even have to worry about

2861
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:12,399
pollen drift as much so the climate is

2862
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:14,639
going to dictate that and dry

2863
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:16,000
dry climates and that's we're in dry

2864
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:19,279
climate in the fall

2865
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,279
or summer and fall is is where pollen

2866
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:23,279
contamination can really be

2867
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:24,719
running rampant and that's where the

2868
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:27,439
water bottle and the

2869
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:28,719
after you collect pollen you you spray

2870
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:31,359
yourself down

2871
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:33,198
uh everywhere the the water will uh

2872
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:35,198
prevent the pollen from one getting

2873
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:35,919
airborne but two it also kills the

2874
01:39:35,198 --> 01:39:37,919
pollen

2875
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,359
uh eventually if it you know it doesn't

2876
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,118
kill it if you already

2877
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:42,799
pollinated the branch you can spray it

2878
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:44,000
and it'll still pollinate because you've

2879
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:47,279
already got it on there

2880
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,639
but um something to be really mindful of

2881
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:49,840
there's a whole bunch of stuff i could

2882
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,359
go into depth about

2883
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,199
when you want to pollinate to get the

2884
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:55,519
best seed production

2885
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:56,638
not waiting too long but trying to find

2886
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,719
that sweet spot

2887
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,039
i do all my selections on outdoor plants

2888
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:03,039
so oftentimes i end up breeding towards

2889
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:04,158
earlier finishing stuff even within

2890
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:05,679
different lines

2891
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:08,079
so i could take a line that may be

2892
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:10,000
finished in mid october but by the time

2893
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:12,559
i'm four generations down i've done the

2894
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,600
sift i've chosen to pollinate the ones

2895
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,840
that have shown resin

2896
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,119
earlier and now it's finishing two weeks

2897
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,719
earlier so

2898
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:20,839
you know there's a whole bunch of stuff

2899
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:23,760
going on in the breeding realm that's

2900
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:25,199
like worthy of exploring

2901
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:27,360
with all the different breeders and

2902
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:29,279
sharing the information because really

2903
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,839
what we want to do is not like hold on

2904
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:33,759
to this stuff as like some proprietary

2905
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,360
[ __ ] that gives is going to make us

2906
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,800
a bunch of money in the future but the

2907
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:39,118
only thing that's really going to

2908
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,840
create health and wellness for everybody

2909
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:42,000
in the future

2910
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,520
is shared information so that we can all

2911
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,479
be doing a better job of what we're

2912
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,320
trying to do

2913
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:47,678
and that way we can all be more

2914
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:49,920
successful um

2915
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,279
so i don't i don't ever worry about like

2916
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,440
you know uh

2917
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:54,479
do i save this information that i want

2918
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:56,799
to tell you

2919
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:58,479
uh for some consulting gig i'm gonna

2920
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,159
tell you the same stuff on this

2921
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:02,238
podcast that i would if you wanted to

2922
01:41:00,158 --> 01:41:05,519
pay me for it you know it's like

2923
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:07,359
um i don't have that uh entrepreneurial

2924
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,000
drive to just like

2925
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:11,599
find the gem that i can just bank a

2926
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,679
bunch of money off of because i really

2927
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:16,320
do believe that real capital

2928
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:17,199
is found in the land and in our

2929
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:20,000
practices

2930
01:41:17,198 --> 01:41:21,039
and in the health of the ecology and so

2931
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,760
by sharing and

2932
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:25,920
and giving the information freely it's

2933
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:27,920
almost like puts the burden on everybody

2934
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,840
else to continue to do the same thing

2935
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,960
and to stop this process of

2936
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:36,880
i want to get rich off of what i know

2937
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:39,920
um and and think that you know i'm gonna

2938
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:43,279
uh you know just kind of capitalize on

2939
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:44,880
other people's uh inability to do things

2940
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:47,840
you know it's kind of

2941
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:49,279
so so yeah there's a lot there's a lot

2942
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,000
in the breeding realm that we all need

2943
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:51,679
to be

2944
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,840
uh paying attention to but really

2945
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:56,719
practice is is gonna be the

2946
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:57,920
the most important thing um right a lot

2947
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:00,319
of people

2948
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,359
that aren't practicing as much as they

2949
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:03,519
maybe should be

2950
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:05,839
i've got a very specific follow-up

2951
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,639
question so we have been talking about

2952
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,079
how

2953
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:12,800
um the the the thriving nature of your

2954
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:16,000
plants and the abundance of the flowers

2955
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:19,520
is primarily based in the fact that they

2956
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:22,560
are participating in a complex

2957
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:25,360
organism that is your property

2958
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:26,960
um that is you know incubated with

2959
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:30,079
indigenous microbes

2960
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:32,880
has got you know an abundance of local

2961
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:33,760
varied nutrients a lot of it wild

2962
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,000
crafted

2963
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:38,320
a lot of it from your animals so that

2964
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:42,479
you know you've created this matrix

2965
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:46,000
of life support and because of that

2966
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:49,039
your flowers um do so well

2967
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,760
how does that play into the seed

2968
01:42:49,039 --> 01:42:52,560
creation

2969
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,360
because you know we we could go down

2970
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,719
this path

2971
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:56,559
and just turning you know turn this

2972
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,158
whole last set into a breeding set but

2973
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,840
that's not really the goal since we want

2974
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:02,960
to focus more on

2975
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,000
on you know this the seasonal impacts on

2976
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,760
your property

2977
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,520
and how to you know work with that

2978
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,520
regeneratively

2979
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,280
what kind of hints might you have to

2980
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:14,400
offer us about

2981
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:17,359
um making seeds on

2982
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:18,799
a farm that is using regenerative

2983
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:21,519
practices maybe you can

2984
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:23,039
you know give us two or three of those

2985
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:26,080
yeah so

2986
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:29,039
making seeds you know

2987
01:43:26,079 --> 01:43:30,639
you can make here's the thing you know

2988
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:34,560
if you have a space that

2989
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:38,000
actually is that uh life support

2990
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:40,159
uh super resilient uh really diverse

2991
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,439
you can take what people consider to be

2992
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:43,920
the worst pot

2993
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:45,839
and grow it and and get something very

2994
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,239
good you know something way better than

2995
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,719
what

2996
01:43:46,238 --> 01:43:52,238
it was when you saw it last um

2997
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:55,359
so there's something to be said for just

2998
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:58,718
the the really healthy rhizosphere

2999
01:43:55,359 --> 01:44:00,559
and and heavy mulch buffers the soil

3000
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,319
rhizosphere to a degree that makes

3001
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,280
things possible that you wouldn't see

3002
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:06,639
elsewhere

3003
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:09,198
um therefore uh

3004
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:10,960
i believe all cannabis is really good

3005
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:14,399
because

3006
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,520
i see it expressing itself in a really

3007
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:18,238
healthy environment

3008
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:20,639
and therefore what somebody might assess

3009
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:22,319
and say is just low quality weed

3010
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:24,400
might actually be high quality weed

3011
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:27,679
given the right circumstance

3012
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:30,799
in making seeds in this environment

3013
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:33,679
it's like any other environment truly is

3014
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,079
about selections and so the more plants

3015
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:37,359
you have

3016
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:40,479
to select from the the better selection

3017
01:44:37,359 --> 01:44:43,599
process you can have the better the sift

3018
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:44,319
um you might it might be called breeders

3019
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:48,639
use the term

3020
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:52,000
sifting through genetics uh and and so

3021
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:54,159
you know really um the biggest

3022
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,039
i think the biggest mistake that gets

3023
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:57,519
made and

3024
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:59,039
i've made is is like i just think i know

3025
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:02,480
which one is the best

3026
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:05,519
and i just put put everything on that

3027
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:06,879
and then to come find out at the end of

3028
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,480
the season it molded

3029
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:13,039
uh or molds um that's a reality

3030
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:14,799
that's why you can't just only pick the

3031
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:16,560
ones you think are the best i say if

3032
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,880
you're making seed

3033
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,400
go ahead and make seed on a lot of the

3034
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,719
different plants that you have

3035
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:23,519
again not the whole plant and and this

3036
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:26,319
is where the

3037
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:27,040
the details are important but um just on

3038
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:29,519
a branch

3039
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:31,279
just because you don't know how it's

3040
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:34,960
going to finish until it finishes

3041
01:45:31,279 --> 01:45:36,960
and so i like to think i can make

3042
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,800
all the best selections that's me doing

3043
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,679
the work but the truth is

3044
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:42,159
i need to stop giving myself so much

3045
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,960
credit

3046
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:47,279
i need to be looking at the plants and

3047
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:50,639
and saying they're all super valuable

3048
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:52,559
i can't make predictions uh before the

3049
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:54,319
end result so i just need to make sure

3050
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,719
i'm i'm getting some pollen on all of

3051
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:57,519
them

3052
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,079
so that when oh man the one that i

3053
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,800
thought

3054
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:01,920
was wasn't the best turned out to be the

3055
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,279
best because

3056
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,000
you cannot pollinate the plant when it's

3057
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:09,439
done

3058
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:12,158
you know what i'm saying so um

3059
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:13,919
you can't make you you can make your

3060
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:15,679
predictions but they're just predictions

3061
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,840
they're not set in stone science you

3062
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:19,840
didn't see it finished so you don't know

3063
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:21,039
so you just i've just learned you've got

3064
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,600
to like

3065
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:25,679
you can't just think you know you have

3066
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:28,800
to be really humble in the process

3067
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:29,760
and and just just stay open to the fact

3068
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,320
that

3069
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,000
you know you have an ego and your ego

3070
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:36,079
oftentimes wants you to believe

3071
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,039
you have some kind of valuable

3072
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:39,198
information

3073
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,800
more so than other people but the truth

3074
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:43,759
is that's not the case

3075
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:45,600
and really the more broader spectrum

3076
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:49,039
practices you can have

3077
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:51,360
the more likely you'll realize

3078
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:52,960
that you did something that preserved

3079
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,118
what it is that you really wanted

3080
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:56,960
um because we don't always know let's

3081
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:58,799
let's hit that another time nick because

3082
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,679
like you're talking about the the ego

3083
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,520
part of this

3084
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:02,800
and i gotta tell you you know listening

3085
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:06,080
to some

3086
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,079
of the

3087
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:09,759
i don't say this negatively but i'm

3088
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,800
going to use the word loose listening to

3089
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,560
some of the more

3090
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,760
loose breeding practices that you've

3091
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,560
talked about you know you're like hey

3092
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,960
man i

3093
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:19,199
i'm the one who accidentally lets you

3094
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,639
know pollen go on my shirt or on my nose

3095
01:47:19,198 --> 01:47:22,719
or whatever or

3096
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:24,719
or you're collecting pollen together in

3097
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:28,158
your living room and stuff it's like

3098
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:31,039
like for for people who are coming

3099
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:33,359
to cannabis from a real control place

3100
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:36,719
right a real ego control place

3101
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:39,279
um that sounds like oh my god

3102
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:40,800
that's such poor manufacturing god knows

3103
01:47:39,279 --> 01:47:41,439
what's going to come out the other end

3104
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,679
right

3105
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:45,759
but but i know what comes out the other

3106
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:47,920
end of your farm right i have

3107
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,600
i have enjoyed your flowers i've seen

3108
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,560
lots of different flowers at different

3109
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,639
times a year

3110
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,320
i've toured your property i've grown

3111
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:56,880
your genetics

3112
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:58,960
i know a lot of people who have you know

3113
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,319
flocked to your genetics and they rely

3114
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:03,760
on them so

3115
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:04,639
we know that what comes out is pleasing

3116
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,960
people

3117
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:09,118
and doing their job and being used

3118
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,719
reliably on other people's farms in the

3119
01:48:09,118 --> 01:48:13,198
form of seeds

3120
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:15,039
but also it's coming from this

3121
01:48:13,198 --> 01:48:15,919
environment that you're working in that

3122
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:19,279
i would not

3123
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:22,319
call um it is

3124
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:25,039
it's like invitations to nature

3125
01:48:22,319 --> 01:48:26,799
versus control and i know that that's

3126
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:28,960
pretty much how you live your life

3127
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,279
and i can't be the only one hearing you

3128
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,800
talk who's having this kind of like

3129
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:36,559
internal being torn both directions

3130
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:38,480
where it's like oh my god his

3131
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,800
his work all sounds so holistic i want

3132
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:41,759
to smoke that flower and i want to grow

3133
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,279
those seeds

3134
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,600
and at the same time i've got the part

3135
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:46,000
of me and going like oh my gosh those

3136
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,039
seeds

3137
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,639
are not all going to be exactly the same

3138
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:52,800
speak a little bit to just how you

3139
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:55,760
resolve that for yourself

3140
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,719
well i i say you know you try out seeds

3141
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:00,239
and

3142
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:02,719
you know it's like uh i'm

3143
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:04,319
i've tried a lot of seeds and so you

3144
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:06,399
know i've seen

3145
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:07,679
what's coming down the lines of all

3146
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:10,638
these other

3147
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:11,118
uh breeders and and and stuff and i love

3148
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:13,840
it all

3149
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:14,559
and i thank everybody for making seeds

3150
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:17,599
um

3151
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:19,199
but once you start getting further down

3152
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:21,119
the filial generation and this

3153
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:22,238
i can only say it comes from experience

3154
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:24,880
like

3155
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:26,638
again i like to give myself the let

3156
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,400
people know the vulnerabilities in the

3157
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:31,599
in the places where maybe i'm not

3158
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:34,719
as controlled as people want um but

3159
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:36,400
the proof is in the pudding and i'm

3160
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:39,599
cracking seeds

3161
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:42,479
and i'm reliably getting what i say

3162
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:43,360
is coming from the parental lineage i

3163
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:45,678
can tell

3164
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:46,639
and and again this is about getting

3165
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:48,960
better at it

3166
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:50,719
you know like i'm way better at it now

3167
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:54,319
than i was four years ago

3168
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:55,039
and so uh by staying open and continuing

3169
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:57,439
the process

3170
01:49:55,039 --> 01:49:58,880
and watching the seeds grow you can

3171
01:49:57,439 --> 01:50:00,638
start to really

3172
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:02,239
dictate whether your practices are

3173
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:02,960
functioning the way that you want them

3174
01:50:02,238 --> 01:50:06,319
to

3175
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:09,679
and you know and giving the power

3176
01:50:06,319 --> 01:50:10,880
over to nature into those natural

3177
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,118
processes is

3178
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,319
always going to strengthen your your

3179
01:50:13,118 --> 01:50:18,319
stay your stock

3180
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:21,439
and um and and i i would say just like

3181
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:24,639
you can buy or you can acquire seeds

3182
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:26,479
uh for from a bunch of different people

3183
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:28,639
and just grow them out and just

3184
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:30,319
ask yourself what looks similar what

3185
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:33,039
doesn't um

3186
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:34,719
you know truly if you cross something

3187
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:36,000
that's dank to something that's dank

3188
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:38,480
you're gonna get dank

3189
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,359
and it might not all be the same dank

3190
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:40,799
but it's dank

3191
01:50:39,359 --> 01:50:43,519
you know so it's like that's where i

3192
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:46,639
started when i began the process but

3193
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:48,400
now i'm like oh f1 stock is

3194
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:50,719
so good when you're working with

3195
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:52,079
breeding stock on both parental lines

3196
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:54,239
that it's worth making

3197
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:56,639
sure that you continue the filial

3198
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:58,000
generations on the lines with the traits

3199
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:01,039
that you're looking for

3200
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,039
so you can make those f1s later

3201
01:51:01,039 --> 01:51:05,279
for people who are in production because

3202
01:51:03,039 --> 01:51:08,560
really the f1 stock

3203
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:08,960
is for commercial production this is

3204
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,440
where

3205
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,960
we have like if you're a commercial

3206
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:14,079
producer and you want to grow things

3207
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,639
from seed

3208
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:17,599
you you want to be looking for that f1

3209
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:20,400
stock that is

3210
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:21,199
real f1 stock that means both parental

3211
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:24,559
lines

3212
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:27,198
have been worked for years and years and

3213
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,119
are coming out at least predictable and

3214
01:51:27,198 --> 01:51:31,279
then when they mesh together

3215
01:51:29,118 --> 01:51:33,439
they actually come out really uniform

3216
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:37,079
with some traits from both sides

3217
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:40,079
and the hybrid vigor the hetero

3218
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:41,519
heterozygosity is way higher so you're

3219
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:43,519
getting yields you're getting

3220
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:45,040
terpene results that are way more

3221
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,960
complex

3222
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:48,800
it really is where the best weed is

3223
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:52,399
going to come out of is these

3224
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,960
uh f1 crosses and you know when you're

3225
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:56,158
working

3226
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:58,399
lines down generations and generations

3227
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:59,598
you might actually even see the overall

3228
01:51:58,399 --> 01:52:02,399
return

3229
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:04,239
like become less and maybe the

3230
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,238
percentages even become less but that

3231
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:07,919
doesn't mean

3232
01:52:06,238 --> 01:52:09,678
it's going to make something that's not

3233
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,960
good that

3234
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,440
that's the piece that's kind of

3235
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,560
confusing is as i take some things into

3236
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:15,839
the f6

3237
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,840
generation they're testing lower than

3238
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,840
they ever have but their offspring

3239
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,279
are combining so well with the others

3240
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:24,079
that it shoots the

3241
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:25,439
numbers up in all the categories so you

3242
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:28,238
know it's it's

3243
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:28,479
it's a game that that we're all playing

3244
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:32,000
and

3245
01:52:28,479 --> 01:52:34,079
and everybody gets so uh demoralized

3246
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,920
when their test result maybe comes back

3247
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:37,599
lower than they want but hey

3248
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,118
if you understand that those test

3249
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:40,639
results can come back lower and you

3250
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:41,679
don't have to grow that one for

3251
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:44,639
commercial production

3252
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:46,480
but if you use that one in making a

3253
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:49,039
cross with another

3254
01:52:46,479 --> 01:52:50,000
one that is inbred and maybe doing the

3255
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:52,800
same thing

3256
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,000
the result doesn't mean a low percentage

3257
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:58,000
in that case it

3258
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:00,000
i'm finding low percentage inbred lines

3259
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,760
combined together make the highest

3260
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,800
percentage outcome

3261
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:06,320
um which is you know i look at a lot of

3262
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,800
coas and i'm

3263
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:11,118
you know because i have to get tests for

3264
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:13,039
every lot that goes into the market and

3265
01:53:11,118 --> 01:53:14,158
all this stuff i'm getting a good idea

3266
01:53:13,039 --> 01:53:17,039
of the overall

3267
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:18,960
background genetics and each lineage and

3268
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:20,639
and i'm able to kind of run with that

3269
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:22,399
and then look at like when i take a

3270
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:24,239
terpenoline variety

3271
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:26,399
and i put it on the mirror scene variety

3272
01:53:24,238 --> 01:53:28,319
do i see both terpenoline and mirosine

3273
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:28,960
or do i see one just kind of eat out the

3274
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:32,000
other

3275
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:35,039
and the case is is when there

3276
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:38,880
those lines are inbred i'm seeing

3277
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:42,319
both of the parental uh terpene profiles

3278
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:42,960
combining into the offspring i'm seeing

3279
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:47,439
the

3280
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:50,560
thc levels increase and on the offspring

3281
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:52,158
10 higher than either parent uh so

3282
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:54,080
you know there's a lot of things that

3283
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:57,279
i'm just not willing to say we know

3284
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:59,519
yet uh because i i just need to continue

3285
01:53:57,279 --> 01:54:02,079
down the process of r d

3286
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:03,040
growing these seeds every year making my

3287
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:06,639
selections

3288
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:09,198
growing those seeds looking at the tests

3289
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:11,118
you know it's it's and there's there's

3290
01:54:09,198 --> 01:54:12,799
flaws in everybody's breeding program

3291
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:15,359
and it's important for us to recognize

3292
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,440
the flaws so that we can work on them

3293
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:19,598
and that's really where we gain strength

3294
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:22,399
is when we see our weaknesses

3295
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:23,920
we work on those weaknesses we see our

3296
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:25,118
strengths and we understand our

3297
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:28,239
strengths and we

3298
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:31,198
we move forward uh with that holistic

3299
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:31,759
kind of approach of like knowing we have

3300
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:34,799
more

3301
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:39,440
more to learn and that we're not just

3302
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:42,400
all the best breeders in the world um

3303
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:44,000
i want to finish with this today nick so

3304
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:47,039
i've been to your property

3305
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,560
and a lot of your examples

3306
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:50,560
you're able to do on your property

3307
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:52,719
because you've been doing this year over

3308
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,080
year for a lot of years you've put a lot

3309
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:57,118
of labor and love

3310
01:54:54,079 --> 01:54:58,719
and calendar into your property

3311
01:54:57,118 --> 01:55:00,639
and a lot of folks who are listening

3312
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:02,719
today um you know

3313
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:05,279
either either maybe they've got a new

3314
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:07,679
farm or they're converting their farm

3315
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:09,279
from from traditional agriculture you

3316
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:10,158
know traditional industrial era

3317
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:12,639
agriculture

3318
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:13,598
practices to becoming more regenerative

3319
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:15,118
or maybe you know

3320
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:17,840
it's a farm that's trying to convert

3321
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:19,118
themselves right to get you know a

3322
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:22,079
quality

3323
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:22,559
um you know regenerative certification

3324
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:24,158
like the

3325
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,679
the dread the you know the dem pure

3326
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:27,359
certification or something like that so

3327
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:30,079
you've got a lot of people who

3328
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:31,118
who have got an ideal that they share

3329
01:55:30,079 --> 01:55:33,599
with you

3330
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:35,198
but they they're at the beginning of the

3331
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:38,639
game whereas you know

3332
01:55:35,198 --> 01:55:42,079
you're you're you know many years

3333
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:45,199
into this game um what words

3334
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:48,158
of reassurance do you have for

3335
01:55:45,198 --> 01:55:48,960
folks that um that they should go along

3336
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:52,638
this path

3337
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:54,239
even though the the labor and the amount

3338
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:54,560
of time that it's going to take to get

3339
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:57,279
there

3340
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:58,320
seems so long when you're when you're

3341
01:55:57,279 --> 01:55:59,840
when you're teaching

3342
01:55:58,319 --> 01:56:01,840
you know you don't really teach as much

3343
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:04,560
growing cannabis right you teach

3344
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:05,440
biological systems and that takes some

3345
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,599
time

3346
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:11,198
so so so we'll finish off here by i'll

3347
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:12,880
give you the mic and i'll say what what

3348
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:15,919
message do you have for these folks

3349
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,719
who are at the beginning of this path oh

3350
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,000
man

3351
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:22,319
um well

3352
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,359
first and foremost you have to love this

3353
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:25,118
plant like

3354
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:26,719
i've been obsessed a little bit with

3355
01:56:25,118 --> 01:56:29,598
cannabis ever since i

3356
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:30,719
started integrating my experiences in

3357
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:34,159
nature

3358
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:36,800
with being affected by this

3359
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:37,598
cannabis plant so you know most of the

3360
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,320
people

3361
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:40,800
that are trying to go down this route if

3362
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:42,719
they're

3363
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,840
if they're into it for the money i can

3364
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:45,760
say you're gonna fail

3365
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,199
if you're into it because your passion

3366
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:50,800
is there i say

3367
01:56:47,198 --> 01:56:53,839
don't get too caught up in uh

3368
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:56,400
uh you know trying to make

3369
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:58,560
a ton of money off of it just get stay

3370
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:02,399
focused on the passionate piece

3371
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:05,520
but also like if you're into breeding

3372
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:10,399
if if somebody would have told me uh

3373
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:12,800
hey like just even even six years ago uh

3374
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:14,158
just hey you're gonna want to pay

3375
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:17,360
attention to

3376
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:18,638
keeping your lines as pure as you can so

3377
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:20,639
it doesn't matter if you get a poly

3378
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:23,039
hybrid to start with but just

3379
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:25,039
keep working those filial generations

3380
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:28,000
until you see something

3381
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:28,719
uh coming out uh more uniform that's

3382
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,560
kind of the most

3383
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:32,639
important work and especially from an

3384
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,960
outdoor i grow one

3385
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:36,639
crop a year i don't do indoor i'm not

3386
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,960
running multiple seasons through the

3387
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:39,760
year and advancing populations very

3388
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,719
quickly

3389
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:44,560
um i i want to see the f10 generation

3390
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:45,679
but i've got to wait four more years you

3391
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:47,920
know so like

3392
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:49,679
if you if you're starting and you really

3393
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,359
are passionate and you really want to be

3394
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:54,239
developing something that

3395
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:56,079
is is is something you've really helped

3396
01:57:54,238 --> 01:57:58,559
steward and shepherd

3397
01:57:56,079 --> 01:58:00,079
and and can be feeling really good about

3398
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,480
is that you start

3399
01:58:00,079 --> 01:58:03,118
the process of of gathering what you

3400
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:05,598
want and

3401
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:07,839
keeping those lines in those lines for a

3402
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:10,639
while before you start mixing them

3403
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:12,000
because what inevitably happens and this

3404
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:14,079
is speaking to breeders

3405
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,520
again like if it's it's all it's all

3406
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:17,439
different based on your goals and

3407
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:19,520
outcomes but i'm really like

3408
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:21,198
weighed towards breeders because i'm

3409
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:24,159
really passionate about it

3410
01:58:21,198 --> 01:58:25,919
um is that it it's it's like don't get

3411
01:58:24,158 --> 01:58:28,719
too wrapped up in like

3412
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:30,239
making a like crossing everything

3413
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:31,760
because there's something so dank over

3414
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:32,879
here and there's something so dank over

3415
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,639
here that you just

3416
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:36,079
know that those are the two best and if

3417
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:38,480
you put those two

3418
01:58:36,079 --> 01:58:40,880
together and the male pollen you only

3419
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:42,718
have one male that you've selected for

3420
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:44,960
all of your crosses it's like

3421
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:46,880
that's just narrowing your potential and

3422
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:48,319
potentially taking you down a path you

3423
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:52,319
don't want to be

3424
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:53,198
keep your lines going in their own

3425
01:58:52,319 --> 01:58:55,279
directions

3426
01:58:53,198 --> 01:58:57,118
before you start crossing them and if

3427
01:58:55,279 --> 01:59:00,719
you can acquire some

3428
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:02,000
inbred lines that's the way you want to

3429
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:03,679
go you want to buy

3430
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,198
inbred lines something that somebody's

3431
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:06,800
worked for a while you could take it and

3432
01:59:05,198 --> 01:59:08,399
continue the work

3433
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,800
in a different direction within that

3434
01:59:08,399 --> 01:59:12,399
line because there's always a spectrum

3435
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,960
of what's going to express

3436
01:59:12,399 --> 01:59:17,359
uh within a certain line of cannabis we

3437
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:19,118
don't hone every single trait we might

3438
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:20,399
hone a couple of traits that we know are

3439
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:22,719
going to pass on

3440
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:24,559
but in the long run there's all kinds of

3441
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,359
there's flower morphology there's plant

3442
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:28,000
structure

3443
01:59:25,359 --> 01:59:29,759
there's leaf type there's all these

3444
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,639
different traits that you know might get

3445
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:32,960
bypassed

3446
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:33,679
and and look to for only the resin and

3447
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,319
flower

3448
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:36,800
um and so there's always a little bit of

3449
01:59:36,319 --> 01:59:38,319
a

3450
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:39,840
there's always a spectrum to choose from

3451
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:41,920
even from a work line

3452
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,440
but to keep those lines continually

3453
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,399
worked and then

3454
01:59:43,439 --> 01:59:48,158
start crossing those lines later and

3455
01:59:46,399 --> 01:59:50,399
you'll have a much better result

3456
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:51,198
is my belief and i wish somebody had

3457
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:53,359
told me that

3458
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:56,399
you know a long time ago i just had to

3459
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:58,559
like realize that in my journey

3460
01:59:56,399 --> 02:00:01,519
of just studying really it's been about

3461
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:04,000
studying uh crops outside of cannabis

3462
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:05,360
um and how breeding occurs in those

3463
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,319
crops and then

3464
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:10,639
taking some of those uh scientific

3465
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:12,479
learnings from the world of agriculture

3466
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:14,639
and applying them to the cannabis it's

3467
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:16,718
really it's just a plant as a plant it's

3468
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:18,719
they're all different but some of the

3469
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,760
breeding practices can certainly

3470
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:24,639
um result in similar

3471
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:27,199
end results like if you want to grow for

3472
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:29,599
outdoor production you do want real

3473
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:31,839
f1 stock you don't really want to be

3474
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:33,360
hitting the ibl's on that

3475
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,279
so i'm going to ask you the same

3476
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:35,598
question but with a different emphasis

3477
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:38,479
right

3478
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:40,000
okay so so you know you won regenerative

3479
02:00:38,479 --> 02:00:41,839
gardening awards and

3480
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,840
you've you know a lot of people look up

3481
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:44,960
to you and how the you have developed

3482
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,840
this property

3483
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:49,679
and for people who may not be breeders

3484
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:51,520
but they're on a new property right they

3485
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:52,960
don't they don't have any hugel cultures

3486
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:54,320
they're just building their first

3487
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,319
berms they're trying to figure out

3488
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:59,359
what's in the forest around them

3489
02:00:56,319 --> 02:00:59,920
and it all seems like so much right

3490
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:03,118
because

3491
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,960
it is it can be so much um

3492
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:06,880
what what words of inspiration do you

3493
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,000
have for people who may not be breeders

3494
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,920
heck they might not even be

3495
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,679
growing cannabis right this is you know

3496
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,960
the kind of show we've had today

3497
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:14,960
we haven't actually used the word

3498
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,639
cannabis all that much it works for

3499
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:20,000
cannabis but it's also going to work for

3500
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:22,159
for food crops as well and so so

3501
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,039
what what kind of like final parting

3502
02:01:22,158 --> 02:01:25,439
shots or

3503
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:27,039
or inspiration do you have for folks who

3504
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:28,960
are looking to grow

3505
02:01:27,039 --> 02:01:30,560
in their biological system and they're

3506
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,960
feeling like oh my god this is going to

3507
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:35,280
take the rest of my life

3508
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,000
that's a great question um and and i i

3509
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:39,279
really like to

3510
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,198
address this one in in this way that

3511
02:01:39,279 --> 02:01:42,719
again it it's probably not what people

3512
02:01:41,198 --> 02:01:46,000
are expecting me to say

3513
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:47,679
um but the truth is is if you're gonna

3514
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
connect with your landscape you have to

3515
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:51,599
take

3516
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:54,479
time to connect with it and so stop

3517
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:56,000
all the research and looking for the

3518
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:57,598
answers online

3519
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,238
and looking for the answers through

3520
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:01,360
people like me and looking for answers

3521
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:04,479
from anything but

3522
02:02:01,359 --> 02:02:07,598
your land and start the process of of

3523
02:02:04,479 --> 02:02:08,238
slowing down and and taking time to

3524
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:10,319
spend

3525
02:02:08,238 --> 02:02:12,238
in the spaces that you want to cultivate

3526
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:14,000
and asking the land

3527
02:02:12,238 --> 02:02:15,598
uh you know it's not like you go out

3528
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:19,039
there and physically

3529
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:20,639
make a loud noise that is asking a

3530
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:22,399
question but you go out there and you

3531
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:25,920
listen and you observe

3532
02:02:22,399 --> 02:02:29,759
and and you pay attention you take time

3533
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:34,239
it's not even like oh land what can i do

3534
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:38,000
to grow you know really awesome things

3535
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:41,598
it's more like what is this land

3536
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,439
what is what are we and and meditate

3537
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:45,520
on some of the deeper things so that you

3538
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:47,839
could start to pierce

3539
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,960
the veils that have been put in front of

3540
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,319
our our

3541
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:56,000
realities and start to really

3542
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:59,118
hone in on this idea of humans

3543
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:02,719
are here and can have really

3544
02:02:59,118 --> 02:03:06,079
healthy positive impact on landscape

3545
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:09,679
what is healthy what is

3546
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:13,279
uh what is gonna really make this place

3547
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:14,399
thrive and and so it's really a deeper

3548
02:03:13,279 --> 02:03:17,840
internal

3549
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:21,679
uh uh deprogramming

3550
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:22,719
and and and and smoke weed when you do

3551
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:25,760
it

3552
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:28,399
i i guarantee if you you know

3553
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:29,039
utilize cannabis in in the natural

3554
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:32,079
setting

3555
02:03:29,039 --> 02:03:33,519
with the right intentions um it really

3556
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:36,880
helps guide you

3557
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:37,920
into the aha moments that are much less

3558
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:40,639
likely

3559
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:41,279
to come across uh watching a youtube

3560
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:44,719
video

3561
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:45,519
on some regenerative farms you know it's

3562
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:48,239
like

3563
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:49,679
um spend your time in nature if you want

3564
02:03:48,238 --> 02:03:52,479
to connect with nature

3565
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:53,359
and be a voice for nature you have to

3566
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:56,078
live there

3567
02:03:53,359 --> 02:03:57,039
to to to have that understanding

3568
02:03:56,078 --> 02:03:59,359
otherwise

3569
02:03:57,039 --> 02:04:02,319
you're just trying to find the answer

3570
02:03:59,359 --> 02:04:04,479
and and the answers are not concrete

3571
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:05,599
um they are way more philosophical than

3572
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:09,039
we want them to be

3573
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:11,760
this is not a measure your input and

3574
02:04:09,039 --> 02:04:12,960
and if you put this down it will work

3575
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,679
it's more like

3576
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:17,439
you have to do the work with the with

3577
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:19,279
the world you want to live in

3578
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:20,638
and and it doesn't always look like the

3579
02:04:19,279 --> 02:04:23,279
work you want to do but

3580
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:24,159
oftentimes it starts from your within

3581
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:27,759
and it starts

3582
02:04:24,158 --> 02:04:29,679
with how you interpret what you see and

3583
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:31,280
so if you're already down the path and

3584
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:34,000
you really want to do good

3585
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:35,118
you really have to start exploring well

3586
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,158
what do i think

3587
02:04:35,118 --> 02:04:40,799
is doing good and how is that maybe not

3588
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:44,078
so good and what are the cultural

3589
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:48,079
uh problems with this

3590
02:04:44,078 --> 02:04:49,759
you know colonial uh consumer capitalist

3591
02:04:48,078 --> 02:04:52,960
society that

3592
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:55,199
is all about uh killing life

3593
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:56,480
and and monoculture creating

3594
02:04:55,198 --> 02:04:59,359
monocultures

3595
02:04:56,479 --> 02:05:00,000
um we have to understand we've been

3596
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:02,559
super

3597
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,319
super affected by that culture and we're

3598
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:06,800
still in that culture

3599
02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:08,880
and our thought processes are are kind

3600
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:12,000
of geared towards that culture so

3601
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:12,800
when we start getting into the periphery

3602
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,800
zone of

3603
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:16,079
of making advancements into the

3604
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:18,800
potential of

3605
02:05:16,078 --> 02:05:20,319
our ability to steward land it starts to

3606
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:23,440
look like we're anti

3607
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:25,439
the culture and in some ways it feels

3608
02:05:23,439 --> 02:05:28,879
like a path that is very

3609
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:32,000
outside the norm and very feels like

3610
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:34,000
everybody is just uh

3611
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,520
on a journey that's just destroying the

3612
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,359
planet and we really

3613
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:38,880
you know we really have to connect with

3614
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:42,078
nature again in order to

3615
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:43,359
actually realize how we can help uh the

3616
02:05:42,078 --> 02:05:46,078
process of nature

3617
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:47,359
and even understand what a healthy

3618
02:05:46,078 --> 02:05:50,559
ecology is

3619
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:51,198
so when we were preparing for this show

3620
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,880
nick

3621
02:05:51,198 --> 02:05:54,399
you said this one thing that struck me

3622
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:57,199
and i put it in my notes

3623
02:05:54,399 --> 02:05:59,359
you told me you don't grow good cannabis

3624
02:05:57,198 --> 02:06:00,879
by focusing on the cannabis you grow

3625
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:03,279
good cannabis by being a good

3626
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:05,359
steward of all the biological systems

3627
02:06:03,279 --> 02:06:07,679
surrounding the cannabis

3628
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:09,359
and i think that's a recurring theme

3629
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:12,000
that goes throughout this show

3630
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:13,759
is that you know if you're taking care

3631
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,399
of the entire living matrix

3632
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:18,159
around your garden that that can only

3633
02:06:16,399 --> 02:06:19,279
benefit your plants and it's probably

3634
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:20,559
going to benefit them

3635
02:06:19,279 --> 02:06:24,078
more than the rest of the crap you're

3636
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:28,079
doing exactly and it's going to benefit

3637
02:06:24,078 --> 02:06:30,078
everybody and every thing on the planet

3638
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:31,279
at this stage you know any kind of work

3639
02:06:30,078 --> 02:06:35,359
we can do

3640
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:37,599
towards taking care of our ecology

3641
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:38,479
is work that is worth doing at this

3642
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:40,880
point

3643
02:06:38,479 --> 02:06:42,238
right on well nick thank you so much for

3644
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:44,078
taking the time to be with us

3645
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:46,158
especially at this early morning time

3646
02:06:44,078 --> 02:06:48,238
we're on farmer's hours today

3647
02:06:46,158 --> 02:06:50,000
and uh so thank you for taking time away

3648
02:06:48,238 --> 02:06:51,439
from the garden and your family for this
