2
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:10,609
most people in the cannabis scene assume

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,199
they know how to judge good flower

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:15,088
subset of those people also think they

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,089
have advanced enough skills to even

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,589
judge cannabis competitions alas most

7
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,289
people are using their own subjective

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,868
standards and preferences while thinking

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,970
that they are being objective this gets

10
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:28,800
played out with very serious impacts

11
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,379
when wholesale cannabis buyers are

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,500
judging who to buy from for their retail

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,350
outlets but perhaps even more impactful

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,439
is when subjective preferences cloud the

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,789
decisions of cannabis cup judges today

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,949
we're going to talk about some of the

17
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:46,979
finer points of judging the merits of a

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,770
cannabis flower how disreputable judging

19
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,619
is at most cannabis competitions and the

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,160
certification called interpreting that

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,558
is - cannabis what a semi a

22
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,538
certification is - wine if you enjoy

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,159
hearing frank discussions that dive deep

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,750

enthusiasts today we're going to talk

47
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:54,209
about judging the qualities of cannabis

48
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,799
flowers welcome to the show max always a

49
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,569
pleasure Shango thank you so much for

50
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,030
having me back so let's jump right in

51
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,669
max so you know cannabis enthusiasts

52
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,200
have a wide range of reasons they deem

53
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,019
cannabis to be good or bad you know like

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,939
like some stalkers it for some folks is

55
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,310
just the amount of THC right all they

56
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,259
look is that as the THC percentage and

57
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,569
then they buy the one that's the highest

58
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,699
whereas you know some more experienced

59
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:20,578
folks are you're looking for terpene

60
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,768
profiles but but similarly patience

61
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,840
right our most often judging flower

62
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:27,060
based on if it gives them relief or what

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,039
not and all these folks are looking at

64
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,680
the same cannabis in different ways and

65
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,239
you know that's that's totally happened

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,709
because there's never really been an

67
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,069
established standard for judging

68
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,769
cannabis but then you with the trichome

69
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:42,988
Institute built this interpreting

70
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:46,650
program which is kind of like a not kind

71
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:50,250
of it is a saw my a like certification

72
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,530
for people interpreting the standards

73
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,810
for cannabis so so what are the key

74
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,049
aspects that you've put together for

75
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:03,628
judging the quality of cannabis flowers

76
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:07,469
um well I think before I want to dive

77
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:09,768
into the aspects that we put put forth

78
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:13,378
to judging the flower is it fair to

79
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:16,889
maybe first look at all the different

80
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:21,959
types and reasons why judging and

81
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:23,639
grading cannabis is important in our

82
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,519
industry today yeah sure I think

83
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,469
everybody from a patient to to uh to a

84
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,969
retail buyer to the grower I mean I

85
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,549
think everybody is judging for their own

86
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,139
so-so letter let's you probably teased

87
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,419
out more of that than anybody so so

88
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,669
let's you're sure sure so you know how

89
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:43,799
in our industry everyone grows the best

90
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:45,299
weed CCI everybody does right so so

91
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,639
because everybody grows the best

92
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:51,750
cannabis and because there isn't a

93
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,819
system or a mechanism to decipher the

94
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,340
differences between the quality of the

95
00:03:53,818 --> 00:04:00,719
units what you're seeing on a wholesale

96
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,908
market is the price per pound for

97
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,090
cannabis that should not be consumed

98
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:08,638
being sold at nearly the same price of

99
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,090
really really high quality product that

100
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,959
is extremely difficult to produce and so

101
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:21,298
there is there is a real big problem

102
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,819
because the high quality producers you

103
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,709
know they deserve to get anywhere

104
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:32,860
between three to maybe even a thousand

105
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:35,228
more per pound but they can't or on the

106
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,810
reverse people who are growing really

107
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:42,129
low quality cannabis stuff that's

108
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:47,079
unflushed unripe has a bunch of you know

109
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:49,180
pesticides on it what have you that

110
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,060
stuff should not be selling for as high

111
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,139
as it is and so we're the only

112
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,889
multi-billion dollar market in the world

113
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:59,918
that has no ability to measure the

114
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:02,348
difference of its quality and so every

115
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,719
head of lettuce in the grocery store and

116
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:07,750
apples and even your medicine your

117
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,470
pharmacy has all been quality verified

118
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:14,649
and checked for your consumer safety and

119
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,180
also for your for your I guess so that

120
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,879
it tastes good too not just being faith

121
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,400
but that is a high quality product and

122
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,050
so it's kind of silly that the cannabis

123
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,719
industry doesn't have anything like that

124
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,699
when at the same time our industry is

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,020
more serious about bragging rights

126
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,120
improving that our cannabis is better

127
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:36,069
than the other persons which is why

128
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,310
we've developed entire cannabis cups

129
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,769
around this and almost this black-market

130
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,218
process of how do you prove to your

131
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:47,319
purchaser that your your cannabis is

132
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:48,908
better than the other guys I can imagine

133
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,439
that would be really important at the

134
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:52,990
wholesale level too right because so

135
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,598
many people are are buying flour and

136
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,848
they are deciding whether or not to you

137
00:05:55,598 --> 00:06:00,430
know put it in a bag for bag appeal or

138
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:02,680
run it into oil because it might be

139
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,689
strong but not very pretty they're doing

140
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,569
that mostly on the opinion of the

141
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,610
producer unless they go and they take a

142
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,439
look at it themselves first person which

143
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,020
is super time-consuming I can imagine

144
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,149
that you know a standard that got picked

145
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:18,579
up throughout the the industry would be

146
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:21,848
pretty much helpful to everybody well it

147
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:24,250
would and and also at the consumer level

148
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:27,370
as well and so in the state of

149
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,990
Washington you're not allowed to see or

150
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,930
smell the cannabis before you purchase

151
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,629
it so you basically get this grab bag

152
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,189
for 50 bucks and you're just praying

153
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:40,480
that is going to be decent yeah and so

154
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:42,550
what the tag

155
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,970
program is as trichome assurance grading

156
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,160
it truly is the world's first and only

157
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,260
cannabis quality certification process

158
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,210
now hold on before you go too far down

159
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:54,399
the tag thing I want to talk I want to

160
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,469
focus on tag more on the second set when

161
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,189
we're talking about you at cannabis cups

162
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,960
okay

163
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,540
let's circle back around first and

164
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,019
because I know that you're using these

165
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,330
these so my a folks these interpreters

166
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:09,759
in the cannabis cup span I first want to

167
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:11,589
set up you know why these interpreters

168
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,509
where they get their skills so let's

169
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:16,959
let's circle back around to like what

170
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:20,079
are your teaching interpreters as the

171
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,359
quality aspects in Flour which makes

172
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:26,439
your your your interpreter your saw my a

173
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,819
program so you know why is that the best

174
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:33,699
standard in the industry

175
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:40,029
sure so interpreting is a cannabis

176
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:42,310
someone yeh ship and in all decadent

177
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:44,859
categories of expertise which would

178
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,439
include wine someone yeas beer cicero

179
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:51,699
pne's cheesemongers coffee cup urge to

180
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:56,040
back with honey errs the majority of

181
00:07:51,699 --> 00:08:01,180
what they're analyzing is one quality

182
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:03,160
and to you know how well does it pair

183
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,290
with another food and so it's about does

184
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,310
it taste good and what does a pair with

185
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:13,210
and interpreting does the same thing but

186
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:16,089
to go so much further way far way more

187
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:18,639
important is you know in the beer

188
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:21,279
industry when you order an IPA you get

189
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,610
an IPA but in the cannabis industry you

190
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:27,069
could order blue dream and not get blue

191
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,990
dream you know nine out of ten times in

192
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,790
Colorado for sure it's the most

193
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,870
counterfeit strain name in our state and

194
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:37,750
in Washington - and so what interpreting

195
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,629
does is in an industry that's as young

196
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,710
as it is with the strain name dilemma

197
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:48,490
and speciation dilemma is it empowers

198
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:51,370
customers and patients to know how their

199
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,310
cannabis will affect them physically

200
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,519
mentally psychotropic ly by being a

201
00:08:54,309 --> 00:09:01,269
able to see and smell the psychotropic

202
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,129
differences within the flower types and

203
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,309
so you know interpreting we really start

204
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:08,019
out in cannabis elementary school where

205
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:11,019
we you know first teach you about the

206
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:13,088
very first cannabis plant ever pituitary

207
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:16,750
Mestral primordial cannabis via cannabis

208
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:19,120
ruderalis and how that easy use created

209
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,009
the indica sativa species and how those

210
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,720
species moved around the planet and how

211
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:24,610
some are drug types and some are hemp

212
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,250
types and we've got both of each and

213
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:31,480
this is why it gets really confusing but

214
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:34,889
then going further the program basically

215
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,420
gets to a point where we analyze that

216
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:42,399
cannabis is a massively hybridized

217
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:46,569
domesticated plant the way that dogs are

218
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:50,139
but in canine form and that it's not a

219
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:52,510
great wolf and it's not a coyote like

220
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:55,389
the original strains or species in the

221
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:58,539
wild so when you go to a pet store you

222
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:01,509
purchase a poodle and that's kind of the

223
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:03,519
same in the cannabis store the flowers

224
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:06,220
are more like poodles than they are like

225
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,720
wolves and coyotes into cousin sativa

226
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,509
because they're so far away from the

227
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,120
land race correct and so what we have is

228
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,639
we have to really analyze cannabis in a

229
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,839
much more intelligent way and

230
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,569
interpreting really helps people to do

231
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,390
that by looking at cannabis in the in

232
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,780
the hybridized spectrum medicine from

233
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:28,960
stimulating to sedating flower types and

234
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:33,129
then we teach you how to use your human

235
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,560
senses to literally use your your fifth

236
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:37,838
cranial nerve your trigeminal nerve in

237
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,029
your face to physically feel the

238
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,800
detection of the vibration of the

239
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,620
terpenes in different parts of your face

240
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:47,079
while simultaneously analyzing their

241
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,269
specific set profiles so that we can

242
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,820
gauge what terpenes are available in

243
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:54,879
what type of pharmacology we know they

244
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,910
produce and then also the shape of the

245
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,769
bud structure the cola itself is

246
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:01,838
dictated by the plant shape and the

247
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:03,939
plant shape is dictated by the geography

248
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,300
and the geography really helps us better

249
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,890
understand what

250
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:10,750
type of psychotropic plant types you

251
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:15,379
started out as and so we really we

252
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:20,000
dissect in class over a hundred flowers

253
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:22,578
that we bring to class visually and with

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,059
our smell with our sense of smell the

255
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:30,799
and we dissect them for their total

256
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:32,539
quality and so you know the trichome

257
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,449
Institute we are at cannabis education

258
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:36,828
company I believe we're the only canvas

259
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:41,060
education company that teaches people

260
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:43,609
about bad weed and you know somebody

261
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:45,528
grows and grows schools or grow books

262
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,970
and competitions and all these things

263
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:50,240
it's always about the best of the best

264
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:53,240
of the best but our our theory is you

265
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,139
don't know what good weed is until you

266
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,230
really understand the intricacies of

267
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:02,480
poor quality cannabis you know a moldy

268
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,730
weed is one of those things like you

269
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,680
know like like male plants right where a

270
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,269
lot of people who are all the way at the

271
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,219
end who are the consumers a lot of them

272
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,560
have never seen a male plant because

273
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,889
there's no reason generally for a male

274
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,019
plant to find its way into into the the

275
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:20,838
food chain for cannabis getting to the

276
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,059
end user and and similarly there's no

277
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,610
reason for moldy weed to be in there as

278
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,379
well it was funny when so about about

279
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,389
three years or so we had a plant go

280
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,309
moldy and you know I just took like six

281
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,828
seconds of video of it and threw it on

282
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,059
my Shango Lowe's YouTube channel and I

283
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:37,278
was shocked that it's like one of the

284
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,588
most popular videos that people watch

285
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,078
just because so many so few people have

286
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:44,839
seen moldy weed and I think that your

287
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,208
point is well made that you know when

288
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,190
you see miraculous flower I mean it kind

289
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,809
of stands out and you know holy crap

290
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,750
this looks good and it smells good I

291
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:56,179
can't wait to to toke it whereas when it

292
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,759
comes to you know you know be and medium

293
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:01,609
grade flour a lot of people don't they

294
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:04,069
haven't seen C D and F to know the

295
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,190
difference between mids and really bad

296
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:12,220
stuff that you shouldn't ingest at all

297
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:15,680
correct and you know interpreting is

298
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,810
it's really serious the way that wine

299
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,929
foam on a ship is serious

300
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:24,948
and so when I teach you how to assess

301
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:28,419
the degree of cannabis age I show you

302
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:33,019
cannabis that's three months six nine

303
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:36,558
twelve fifteen you know two years old

304
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:39,438
and we'll show you the spectrum where

305
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:42,198
we'll teach you that chlorophyll in the

306
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:44,688
bud begins to bleed at the base of the

307
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:48,258
coal of where the stem is and so you can

308
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:50,088
really see the degree of age from the

309
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:52,490
chlorophyll bleeding from the amount of

310
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:55,069
time that it takes as well as the

311
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,289
particular and very specific smell old

312
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:59,208
cannabis produces regardless of the

313
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:01,879
screen or terpene types that it started

314
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,378
out with and so we're really kind of the

315
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:08,528
only place in the world where you can

316
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:12,350
get that hands-on you know smell on

317
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:14,838
lecture expert experience but also with

318
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,350
the molds and unflushed cannabis and

319
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:23,389
cannabis with nutrient lock chemical

320
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:26,600
burn spider mites male flower sights

321
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:28,850
poor trim temp that was harvested early

322
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,189
on purpose to keep the THC levels down I

323
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,620
mean we really bring all of these

324
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:36,049
cannabis samples to class in Denver and

325
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,120
the Denver class is our level two which

326
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:42,099
is the hands-on class that also includes

327
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:45,828
a test so you know after the for our

328
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,490
education and a workshop we give you ten

329
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:51,739
jars of cannabis that are unlabeled and

330
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,129
what the test is is you have one hour to

331
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,829
pick five out of the ten and tell us

332
00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:00,438
what's wrong with those herbs identify

333
00:14:57,828 --> 00:15:03,169
the species of mold or the degree of the

334
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:08,568
un-- flush or what have you and then the

335
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:11,419
other five line them up in order from

336
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:13,099
stimulating to sedating and there's in

337
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:15,409
there's five of them and so when people

338
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,990
can do this when people pass more than

339
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:19,578
eighty percent of their level to test

340
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,459
they become a level two certified

341
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:24,888
interpreter and they get a green pin and

342
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:27,859
we have level two certified interpreters

343
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:30,320
in Canada people have flown in and have

344
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,680
passed from South Africa

345
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,390
Mexico every class we teach we have

346
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,629
people fly in from more than five

347
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,870
different states and multiple countries

348
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:45,159
last class we have people fly in from

349
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:48,289
even the Czech Republic and in Poland

350
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:50,629
yeah I know your classes are jam-packed

351
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:52,519
and I think that one of the aspects of

352
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:53,990
it is that it really is a pilgrimage

353
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,600
right because like I've been wanting to

354
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,279
take your interpreting series myself but

355
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,740
being out here on Vashon Island where I

356
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,139
live I'm a long way away from Denver and

357
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,629
so you know I need to make a specific

358
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:09,199
plan to come to you but really you know

359
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:11,509
even though your class would blow up if

360
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,700
you did it online there's simply no way

361
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:18,350
to do it because the experience of

362
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,180
grading cannabis you have to do it in

363
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:25,279
person because so much of it is based on

364
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:28,039
smell this I mean so yes and no so the

365
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,500
the yes is yes everything that you just

366
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,539
said because it makes perfect sense and

367
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,029
and that's the Denver class and it is a

368
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:37,219
pilgrimage and because people do have to

369
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:40,449
come to us because we can't take a

370
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:44,540
hundred flowers across any border right

371
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:47,629
so unfortunately it's a pilgrimage but

372
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:51,829
the the no part is is the level one that

373
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:53,629
we do and level one is simply people who

374
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,970
are just so excited to learn about

375
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:58,730
interpreting and they want a 3-hour

376
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,920
lecture and the ability to interact with

377
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,080
me in person and ask all the questions

378
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,599
that they want I do

379
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,670
do these level one courses out of state

380
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:11,328
and I just did one at dope magazine's

381
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:14,959
headquarters in Seattle while I was out

382
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:18,230
there judging the dope Cup and we had a

383
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,910
full class for sure and and because I

384
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,779
was judging the cup I had enough

385
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,490
cannabis to actually detect the enough

386
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:27,170
that were different to demonstrate and

387
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,049
show in class some actually poor quality

388
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,509
ones as well as the spectrum in and of

389
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,629
itself so it was kind of like a level

390
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:37,970
one and a half if you will and I will

391
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,010
tell you that you know our interpreting

392
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,259
tools are super fun and awesome they're

393
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,910
colorful and interactive and simple to

394
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:46,400
understand

395
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,800
but the guidebook I've actually started

396
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,800
looking at the idea of scratch and sniff

397
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,430
stickers so if there were people in

398
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:57,529
Australia or the UK who it would just be

399
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,320
a little too extreme to make the

400
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:03,410
pilgrimage that maybe we could in the

401
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:07,460
interpreting you know super kit actually

402
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,050
put vials of live terpenes that will go

403
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,269
along with the guidebook with scratch

404
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:13,269
and sniff stickers so that we can you

405
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:16,009
know if I tell you that the smell of

406
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:19,910
unflushed flower smells like this and

407
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:22,730
you scratch it and it does its better

408
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:25,279
than I guess not having a scratch it's

409
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,900
better than not at all yeah oops but I

410
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,670
think it's scratch and sniff cannabis

411
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,380
somali a book would just be the coolest

412
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,170
thing ever so do you find that there's a

413
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,390
lot of variability in the terpenes that

414
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,460
different people's noses can pick up

415
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,690
just like with wine different people's

416
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:44,390
palates can pick up different notes so

417
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:47,000
yes absolutely and i am i'm

418
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,340
unfortunately too busy to do so many

419
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,059
things in life but one thing that i need

420
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:57,230
to get around at doing is testing myself

421
00:18:53,059 --> 00:19:00,440
as a super taster and I've ordered my

422
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:04,069
kit so I do have the super taster tester

423
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,559
kit which is really fun to say

424
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:09,710
and apparently there's this this

425
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,740
chemical way to analyze if you are a

426
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,779
part of a small population of humans on

427
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,559
earth who have an ability to taste

428
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:21,259
things much greater than other people

429
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:22,940
and I I do have lots of people tell me

430
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:24,619
that one reason why they're concerned

431
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,240
that they don't want to come to class is

432
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:30,169
because they have a really poor sense of

433
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,730
smell and you know I just asked them how

434
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,560
much do you care about passing your test

435
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,150
versus learning all of the information

436
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:37,069
about what cannabis is where it comes

437
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:40,400
from how it works and how to identify

438
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:42,109
it's qualitative features maybe that's

439
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,200
better than you being able to smell so

440
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:48,199
class is still important but I think the

441
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,170
most interesting thing the thing that's

442
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,850
the craziest part of interpreting and

443
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,670
the thing that needs more science and

444
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:58,579
more research is

445
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,440
where you feel the smell in the

446
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:03,500
different parts of your face and so I'm

447
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,529
the I still have never seen anybody in

448
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,529
the world publish any type of media or

449
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:11,500
content or literature or video or

450
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:14,180
anything around the idea that this is

451
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,569
something that is true and happens and

452
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,970
it's possible and I've been doing this

453
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:22,669
since I was a young kid and now I teach

454
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:26,480
this to people and it is extremely

455
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:29,090
accurate that stimulating terpene types

456
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,220
are felt on the atomic part of the

457
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:33,769
trigeminal nerve which is the top of the

458
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:38,240
nose in between your eyes whereas

459
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:41,289
sedating and heavier physically heavier

460
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,839
live hydrocarbon chains isomers terpenes

461
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:48,289
deeper richer rounder more robust

462
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:50,629
chocolates leathers tobacco's that you

463
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:53,960
really the sit in in the lower part of

464
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,390
your nostril and is felt there are

465
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,809
really sedative dominant variety types

466
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:03,530
and so it's this totally crazy thing

467
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:05,539
because whether it's cannabis or not 99%

468
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,849
of everybody I show this to says I've

469
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:09,500
never in my life even known that my nose

470
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,299
could smell at different parts of my

471
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,940
nose like I've never even realized that

472
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:17,659
and so when you come to class you know

473
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,640
not only do you see the qualitative

474
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,680
features the botanical elements of the

475
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,230
flower that are consistent with their

476
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,990
quote unquote sativa indica

477
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,610
in reality it's more like narrow leaf

478
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,970
drug types that are stimulating

479
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:33,679
broadleaf drug types that are sedating

480
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:36,470
do have these consistent correlations

481
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,900
within them and where things get complex

482
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:42,500
is the fact that these are all hybrids

483
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:47,620
and so there's a ton of crossover and so

484
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:51,079
it is unbelievably particular in

485
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:56,119
miniscule and just what we're analyzing

486
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:58,449
is the most subtle of visual differences

487
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:02,359
smell differences and taste differences

488
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:05,090
extremely extremely subtle and yes some

489
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:08,599
people are much better at seeing and

490
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:11,389
smelling these subtle features than

491
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:13,129
and most other people right on so when

492
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,720
we get back from the first commercial

493
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,080
break we are going to talk about how you

494
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,329
and your team of interpreters are kind

495
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,730
of remaking the competitive nature of

496
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:25,069

your host Shango Louis and our guest

561
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,519
this week is max Montrose founder and

562
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:01,900
president of the trichome Institute so

563
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,349
before the break we were talking about

564
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:08,140
what interpreting is and what all the

565
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:11,289
variable quality data points are when

566
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:14,320
truly looking at cannabis flower and

567
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:16,269
judging its quality so during the second

568
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,970
set we're going to talk about very

569
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:21,970
specifically how these skills are being

570
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,829
cross applied to judging cannabis cups

571
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,049
so you know cannabis cups have been

572
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:27,849
ridiculed since the very beginning for

573
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:30,250
you know everything from taking bribes

574
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:32,230
to influence results or simply giving

575
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,940
awards to their friends and it's pretty

576
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,490
much ruined the reputation of most

577
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,950
competitions in response to that you

578
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:41,589
have begun teaching cup event promoters

579
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:44,470
in alternative judging methods that are

580
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:47,439
based much more on botany and data

581
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,720
points instead of just the judges

582
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,430
personal preference why is this system

583
00:25:49,720 --> 00:26:01,180
better than traditional cannabis coach

584
00:25:51,430 --> 00:26:03,250
cup judging panels okay so so yeah let's

585
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,840
let's just let's talk about I guess

586
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:11,289
cannabis cups when describing this so if

587
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:14,470
if you put in a product in a traditional

588
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:17,379
let's just say cup they're really

589
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:20,170
expensive and the competition is serious

590
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:22,900
and the reward is really meaningful

591
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:25,240
because in this industry being able to

592
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,970
prove that your product is better than

593
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,309
the next guys is your best method of

594
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,110
marketing and advertising specifically

595
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:37,940
in this industry and many other

596
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:40,879
but so so it's important and so these

597
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:43,400
judges and their judgments are making or

598
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,360
breaking multi-million dollar businesses

599
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:51,350
and that's important too that's a big

600
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:53,750
deal and the people who deserve to win

601
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:56,349
these things it's important to celebrate

602
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:59,269
they're they're really hard efforts

603
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:03,379
because it takes more than a decade to

604
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:06,410
have the types of skills to win cups and

605
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,960
if people are if the way that we're

606
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,360
judging them isn't accurate and ensuring

607
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,730
that those who deserve to win win then

608
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:17,240
we're celebrating people who we

609
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,710
shouldn't be and promoting more poor

610
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,298
quality products in cannabis in the

611
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,730
industry so all of this is really

612
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:24,230
important stuff and so what you're

613
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,829
starting out with is who are these

614
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:32,360
judges and what are their qualifications

615
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:34,730
for judging and I'm not going to name

616
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,250
any names but I'll just say the largest

617
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,890
and probably oldest cannabis magazine

618
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,740
that we're all familiar with you can

619
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:45,500
actually pay to be a judge a thousand

620
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,880
bucks so if your parents have enough

621
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,069
money and you want to prove to your

622
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,190
friends that you're super cool we now

623
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:54,319
have you know people who have who don't

624
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:57,500
even know what trichomes are don't even

625
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,990
know what a calyx is who think that the

626
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,179
the male antler is called a banana on

627
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,519
cannabis those are the people who are

628
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:06,769
now going to determine whether your

629
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,500
business deserves to be rewarded or not

630
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:11,480
and put in the scene right and so and if

631
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,329
it's not those people then it's really

632
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,759
qualified industry people right and when

633
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:18,980
you ask what is really qualified mean it

634
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,960
mean live grown cannabis a few times and

635
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:25,099
they smoked it for five years it's like

636
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,919
okay do you study technical textbooks on

637
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:29,418
cannabis and and all of these

638
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,460
intricacies and what you find is that

639
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:35,390
most people just aren't as dorky and

640
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:37,519
nerdy as people who kind of work at the

641
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,280
trichome Institute and who put together

642
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,569
a lot of this of these data points in

643
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,710
these text books that we produce

644
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:46,759
ourselves and so what we've done is in

645
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,619
terms of starting out

646
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:52,278
with who the judges are you have to be a

647
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:55,968
really qualified judge and so you have

648
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:59,169
to be an interpreter level 3 and so you

649
00:28:55,969 --> 00:29:02,379
have to be able to dissect and analyze

650
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:05,479
cannabis quality in a psychotropic

651
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:07,519
spectrum in less than five minutes

652
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:10,308
whereas the level 2 test which is the

653
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,169
same test is an hour and you have to

654
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:13,908
demonstrate that in multiple ways but

655
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:16,309
you also have to learn the standard

656
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:19,389
operating procedure of our grading scale

657
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:22,428
for concentrates and also things like

658
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:25,939
trichome ripeness trichome density and

659
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:29,089
then learning the the subtle spectrum

660
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,828
that really takes a in person teacher to

661
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:34,638
teach you what like the degree of

662
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:37,698
pungency is you know that is something

663
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:40,008
you can't learn online you have to spend

664
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:43,399
critical time with someone and we've

665
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:45,679
spent hours and hours and hours doing

666
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:47,478
this with each other and so literally at

667
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,788
the dope cup when there was four

668
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:54,169
sometimes five six of us in Terpening

669
00:29:51,788 --> 00:30:01,878
utilizing the tag program to do these

670
00:29:54,169 --> 00:30:03,979
judging's it's it's it's just it's

671
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:05,058
unbelievable how much time it takes us

672
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:06,379
we're up to like two or three in the

673
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:08,509
morning doing this but the amount of

674
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:10,728
hours that we put in checking each

675
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:12,828
other's work in cross comparing our

676
00:30:10,729 --> 00:30:16,909
evaluations to make sure that they fall

677
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:20,088
within our parameters of inter-rater

678
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:20,659
reliability is intense it's really

679
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:22,428
intense

680
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:25,399
wonder what are some of the data points

681
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:28,729
that you as interpreters are looking at

682
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:30,858
versus what a normal judge would I mean

683
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:33,348
we've obviously established that you

684
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:35,689
know a sommelier level interpreter of

685
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:37,668
cannabis has got more experience and

686
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,639
have studied it more than the average

687
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,379
cannabis judge but but I also believe

688
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,428
that your system is going to be

689
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:45,408
different because you know I've seen

690
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:46,879
some judging packets and some of the

691
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:48,379
judging packets you know where they're

692
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:51,228
where they're doing the ratings they

693
00:30:48,378 --> 00:30:53,478
seem pretty fluffy to me and you know I

694
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:56,450
know that you approach this from such a

695
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:57,588
scientific and botanical background that

696
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,298
I would think that some of the data

697
00:30:57,588 --> 00:31:00,500
points that you are looking at are

698
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:03,920
different than tradition

699
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:08,119
judging one way couple of those be super

700
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:11,180
good question so so for those who don't

701
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:16,669
know tag it's a computer program that we

702
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:20,060
built and it's a calculator and what

703
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:22,940
it's doing is it's calculating numeric

704
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:27,440
values that level three interpreters are

705
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:31,490
giving to a variety of different visual

706
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:35,240
olfactory and consumption data points

707
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,620
and so you know in most traditional cups

708
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,660
everything is subjective

709
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:41,029
it's whatever that person thinks they

710
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:46,279
like and usually they're liking it

711
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:49,279
intoxicated right and so this program

712
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:56,389
everything is analyzed in the exact same

713
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:59,329
way double-blind twice and I guess some

714
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:04,160
of the big biggest differences of our

715
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:10,369
data points is we do the entire grading

716
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:13,040
and calculation sober until we're done

717
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:16,189
producing all the report cards and then

718
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,759
it comes the consumption aspect of the

719
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,950
judging

720
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:22,160
so we're judging all of your products

721
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:24,140
sober 90 95 percent of the judging is

722
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,640
done sober and that's one of the biggest

723
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,570
differences between the way that we

724
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:32,570
judge in other in other cups but you

725
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:35,569
know we smoke cannabis we get down we're

726
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:39,349
not just nerds we can puff tough and we

727
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:42,129
do and so you know you have to be able

728
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:43,369
to judge the consumption because it's

729
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,340
unbelievable

730
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:49,519
how tricky cannabis can look it can look

731
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:53,359
gorgeous it can look and actually have

732
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,430
ripe erect trichomes that have really

733
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,250
pungent terpenes and everything about

734
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,950
that flower just looks sexy and then you

735
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:04,069
take a hit and you're just coughing your

736
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:07,039
brains out and your chest feels like hot

737
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:10,039
spider webs and it's because this person

738
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,079
didn't flush the bud at all and so all

739
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:14,148
of the nutrients and chemicals of the

740
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,759
six months going into this plan

741
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:19,308
our is what you're smoking and so it

742
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:21,108
looks ripe because it is and it smells

743
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:22,848
good probably because it's in a

744
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:25,298
defensive mode because it's so sick

745
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:28,128
internally and you can't really see that

746
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:30,588
and so when we're like judging the

747
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:32,838
degree of the flush it's kind of like

748
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:35,269
how wine someone yeas take a sip of wine

749
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:38,749
and spit it out we don't we call it the

750
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:40,638
Clinton the only time you know anybody

751
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:45,229
would ever ingest cannabis and not

752
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:47,358
inhale it Bill Clinton so so sometimes

753
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:49,848
there's there's a Clinton effect

754
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:53,168
especially when you know we're judging

755
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:56,778
dozens and dozens and dozens of

756
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:57,829
concentrates and flowers that we can we

757
00:33:56,778 --> 00:33:59,239
can look at the report and

758
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:02,298
mathematically we know they're not going

759
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:05,209
to win versus the other you know huge

760
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:07,999
lumps and groups where okay these 25 to

761
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:10,278
30 people one of these guys is going to

762
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:13,240
win we'll definitely bring that entire

763
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:16,699
hit into our lungs and feel the the

764
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:19,758
entirety of it down our throat the

765
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:22,759
intensity of the heat how much it makes

766
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:25,730
our glands swell the degree of the salt

767
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:29,809
on the side of our mouth you know how

768
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:32,480
thick is my saliva we really I mean we

769
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:34,909
look at the ash I mean we really analyze

770
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,809
every piece and like I said double-blind

771
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:43,210
twice and so probably that's probably

772
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:45,470
the other biggest biggest part of the

773
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:50,659
difference between the way we judge and

774
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:54,618
other people is we utilize a system that

775
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:58,880
transfers the subjective into the

776
00:34:54,619 --> 00:35:01,789
objective and the system is inter-rater

777
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,720
reliability and essentially what that

778
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:10,039
means is I keep saying double-blind

779
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:14,659
twice you know one dope magazine gives

780
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:19,460
us all of the samples without any strain

781
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:20,989
name or grower dispensary operation so

782
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,449
we literally just get a bag with a

783
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:28,139
number on it so we're not allowed to

784
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:29,969
have any bias and we we don't know

785
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:35,489
you know the species or the strain name

786
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:38,969
right and then once we do our grading we

787
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:40,679
go through our process the grades the

788
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:43,169
reports are then matched against each

789
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:46,828
other's two other people and those

790
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:49,528
grades have to be within three points of

791
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:52,170
each other out of a hundred so I'm going

792
00:35:49,528 --> 00:35:53,849
to tell you I'm going to tell you this

793
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,400
really incredible thing that happened at

794
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:58,289
the cup that we didn't expect to happen

795
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,239
actually there's a lot of that we can

796
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:03,289
tell you some funny stories - about some

797
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:08,278
of the cannabis we found of crazy stuff

798
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:12,960
but we had no idea that five different

799
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:16,380
cup entries were from these companies

800
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,298
took their best flower and divided it

801
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,119
into two different categories but it was

802
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:22,440
the same flower and nobody told us this

803
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,028
right because we're not allowed to know

804
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,769
anything right double-blind right and so

805
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:31,048
outside of our cannabis quality

806
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:32,758
certification there's a lab that does

807
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:34,739
the lab analysis and that's something we

808
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:38,369
should also talk about is why the tag

809
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:41,130
process is actually does do a quality

810
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:44,789
analysis overall mandated lab prophecies

811
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:47,278
in all medical states in retail that's a

812
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:49,710
big deal but the point is is this lab

813
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:52,498
did the chemo typing so the cannabinoid

814
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:55,048
terpene analysis and the reports were

815
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:57,058
identical for the five flowers that were

816
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:59,699
divided in two categories so a total of

817
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:03,150
10 buds and so when we learned that this

818
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:04,949
happened we were all like oh [ __ ] like

819
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:08,940
this is going to be the ultimate test

820
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:13,259
how well did we did we do and

821
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:16,980
essentially the analogy for this is put

822
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:21,179
looking at a splatter painting in asking

823
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:24,028
two people to guess the the number

824
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:25,649
between 1 and 100 that they feel this

825
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:29,639
painting deserves from a quality

826
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:32,220
perspective so is it an 87 was it a 64

827
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,618
and so that's what we're doing we're

828
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:36,629
taking two people and we're looking at a

829
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,180
piece of cannabis under a microscope and

830
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,760
it looks like a splatter painting right

831
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:43,589
and all

832
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,870
I have samples that were divided twice

833
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,960
we got within our three points of each

834
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:50,670
other and that also says a lot about how

835
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,400
you are training these interpreters

836
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,930
right because you know you know we need

837
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,630
to have the human element because we

838
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:59,399
want to you know truly be able to judge

839
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,860
the different terpenes and how they

840
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,170
blend and how they impact a human but at

841
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,030
the same size the same at the same time

842
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,460
we want to make sure that everybody is

843
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,720
judging using the same standards and so

844
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,579
the fact that you've got these different

845
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,500
samples and different interpreters and

846
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,730
yet they're still coming you know within

847
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,650
three percent of each other

848
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,570
is you know it's pretty it's pretty

849
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,800
amazing now hey well I've got one more

850
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:22,200
question I want to ask before we go to

851
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,590
break here so you know you're bringing

852
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:27,539
in this whole new way of judging cups

853
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,570
and it's going to it's going to you know

854
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:33,029
push out people paying to be judges

855
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,800
which is an income stream and it's going

856
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,600
to push out you know friends of the

857
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,610
promoter who got to be a judge because

858
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,130
they you know they're owed a favor or

859
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:44,700
something and so you know this this will

860
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:47,010
really remake the cup scene you know to

861
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:51,269
what degree have you had you know

862
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:53,220
acceptance by a promoters and be people

863
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:55,309
who are competing because I can I bet

864
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:57,179
you that there's people on both sides

865
00:38:55,309 --> 00:39:00,179
yeah oh man

866
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:03,629
I mean it's trust me it's not an easy

867
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:07,289
thing to to explain to someone that

868
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:09,450
they're going to pay you to grade their

869
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:13,529
weed and then tell the world what you

870
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:15,779
found although we don't tell the world

871
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:18,360
what we find we keep everything coded so

872
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,450
if we do find bad product we don't

873
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:24,000
publish that so we're never going to put

874
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:25,859
anybody's down okay

875
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,409
and I think that's a good thing to start

876
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:32,010
with the tag program and then you know

877
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:35,579
here's the thing

878
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:38,580
I don't really in terms of the revenue

879
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:42,989
stream of the for the companies that

880
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:45,630
have paid judges tell you what instead

881
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:48,209
of making money off of ensuring that

882
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:51,900
your cup is going to be completely

883
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:53,970
inaccurate and probably pissing off all

884
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,660
of the people who are paying you to have

885
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:59,038
their samples judged in the first

886
00:39:55,659 --> 00:40:01,000
place and you know giving your cup

887
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,549
legitimacy

888
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,250
why don't you do education and training

889
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:08,349
programs associated with your cup to

890
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:11,769
teach the public and the consumers and

891
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:13,750
other growers what cannabis really is

892
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:16,750
where it comes from how it helps people

893
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:19,210
and develop a revenue stream based off

894
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,679
of producing more education for the

895
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,900
people who are going to these cups

896
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,699
no matter I get this right you and I are

897
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,530
both cannabis nerds and I get that but

898
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:28,868
really the heart of the question though

899
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,309
is our promoters digging this or not I

900
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:32,619
mean that's really where I want to take

901
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:34,420
this are they going oh yeah I want to do

902
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:36,280
this or people pushing back and saying I

903
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,838
don't want your science so this is

904
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,599
working out good for us what are you

905
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,969
seeing so I mean so here's what we're

906
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:46,079
seeing we're seeing that the majority of

907
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:49,000
cannabis producers don't produce that

908
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,650
that high quality of product there are

909
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,949
fewer producers that produce high

910
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:57,099
quality products right so by default

911
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:59,108
there are majority of people who would

912
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:01,240
probably prefer a system that was less

913
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:03,759
accurate because they might have higher

914
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:06,429
chances of winning right but at the same

915
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,829
time people who really care about the

916
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:11,348
industry and who get what the tag

917
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:13,809
program can bring to cannabis really

918
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:18,640
really love it and truly respect it and

919
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:20,950
really embrace it and so you know when I

920
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,440
was in Oregon and I judged the dope Cup

921
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:26,649
in October the amount of growers who

922
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,088
came up to me just pissed as [ __ ] just

923
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,430
you know who do you think you are

924
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:32,288
grading our weed judging our weed you're

925
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:34,239
not even from our state you don't know

926
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:37,869
anything right I mean it was a lot of

927
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:39,699
people and I just sat down and I just

928
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:42,068
said look I'm going to explain you how I

929
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:44,288
do this before you start hating on me

930
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:47,139
and when I just explained to them how it

931
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:49,630
works they all just flipped the switch

932
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:51,489
instantly and said thank you for doing

933
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:53,559
this this is what our industry is needed

934
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:55,298
you know where have you been the whole

935
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:58,599
time and now I'm really good friends

936
00:41:55,298 --> 00:42:01,000
with these growers and so you know dope

937
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:03,490
magazine has embraced it more than any

938
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,679
other companies so far but other

939
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:07,838
companies who do cannabis competitions

940
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,559
have started you know asking us about

941
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:09,909
the program

942
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,690
but you know they kind of run their

943
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:16,089
competition in their own way so I would

944
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:18,220
say that a lot of producers and

945
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,440
promoters really appreciate the fact

946
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:22,539
that there is a real competition and

947
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,760
that it's possible and people who

948
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:26,860
deserve to win are winning and that it's

949
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:31,270
fair and that it's even so even if you

950
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:32,500
lose at least it wasn't because you know

951
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:35,769
some stoner who didn't know what they

952
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:38,019
were doing about created your cannabis

953
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:39,400
and you lost because of that at least it

954
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:41,170
you know you can go back and analyze

955
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,990
your report and compare it to other

956
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,720
peoples and learn why you didn't win and

957
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:48,609
improve yourself from it that's that's

958
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:50,230
what's happening and similarly it

959
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,370
creates a paper trail so that people

960
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,289
aren't feeling like they're losing

961
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:55,119
because there was a you know special

962
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:56,889
donation made behind the scenes which

963
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,690
cannabis cups are constantly being

964
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:00,400
charged with so hey we're going to go to

965
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,809
our second break and rewrite back you

966
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,150
are listening to shaping fire and my

967
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:06,969
guest today is max Montrose founder of

968
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,769
the trichome Institute businesses

969
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:10,599
everywhere are constantly striving to

970
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:12,460
reach out to people through advertising

971
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,110
we all know though that trying to reach

972
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,269
a cannabis audience with a quality

973
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,920
message is pretty difficult that's why

974
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:20,889
many people choose to advertise on the

975
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,840
shaping fire podcast advertising on this

976
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,909
show allows us time to talk about your

977
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,680
product service or brand in a way that

978
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:29,049
really lets people know what sets your

979
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:31,000
company apart from others bold people

980
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,500
who own companies know that getting in a

981
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,619
relationship with their customers is

982
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,809
essential that is what we offer we will

983
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:40,269
explain your service or product and what

984
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:42,460
sets it apart as desirable and help our

985
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:43,590
audience get in contact with you it's

986
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,400
pretty simple really

987
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,400
advertising does not have to be all

988
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,990
whiz-bang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

989
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,690
find that people prefer just to be

990
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:54,969
spoken to calmly accurately and with

991
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,789
good intentions if you want to make your

992
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:59,859
own commercial spot you can do that too

993
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:01,840
because the podcast is young but growing

994
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,940
at an exceptionally fast rate if you

995
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,039
become an advertiser on the shaping fire

996
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,809
podcast now you are going to pay a

997
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:10,179
fraction of the cost we'd be asking for

998
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:12,460
in just a few months and yet everyone

999
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:14,769
listening both now and to the back

1000
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,720
catalog of interviews later will hear

1001
00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:19,420
about your company again and again for

1002
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,579
years it's a great deal for you pay a

1003
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,090
small amount now because the show is new

1004
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:23,739
but

1005
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:26,320
take advantage of the huge listening

1006
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:28,029

welcome back you are listening to

1012
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,750
shaping fire I'm your host Shango lows

1013
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:42,820
and our guest this week is max Montrose

1014
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:45,519
founder and president of the trichome

1015
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,080
Institute so before we wrap up here max

1016
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,539
you know you've alluded a couple times

1017
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:52,509
to these unexpected stories that you

1018
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:54,610
have come across while grading cannabis

1019
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:56,590
at cannabis cups and you know most

1020
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:58,690
probably everybody who's listening has

1021
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,640
either been interested in attended or

1022
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,110
which they attended a cup so why don't

1023
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,089
you like kind of bring a lot of this

1024
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,950
science home for us and tell us a couple

1025
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,900
of these outlier funny stories that

1026
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:09,609
you've been alluding to to kind of make

1027
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:15,010
us feel like we've been sitting in your

1028
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:19,360
seat sure so you know we just got back

1029
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:21,670
from the Seattle dope cup you know the

1030
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,260
edible category it's an interesting one

1031
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,180
to judge and we don't have too much time

1032
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,390
so I'm not going to go into how we get

1033
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:30,339
into the technicalities of judging that

1034
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:32,829
but it's really unbelievable how

1035
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,450
delicious and awesome the amount of

1036
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:36,849
edible products are it's just

1037
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:39,669
mind-blowing how just fantastic almost

1038
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:42,309
all of them are up until the point where

1039
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,690
you get you know some companies who I'm

1040
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:46,389
not going to mention the type of drink

1041
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,490
but I'm not kidding we were literally

1042
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:50,109
spitting some of the stuff out the sink

1043
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:51,909
left and right and as judges trying to

1044
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:55,539
get each other to like drink it as a

1045
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:57,759
joke it just it's just unbelievable you

1046
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:59,860
know some of those just wild cards that

1047
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,860
that pop in there but more more than the

1048
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:06,010
drink in all of those drinks from that

1049
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:09,910
company was one of these flowers that

1050
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:12,880
was entered in the THC category which is

1051
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:15,670
generally judged for the highest THC but

1052
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,660
not always because we're judging quality

1053
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:24,670
and pH C doesn't equate to quality and

1054
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:27,309
so we come across this bud and we have

1055
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:29,349
we were we've literally been we've never

1056
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:31,869
been so astonished by a piece of flower

1057
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:33,099
in our lives and on the report which

1058
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:35,650
we're going to publish on our website

1059
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:37,409
soon it literally says this is the word

1060
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:40,690
piece of cannabis we've ever seen ever

1061
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:43,089
and it smells like a Glade plugin and

1062
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:46,119
smells like just raw chemicals it's

1063
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,829
brown and it disintegrates in a dust in

1064
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:49,449
your hand and when you look at the

1065
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:53,529
trichomes under the microscope they're

1066
00:46:49,449 --> 00:46:56,949
like really Arnon and there are looks

1067
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:59,170
like bugs and fecal matter as well as a

1068
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:01,659
lot of these black weird things we can't

1069
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:05,309
identify and dust particles and other

1070
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:08,230
things and so it was literally like I

1071
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:10,750
can't even describe no analogy for how

1072
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:12,130
what what the thing was but it was

1073
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:16,300
really interesting because when you get

1074
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:20,590
the HPLC report from the lab this is a

1075
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:24,700
flower that has 47 percent THC get out

1076
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:27,579
for dayavan percent 47 percent that

1077
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:29,980
leaves me skeptical man hold on hold

1078
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:31,960
your horses shame so we look around at

1079
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,909
each other and we're just like what the

1080
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,699
heck is this like how is this possible

1081
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:39,609
exclusive what is this and we talked to

1082
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:42,519
the lab and they just said they're like

1083
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:46,470
look obviously somebody soaked this

1084
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:49,809
flower in hash oil and whatever

1085
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:52,029
chemically hash oil that was more you

1086
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:54,460
know viscous than not has to be more

1087
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:56,890
like water probably had some chemical on

1088
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,380
it that is why it smells like a Glade

1089
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:01,449
plugin but you know we're looking at the

1090
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,160
thing and that that is what they did so

1091
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:06,059
they they thought that they were going

1092
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:08,619
to win first place for the highest THC

1093
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:11,799
because essentially they cheated by

1094
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:13,420
soaking a flower in THC oil that's like

1095
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,430
the next level compared to people who

1096
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,559
would roll their flowers and Keith you

1097
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:19,359
know before submitting them yeah yeah

1098
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:22,360
and then and tried to hide that they did

1099
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,610
this because like it wasn't like sticky

1100
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,620
hash oil on the bud you couldn't see the

1101
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,480
oil just the flower but the flower was

1102
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:30,369
like tan and brown and smelled horrible

1103
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,920
and disintegrated like I said but

1104
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:34,989
anyways long story short we were just

1105
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:39,340
like you think you're going to win first

1106
00:48:34,989 --> 00:48:41,439
place annihilated it said you know we

1107
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,260
just don't appreciate I hope you don't

1108
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,059
sell this like to the public I hope this

1109
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,710
isn't really a product that you make and

1110
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,549
that this is more of like a joke and

1111
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,559
your attempt

1112
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,390
to try to win a cannabis cup because at

1113
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,739
the end of the day it's not funny like

1114
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:55,239
that was some of the most disgusting

1115
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:58,239
[ __ ] we've ever seen and it was

1116
00:48:55,239 --> 00:49:00,399
offensive it was bad but I'll tell you

1117
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:04,269
but on a good note to end on a positive

1118
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,789
note because we're aggregating data in

1119
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:08,429
the way that we are we have an

1120
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:12,340
opportunity where we're literally

1121
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:16,089
analyzing the collectiveness of what

1122
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:19,120
makes Oregon cannabis Oregon cannabis

1123
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:21,880
what makes Colorado cannabis Colorado

1124
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,519
cannabis and these are different almost

1125
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,380
like countrywide Appalachians and then

1126
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:28,150
within those there are terroir and so

1127
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:32,710
this really is an interpreting someone

1128
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:37,349
yay analysis but at a state level and we

1129
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:41,710
were just completely blown away

1130
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:44,500
fascinated and also quickly bored by the

1131
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:47,530
fact that 98 percent of every flower we

1132
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:50,590
smelled in the competition smelled like

1133
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:53,040
a diesel every one every single one was

1134
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:56,800
gorilla glue number four or Sour Diesel

1135
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,690
these are really high in terpene alene a

1136
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,150
gas like smell that produces a really

1137
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:02,500
racy kind of high affect fuels are

1138
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,880
really popular around here

1139
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,130
especially since we have a hard time

1140
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,579
getting them right because a lot of the

1141
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:12,880
Northwest is indicas you know well so

1142
00:50:09,579 --> 00:50:17,019
the thing is is I was talking with the

1143
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:20,829
gentleman who works in the area and what

1144
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:25,269
he said was really intelligent which was

1145
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:29,259
a lot of the diesel varietals for

1146
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:32,980
whatever reason have been known to not

1147
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,640
have to resist molds better than other

1148
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,570
strains

1149
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:40,599
and so because Seattle and in that area

1150
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:44,050
is just covered in water and rain and

1151
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:46,119
wetness all the time that there's really

1152
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:48,280
a majority of a type of strain that has

1153
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,109
a better chance of surviving and it

1154
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,840
happens to be these high core pinna lean

1155
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:55,539
diesel-like varietals

1156
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:58,240
and so the geography in the you know the

1157
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:01,789
requirement to have mold resistant

1158
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:03,769
strains in that that geography

1159
00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:06,349
is important and if that's the case

1160
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:09,920
that's what we analyzed looking at over

1161
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:12,319
200 flour samples literally 98% of them

1162
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,420
smelled almost identical they were all

1163
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,220
just different little subtle versions of

1164
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,800
diesel diesel these when I got bored

1165
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:20,419
quick but but it was really interesting

1166
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,010
it's really fascinating

1167
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,869
yeah that really is interesting I had

1168
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,580
not considered that because you know a

1169
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:27,409
lot of times we don't get sativa around

1170
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:29,150
here just simply because if the grown

1171
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:31,099
indoor people don't want to spend the

1172
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:33,470
extra light hours to finish the sativa

1173
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:35,690
and good luck finishing a sativa outdoor

1174
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:37,099
anywhere here in the northwest but that

1175
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,960
makes sense because if they've got if

1176
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:41,719
they're naturally resistant to mold

1177
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:45,500
people will certainly keep the lights on

1178
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:47,209
longer for that yeah Yeah right on cool

1179
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,730
well I know that you could probably do

1180
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:51,470
an entire show just on the same topic

1181
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:52,639
again but our time is up for today

1182
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:53,989
what's we're going to have you back

1183
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:57,289
another time in a few weeks though to

1184
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:59,779
talk about the very interesting stories

1185
00:51:57,289 --> 00:52:02,449
that you've got to share about beating

1186
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,490
cannabis duis and how you're being flown
