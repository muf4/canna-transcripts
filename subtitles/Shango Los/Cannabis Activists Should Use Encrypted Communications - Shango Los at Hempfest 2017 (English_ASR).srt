1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,490
one thing I want to point out is that

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,029
you know social media like Facebook is a

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,620
really great way to recruit people

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,029
because you can find them so easily but

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,859
I also want to encourage you that if

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:15,808
you're gonna found your own organization

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,000
as soon as you've started to recruit

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,608
your people and you start doing planning

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,670
for events get off Facebook because

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,368
Facebook is not protected speech and the

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,929
the statements that you make in private

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,768
communications are not in any way

13
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:33,960
private um get yourself some you know

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:36,299
encryption right start using an app like

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,829
signal on your phone so your

16
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,539
conversations with other people that

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,579
you're organizing with are encrypted and

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,649
is something that the NSA cannot get

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,140
their hands on start to use a mailing

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,120
list like and rise up so that you know

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,659
that your archives are being encrypted

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,909
and and preserved um even though we

23
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,679
enjoy a lot of Liberty here in

24
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,029
Washington I'm working with people all

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,119
the time across the country who are in

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,219
states like Idaho and and you are still

27
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,429
targets and we're still targets here in

28
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,079
Washington so err on the safe side do

29
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,820
your recruiting with something like

30
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,500
Facebook or Twitter but then when you

31
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,219
start bringing together core members

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,219
transition
