1
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:19,879
all right welcome everyone to the panel

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,368
so this panel is using microbes in

3
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,618
cannabis cultivation harnessing the

4
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:28,099
power of nature to enhance crop

5
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:30,618
productivity we have Colin Bell who is

6
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:34,399
the co-founder and chief growth officer

7
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:37,189
at gross sentía Shango votes who is the

8
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,399
host of shaping fire and we have the

9
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:43,250
Nate Chevallier founder of moon time

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,410
medicinals so before we get officially

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,869
started here I just want to let everyone

12
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,959
know that we are going to be doing a Q&amp;A

13
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:53,059
at the end of the session the cannabis

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,219
Business Summit has an app putting

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,410
download so it's just a cannabis

16
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,259
Business Summit Expo app from your App

17
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:02,509
Store you just tap the schedule if the

18
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:05,088
menu once it's downloaded you find this

19
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:07,129
session you can just type in microbes

20
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:08,629
and it'll come up right away and then at

21
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:11,929
the very bottom you're gonna scroll down

22
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:14,060
to the session Q&amp;A and you can submit

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,680
your questions there so you can also you

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,409
know as you're thinking about things as

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,120
they're you know as your brain juices

26
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,700
are flowing if you see something pops up

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,680
right away you can submit it at that

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,870
time and then when we start the Q&amp;A I'll

29
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,729
try to get to as many questions as

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:35,240
possible

31
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:38,209
all right so Nate Chevalier founder of

32
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:41,000
mid time' decimals when Nate experienced

33
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:43,939
intensity of kind but for the first time

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,819
in Des Moines Iowa his world changed

35
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:49,069
suddenly he became aware of a new world

36
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:52,399
of herb that raised the bar for quality

37
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:55,069
and experience while making ends meet

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,260
after moving to San Francisco it was

39
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,798
able to make connections that ultimately

40
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,810
led him to move to Humboldt County in

41
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,930
2006 on his path towards living off the

42
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,179
land and growing the best cannabis

43
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,560
freedom medicine the cannabis culture

44
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:14,990
inspired him after youth spent in a very

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,479
conventional agricultural setting they

46
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,480
quickly recognized the contrast between

47
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:24,139
food produced for quantity rather than

48
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:26,509
quality versus the simple rich flavor of

49
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:30,739
food and cannabis grown in an organic

50
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:33,409
setting inspired by his desire to learn

51
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,689
how to live on this raw piece of land

52
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:39,859
they received a permaculture design

53
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:42,669
certification in 2004 and continued his

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,890
education at college of the Redwoods

55
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:47,869
receiving a certificate in solar PV

56
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:54,039
installation and solar thermal

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:56,509
installation in 2016 this education has

58
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,120
guided him to leading a sustainable

59
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,979
living on his farm he is currently

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,560
focused on implementing more water

61
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:06,439
saving techniques such as huge rubicon

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,229
surrounds that build soil producing

63
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,719
plastic inputs and pouring chemicals by

64
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:14,780

biological chemical and physical

138
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,270
characteristics of soils were measured

to elucidate my soil microbial and plant

response to climate variability he is

141
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:52,180
more as more recent research efforts

Regional Sales Manager knee so we have a

150
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:19,718
very exciting panel I'm going to jump

151
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,750
right into the questions so in a

152
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:24,490
commercial growing operation

153
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,889
conservation of resources including time

154
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,918
and money is vital changing from

155
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,399
traditional cannabis growing techniques

156
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,838
consisting of bottle salt nutrients to

157
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,790
nutrients to instead using holistic

158
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:37,199
growing techniques

159
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,720
that brings soil alive can see

160
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,599
differently expends there at differently

161
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,140
expensive in time training and changes

162
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,180
to operating procedures management often

163
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,459
resists making a switch because they're

164
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,139
afraid of the risk involved in doing

165
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:54,209
something differently with so much is on

166
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,189
the line and focusing on building

167
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,529
thriving microbe communities and

168
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:01,079
commercial operations substrate be

169
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:08,159
financially beneficial in addition to

170
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:10,319
just being more natural all right I

171
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,500
guess I've been voted to go first so

172
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,899
when I'm working with my clients to to

173
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,490
get them into the transition a lot of

174
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,709
times you know you've got the farmers

175
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,400
who have got this interest you to move

176
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,779
towards living soils and microbes and

177
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,779
and then there's somebody else with the

178
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:30,719
purse strings whose job it is to to

179
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,610
judge and handle risk and so very often

180
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,070
what I'll see is that the growers want

181
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,229
to go very natural because they want to

182
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,750
be producing your top-shelf stuff with

183
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,729
really wide terpene profiles that look

184
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,500
good in the bag and then you've got

185
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,540
people who are holding the purse strings

186
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,539
that say we wanted to keep the risk as

187
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,769
low as possible and so we want you to do

188
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:52,019
it the way that it's always been done

189
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,509
well the problem is is that the way it's

190
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,850
always been done has generally been

191
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:59,189
indoor or in renegade outdoor sitting

192
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,440
down for situations and so a lot of the

193
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,330
techniques that we've done in the past

194
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,970
with the risk assessment has changed and

195
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,910
so what I tell them is that if you want

196
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,629
to if you want to move if you want to

197
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:11,629
make this transition

198
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:19,809
and end up with a product that works

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,180
really well that you not stay on the

200
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,009
Shelf very long will get you a nice

201
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,859
price point and will also create

202
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:33,059
customer loyalty the way to go about it

203
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:37,240
is to get your soil up and going first

204
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:39,609
because once the soil is alive and

205
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,100
active you can use it again and again

206
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,620
and so now you're starting to save money

207
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,769
and now you're putting less money into

208
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,629
mechanics and and that is how you move

209
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:51,579
towards your transition trying to say

210
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:53,769
that you're going to stop your

211
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,310
traditional bottle nutrients our hydro

212
00:09:53,769 --> 00:10:00,370
today and then tomorrow suddenly be a

213
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:02,859
probiotic micro appositive grow that's

214
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,509
unrealistic and and the people who are

215
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,990
saying that this is too risky they're

216
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:10,240
probably right and so what I always

217
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,370
recommend is that you start building

218
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,519
your soil and some extra piece of the

219
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,950
property that you may have and you know

220
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,169
get it going started inoculating there

221
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,870
with mycelium started inoculating with

222
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:24,789
microbe communities it was start a

223
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,860
separate pile for compost that you're

224
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:29,708
going to you're going to need in

225
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,000
overtime and so so if you're if you're a

226
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:33,219
farm that's already going to say that

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,159
you are already 215 and now you want to

228
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,700
kind of up your game for for an adult

229
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,850
rack market start small by getting your

230
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,920
soil going first and then that way when

231
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,800
you when you make your transition your

232
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,360
product you won't experience a dip

233
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,729
because a lot of folks when they when

234
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,950
they make a transition

235
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,389
from bottled nutrients and not all

236
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,430
bottle nutrients I'm talking about like

237
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:58,259
like salt nutrients because balance

238
00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:02,849
comes in a bottle too but it but it's a

239
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:04,889
line right so it's different so the

240
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,950
transition you won't get this dip as

241
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:10,199
your soil gets beefy and full of life

242
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,480
right what you've got is soil that's

243
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,250
already full of life and so when you go

244
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,230
to grow into it the product that you get

245
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,679
off of it hopefully on your first cycle

246
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:22,019
will be as good or better as as the

247
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,209
bottle stuff you're going at have done

248
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,000
in the past plus the added advantage of

249
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:30,090
all the marketing win because now you're

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,629
providing a living living product and

251
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,040
living soil which as we all know

252
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:37,159
connoisseurs are moving towards quickly

253
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,159
now

254
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:50,790
I can say as far as scaling a commercial

255
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:55,528
crow to a more regenerative practice

256
00:11:50,789 --> 00:12:01,309
from from you know a typical I guess

257
00:11:55,528 --> 00:12:01,309
smart pot and till a man type of

258
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:09,539
application would be to start building

259
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,379
the soil like Shengo says and one thing

260
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:16,620
that we have found on a smaller scale

261
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:21,120
was she coaching and building your soil

262
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:28,070
with compost from your garden with for

263
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:30,328
stuff with downed tree limbs or down

264
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,278
brush from around the property

265
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:34,319
bringing messed up in letting it

266
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:40,259
decompose and you're building your

267
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:46,620
microbes that way we also found that

268
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:51,088
scaling of Korea natural farming is is a

269
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:54,629
challenge as well and we have started to

270
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:58,470
go with the things that are easy to say

271
00:12:54,629 --> 00:13:00,958
and most I guess able to wrap your brain

272
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,509
around as far as when you're when you're

273
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,769
making

274
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:08,069
way through there and builds confidence

275
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:10,509
it makes you want to start taking on new

276
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:16,060
new challenges that's what as far as

277
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:18,759
your for me goes so on top of building

278
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:20,199
soil with with sheet mulching we also on

279
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,750
my farm that have been doing a lot of

280
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,390
Hugo culture which is an amazing way to

281
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,429
build your soil as again the downed

282
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:29,679
trees and rotten firewood and you're

283
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:34,839
bringing in mycelium from that you're

284
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:37,000
bringing in all kinds of stuff from from

285
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,870
the forest around you take it from

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,370
different areas you've got different

287
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:45,250
different biology all over the place so

288
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:53,350
that's that's the main thing I can say

289
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:56,019
is I want to add something to since I

290
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,300
just interviewed named for my youtube

291
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,189
channel I think that he also said that I

292
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,829
thought was really great for my clients

293
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,840
is that he went through his PNL and

294
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,340
looked at his most expensive inputs

295
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,170
right because when we're scaling for

296
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,850
commercial I mean it was one thing at

297
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,769
2:15 but now that you're trying to serve

298
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,690
as much in the country as you can those

299
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:15,939
those input prices are suddenly much

300
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,550
higher and he targeted those and he's

301
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,930
like ok how can I make this I using

302
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:21,939
Korean natural farming techniques

303
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:25,029
whatever I was trying to buy in the

304
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,740
bottle how can I do that with simple you

305
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,539
know wild crafted or you know you know

306
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,159
if you're a big operation you might not

307
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,750
have time to send team in to the florist

308
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,089
again stuff but you can order things

309
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,330
online that you can then make your own

310
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,800
at a fraction of the price using a

311
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,480
Korean natural farming fermenting

312
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,899
techniques that other people just by the

313
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,899
bottle

314
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:47,269
yeah

315
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,509
so I think the perspective that I bring

316
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,909
to this is thinking about from a

317
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:58,240
scientific perspective understanding

318
00:14:53,909 --> 00:15:02,399
knowing it's a fact that microbes and

319
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,860
biology and these natural inputs are

320
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,440
beneficial and probably needed for

321
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,629
agriculture the movement that we tried

322
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,880
to address as scientists at the

323
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:15,759
University was understanding after years

324
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,919
decades of studies showing how chemical

325
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,720
inputs are declining soil health

326
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,659
declining microbial diversity is so

327
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,970
declining soil ability to sustain plant

328
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:27,219
life and that was a huge problem so our

329
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,290
goal was to figure out how to scale

330
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,720
bridge that gap and bring nature and

331
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,189
natural processes back to agriculture we

332
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,100
think of cannabis farming as an

333
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:38,890
agriculture doing that requires a lot of

334
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,750
steps and it all comes down to scale the

335
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:42,069
thing on the size of a farm I think

336
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,799
that's one of the biggest challenges

337
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,860
farming cannabis farming in general has

338
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,659
these days I've been to some huge farms

339
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,209
just over the last couple of days and

340
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:54,100
all we talk about a scale yeah they're

341
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,569
using microbes there's no question and

342
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,000
even a couple years ago this might have

343
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,770
been different I worked with people all

344
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,259
over the world in the black market and

345
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:05,559
in this market and through the Americas

346
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:08,439
and Europe in Australia and it's less

347
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,179
known about the benefits of microbes in

348
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,680
some of the other countries it's new

349
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:13,539
it's really hydroponic and so I'm

350
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,389
writing articles and letting people

351
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:18,069
understand why you can how you can plug

352
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,990
microbes into these agricultural

353
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,040
management practices even if it is high

354
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,779
up life in that

355
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,389
so that so there's this huge education

356
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:28,179
gap don't you get beyond that it turns

357
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,610
into a scalability I think in a perfect

358
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:33,009
world we want to mimic nature there's no

359
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,710
plant in nature that can survive without

360
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:37,600
the microbes and these natural nutrient

361
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:41,470
cycling processes about about a full

362
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,779
slow up and living soil that is really

363
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,870
difficult for some facilities to do if

364
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,370
you have multiple acre size greenhouses

365
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:51,009
and you're pushing out hundreds of

366
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,830
thousands of plants and pots it's not

367
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:56,799
really the structure that nature and

368
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,840
living soil thrives in and so I think

369
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,000
it's about understanding your

370
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,180
limitations understanding what you are

371
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,359
capable of implementing and scaling that

372
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,060
in many cases it's a huge win for even

373
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,059
these larger or huge cannabis

374
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:14,289
cultivators to understand Wow microbes

375
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,029
were good and they're looking at the

376
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:18,220
products of the technology I plug in

377
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:20,649
with efficacy and effectiveness meaning

378
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,910
efficacy they work really really well in

379
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,350
the different soils in the different

380
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,360
environment they've created and

381
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:28,029
effectiveness they're actually showing

382
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,909
consistent results increase quality

383
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:33,039
increased yield that's what we want we

384
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,990
want to distinguish we want to maximize

385
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,079
our clients phenotypic potential we

386
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,480
cannot do that my opinion with just

387
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:43,179
chemical fertilizers we can take the

388
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,529
plants so much further if we introduce

389
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,460
some other additives

390
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:50,379
I heard interactions however it's not

391
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,990
only inputs I think that's really

392
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,210
important it's also about workflow it's

393
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,460
also about space and all these things

394
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,970
that have this larger scale cost a time

395
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:04,090
of capital to support and so I think

396
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,910
it's really is a process of where we are

397
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:09,699
now looking at all the different

398
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,130
verticals of benefits and understanding

399
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,970
over time how to plug them in that scale

400
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,470
where we can meet economic and in in a

401
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,600
lot of the big businesses I deal with

402
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,720
now canvas cultivation businesses

403
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:25,329
they're looking at the full spectrum all

404
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,700
the verticals of cost the labor cost the

405
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:30,669
intra cost the album costs and they're

406
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,620
measuring all those costs along with the

407
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,000
return how much yield am I getting how

408
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:36,639
much quality am I getting is that

409
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,660
quality and yield metric averaging out

410
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,660
for or worth all this other labor and

411
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,940
all these other instruments personally

412
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,009
I'd love to see the movement going this

413
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,900
way I do think that it's a balance and

414
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,759
that every decision we make there's

415
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,340
trade-offs that we make and so

416
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,190
incorporating what makes sense now and

417
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:59,379
having a vision of how we could make

418
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,820
that better is I think how agriculture

419
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,180
moves it's how this industry is moving

420
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:06,490
it's moving relatively fast I'll close

421
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,340
on this topic by saying you know the use

422
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,929
of microbials and microbial a stimulant

423
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:13,308
some more

424
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:16,139
the formal term is the quickest growing

425
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:19,048
agriculture input segment across every

426
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:21,990
crop globally it's because it's

427
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:23,548
necessary farmers across many many

428
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,730
different crops have understood that

429
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:28,200
they literally hit a wall in some way

430
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,899
some people tournament chemical

431
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,788
fertilizers of Aldus not saying that

432
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:34,109
chemical fertilizers don't work saying

433
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:35,908
that they've hit their limits and

434
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:37,949
they're looking for catalyst and

435
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:40,049
microbes and other natural solutions to

436
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,730
allow plants to continue to grow a

437
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:44,220
little to maximize the yield to maximize

438
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,899
nutrient use efficiency the nutrients we

439
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,179
put into the soil into the substrate

440
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:50,579
should be taken up by the plant in in

441
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:54,570
many cases some nutrients to have about

442
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:56,128
30% efficiency meaning we have a lot of

443
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:58,439
unused fertilizer that builds up from

444
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:01,618
here up here in the soil and that's why

445
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,399
we think biology as a solution help

446
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,398
balance that out

447
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:13,350
all right thank you so much of the

448
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,600
market for flour is based on bag appeal

449
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:19,240
and many consider frosty flowers and

450
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,549
intense coloration to be the best result

451
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,279
or to be the result of intense synthetic

452
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:27,399
nutrients so what can commercial scale

453
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:29,649
growers do to create frosty flowers with

454
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,480
great bang appeal while also respecting

455
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,080
the health of substrate microbe

456
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,079
communities

457
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:43,500
yeah so something for her back appeal

458
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:48,350
that we do on our farm is we have

459
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,349
microbes in we do compost tea we do

460
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,480
another microbe inoculation is called OG

461
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:58,980
bile or it's filled with all kinds of

462
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,339
good stuff and we also employ water

463
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:07,190
saving techniques we feel that making

464
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:10,740
the plant a little water deprived

465
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:15,028
actually makes it produce more terpenes

466
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,759
and more cannabinoids so we have gone to

467
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:22,589
a irrigation system that essentially

468
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:26,610
gives the plant just as much water as it

469
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:28,619
desires no more and no less and we're

470
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:31,528
finding that the the product that's

471
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,508
coming out of it looks amazing and some

472
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:36,269
of the stuff that we're getting ready to

473
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:39,659
take down after after this this light

474
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:41,970
death this looks better than the stuff

475
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,309
that we've ever ground not necessarily

476
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,379
the biggest flowers but definitely the

477
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:49,950
sexiest and hopefully the best-tasting

478
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:52,668
so those are some of the things I could

479
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,669
point to

480
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,900
so since I know that polish my going to

481
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:00,490
talk about inputs to I'm actually going

482
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,710
to go a different route about this and

483
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,599
say something that is generally

484
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,259
unpopular with my clients when I tell

485
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:09,639
them it and it's two things number one

486
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:12,250
you know especially when you're talking

487
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,460
to fanboys people talk about the frosty

488
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:17,170
nuts right and super frosty flowers are

489
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,269
the sexiest things and and if they're

490
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,130
all white they're perfect and this is

491
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:23,319
like being addicted to steroids where

492
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:27,010
the muscles there the muscles are better

493
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:28,720
and that's just untrue I think that the

494
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:30,970
market is going to eventually become

495
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,279
more educated over the next decade and

496
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,039
realize that just because of flowers

497
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,769
frosty does not make it ultra premium

498
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,230
and what you want I will absolutely take

499
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:45,339
something that is less frosty that has

500
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:48,490
less trichomes but has the the powerful

501
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:51,789
terpenes that come from full spectrum

502
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:55,779
sunshine and has been fed with an array

503
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:59,049
of compost teas and microbes and other

504
00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:01,119
living environments you know soils and

505
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:05,559
other substrates that worms can actually

506
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:08,049
live in and that the challenge with this

507
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,990
of course is that it takes more labour I

508
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:13,750
was talking with the guy a couple weeks

509
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,759
ago and you know Expo nearby here in San

510
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,329
Francisco and he was talking to me he's

511
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:21,940
asking me for hints for his forty acre

512
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:24,250
hydro greenhouse in Sacramento Valley

513
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,160
and I'm all and think of my first self

514
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,509
like I'm

515
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,100
the guy you want to be talking to you

516
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:29,809
because all I'm gonna be telling you is

517
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:31,219
tears right you know I'm not the guy

518
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:35,000
who's me saying the things that you want

519
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:38,299
to hear but what I'm generally telling

520
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,569
people other than 40 acres you know

521
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:45,519
bring back the one acre cap other than

522
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:48,859
that what I continue to tell people is

523
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:52,309
spend less money on your mechanical

524
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:54,919
overhead and spend more money on actual

525
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:57,349
human staff who know how to grow and

526
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,289
have them be near the plants there's

527
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:02,929
nothing that is going to impact the

528
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:06,589
plants afterward you give it good inputs

529
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,029
then the hand of the grower and being

530
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:10,069
attentive to it all the time

531
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,450
and even though you know a lot of the

532
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:12,769
people they're looking at they're PL

533
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,450
they're all like you need to put in

534
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:17,660
watering systems there's still nothing

535
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,220
like and watering not only for the plant

536
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,710
to get the right amount of water but

537
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:25,370
more importantly to put the grower in

538
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:27,200
the proximity of the plant more often to

539
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:28,909
take care of it regularly there's a

540
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,039
ancient Chinese proverb that I'm gonna

541
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,560
probably in a poorly paraphrase that is

542
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,599
the best fertilizer for a plant is the

543
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,700
growers shadow right or the growers

544
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,309
footsteps so you get the idea and yet

545
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,500
and that is one thing about scaling and

546
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:46,579
you know this convention is clearly all

547
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:50,539
about scaling that I often recommend to

548
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:53,629
scale less spend more money on your

549
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:56,359
natural and human inputs like how humans

550
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,010
as an input and that is how you can

551
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:00,859
start to make this transition to a

552
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:03,230
higher quality product that will fly off

553
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:05,809
the shelves because it's so great and

554
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,579
bring people back for more because the

555
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:09,950
question is done would you buy this

556
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:12,139
product once the question is would you

557
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,100
buy it again and there's not a lot of

558
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,929
stuff that I would

559
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:18,949
a second time that's not growing

560
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:23,679
properly under the Sun in living soil in

561
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,679
in smaller matches with dedicated humans

562
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,919
[Applause]

563
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:33,140
I think you know I can't really relate

564
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,240
to the frosty buzz comment as much as

565
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,770
the quality I travel all over the world

566
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,919
I work with people all over the world

567
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:43,369
are cultivating and in the u.s. there is

568
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,770
that try and call me frosty but faint

569
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:48,678
but everywhere else in the world

570
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:50,750
people are asking me about the turkeys

571
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,519
and smell and I was talking to another

572
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,380
grower just yesterday we had a great

573
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:56,150
conversation he's a little partner a

574
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,679
little south of here and we talked about

575
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,230
this overall experience he can almost

576
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,538
relate it to maybe someone outside of

577
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,700
this industry to a meal you know you

578
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:06,288
have this experience that sits with you

579
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,569
and if you have a wonderful meal at a

580
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:10,640
restaurant this is a sign example you're

581
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:12,798
coming back because it really did it for

582
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,570
you and you get there you see this plate

583
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,400
of food that you wanted and it looks

584
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:17,839
great and it smells great and also it

585
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,030
tastes great and you have this effect

586
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,369
it's all these senses that you're

587
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:24,619
getting invoked by that experience it's

588
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:26,000
the same thing this guy was relating and

589
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:27,288
he's been around for a long time he was

590
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,970
talking about back in the 80s and 90s

591
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:31,308
it's like you know I would try and check

592
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,140
all those boxes with my customers they

593
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:35,509
would get a bag for me they look and I'd

594
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,430
see their eyes brighten up and look

595
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:39,049
isn't flour and kind of expected then

596
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,180
they would smell it then they would

597
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:43,369
actually taste it and get that nice

598
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,519
experience and then they experience the

599
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:48,589
results from it consuming and he said I

600
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:51,259
can tick all the boxes with that

601
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:53,299
customer I had it for life that can

602
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:56,390
really relate to that it has very little

603
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:59,029
to do honestly even with THC there's so

604
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,850
much THC that you could almost get now

605
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:03,829
it's about this full flavor this full

606
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:05,779
experience and I'll say these verticals

607
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:07,759
are not any one thing there's a whole

608
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:08,990
management that you can maximize what I

609
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,240
like to call the plants phenotypic

610
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,650
potential when I go into a dispensary to

611
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,779
talk to my friends I don't look for the

612
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,269
strongest flower I look for the flower

613
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:18,769
that's nice and smooth and it tastes

614
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:20,299
like it smells and I can have a nice

615
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,549
experience so I know what I'm looking

616
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:24,589
for it's really that quality you know

617
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,909
the th C's that are relevant to me I

618
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:27,199
think there's so many different levels

619
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,210
is just what it is

620
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,090
and what does that mean what are those

621
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,069
verticals you know plants determined by

622
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:36,559
genetics let's Eclipse base that there's

623
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:39,200
a genetics vertical that's critical to

624
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,089
get that plant a genotype and phenotype

625
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,559
for what you want and different

626
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:43,939
phenotypes have different

627
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,369
characteristics and that's why we

628
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,630
breathe phenotypes because we want

629
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:49,669
different characteristics in those

630
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,950
plants so we breed that there's this

631
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,450
whole climate variability where we have

632
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,680
to control their climate in the corona

633
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,080
environment because that strongly

634
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,299
dictates the health and the outcome of

635
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:00,919
that plan there's inputs which I have an

636
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,119
input tag more than anything else that's

637
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,730
what I understand that includes

638
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,129
nutrients in microbes and nourishing the

639
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,870
claim to the best of its ability if the

640
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,790
plane can take up all the nutrients it

641
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:13,159
needs naturally and that's the third

642
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,690
facilitation with biology and the

643
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,620
availability of nutrients are living

644
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:19,860
soil is going to be able to

645
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:21,839
sighs its health development quality and

646
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,269
yield it can do these things and then

647
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,949
there's this last vertical bit very few

648
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:29,099
people talk about now it's fascinating I

649
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:31,019
went to a facility yesterday morning and

650
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:34,379
this is a big-time deal they've build a

651
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:36,269
million-dollar curing room felt like

652
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,880
that's where half of the quality is

653
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:39,509
getting lost a lot by back in after the

654
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,190
harvest

655
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,450
okay you're probably right let me ask

656
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,340
the other people that has put things in

657
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,259
bags and you know I see a degree to

658
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:48,149
almost immediately I see a degree that's

659
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:50,190
not almost immediate but that's the

660
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,890
example it's just really an important

661
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,519
part of quality and it maintains not

662
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:58,259
only the THC and the CBD profiles but

663
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,240
the flavor and those terpene profiles

664
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:01,799
I'll tell you what I can't say enough

665
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,130
about these therapies I'm just obsessed

666
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:07,049
with it and everything that we test with

667
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,740
our product and the P is a microbial

668
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:12,299
product we're focused on quality we know

669
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,220
we can increase you know a lot of great

670
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:16,950
products do that but if we can't bring

671
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,259
quality with it or exceed quality you

672
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,090
know I think we're really missing the

673
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,490
main point and that's what we really

674
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:26,220
focus on so maximizing the plants

675
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:29,039
phenotypic potential for that flavor and

676
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,440
that full experience from the moment you

677
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,079
see it to experiencing it through smell

678
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,240
taste and the ultimate feeling so that's

679
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,490
a that's a big

680
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,920
picture of how I think about the clan

681
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:44,000
and how we can kind of tweak those

682
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,890
different verticals to maximize that the

683
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,099
genetics really I like that

684
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:54,980
maximizing genetic potential okay great

685
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:56,449
so I do see some questions rolling in

686
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,279
we're not quite there yet but I just

687
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,429
wanted to remind people in case they

688
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:03,980
came in a little bit later that the

689
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:06,470
cannabis Business Summit has an app you

690
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,210
just download it from the App Store and

691
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,400
then once it's downloaded each have

692
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,950
schedule from the menu and to find this

693
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,259
session type in my growth it will come

694
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,660
up right away for you and then just

695
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:19,429
scroll down and tap on the session Q&amp;A

696
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,240
and then you're able to submit your

697
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:22,040
questions right there

698
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,019
and then I get them on my phone right

699
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,420
here so we'll be absolutely as many of

700
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:32,750
those as we can any moment here when we

701
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:34,759
get to that section all right so yeah I

702
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,589
actually I totally agree that you know

703
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,150
in 10 years from now blinking flowers

704
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:40,428
people only talking about that at all

705
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,380
it's not even gonna be it's not even

706
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:44,660
gonna be a thing

707
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,370
so outdoor growing in native soils has

708
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:50,480
become increasingly popular due to

709
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:52,969
cannabis normalization what is a

710
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,460
regenerative practice or try tired

711
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:58,610
native soils that notes or cannabis

712
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:01,400
growers can use to reject rejuvenate

713
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:04,909
local soils instead of merely growing

714
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,800
indoors in bags or outdoors in bags of

715
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,850
shipped in soil I think this is really

716
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,849
really important

717
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:19,190
so I guess I'm just gonna throw my

718
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,379
science card out here and talk about

719
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,180
healthy soil and what that means to me

720
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,120
is the scientists and I might have to

721
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,160
talk about card you know in carbon but

722
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,839
frankly is the currency of life here on

723
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,340
earth all carbon-based

724
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,129
everything revolves around carbon

725
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:36,289
instead of soil health and if you look

726
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,700
at healthy Silver's is not healthy so on

727
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:39,889
you can talk about it fertility

728
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,140
perspective or about a diversity

729
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,820
perspective you can see a very strong

730
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,950
correlation based on the amount of

731
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,809
carbon that's in s so it's a cation

732
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,480
exchange capacity its ability to hold

733
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:53,599
soil and hold nutrients and it's all too

734
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,759
new harder and so if you look at that as

735
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:59,859
a metric for success or soil health you

736
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:03,920
can really dial in with a large degree

737
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:06,559
of success how successful you're going

738
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,200
to be in using soils to grow here

739
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,839
planting the why I'm bringing carbon up

740
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,860
is you can add carbon simply it's really

741
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:18,740
hard to manage and turn the natural soil

742
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:21,279
at the greatest loss of natural soil you

743
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,859
know and a growing season or any year

744
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,099
already been in a decade soils of all

745
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:31,139
over decades

746
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:33,480
just natural if you take pretty

747
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,370
extensive steps to build up the soil you

748
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,110
can get there a lot quicker and these

749
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:40,439
guys at the panel of experts effect and

750
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:42,479
I like to do that in at my home and

751
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,820
building so a lot of pretty fascinated

752
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,919
by that but if you're really trying to

753
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:49,019
take steps where you could manage and

754
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,210
work with the soil and take the right

755
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,710
steps to build that make it healthier

756
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:56,548
you know there are simple things like

757
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:59,220
even I call it carbon black but it's

758
00:32:56,548 --> 00:33:00,808
just a burnt carbon and everyone's using

759
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,659
right now just to create cation exchange

760
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:06,210
capacity you can add microbes you can

761
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:08,970
add all sorts of carbon to mix in to

762
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:11,690
help sustain soil health and start

763
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,690
building that up

764
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:26,750
so to the carbon thing we have with the

765
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,298
Hyuga culture mounds we have tried to

766
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,659
sequester as much of the carbon on our

767
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:37,490
property that is just laying around as

768
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:39,230
possible and to the birch or the biochar

769
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:49,730
is what we're also using as well to

770
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:51,860
increase our CC and we feel that while

771
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,470
this year is very challenging and we

772
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:58,369
have a lot of wood underneath our Hubel

773
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:01,100
mounds that next year as the rains hit

774
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,959
in the fall and and moving forward that

775
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:06,980
wood is gonna break down and it's gonna

776
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:11,809
break down into beautiful rich black

777
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:21,619
soil and we're really excited about our

778
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:24,230
that goes we also are creating our own

779
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:26,780
biochar we're burning some wood and

780
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,250
putting it out and doing the hardwoods

781
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:32,839
and then adding it into our soil as well

782
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:35,989
so as far as those two things go I can

783
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:38,029
definitely attest to

784
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,638
amazing as far as doing her you're

785
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,859
living so illios and then the compost

786
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,369
tea just to get it to get it working and

787
00:34:42,858 --> 00:34:45,369
moving

788
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:53,219
all right so so I'm gonna take one

789
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:57,239
position and I'm going to tell you why

790
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:58,679
it's wrong so the position that I picked

791
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,309
up for the first time I answered was

792
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:05,429
that I'm a probiotic person who believes

793
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:08,729
in living soil and so if you want to

794
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:11,429
regenerate your property you are going

795
00:35:08,728 --> 00:35:15,328
to want to cover that sweetheart with

796
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:18,088
compost cheese grab yourself some some

797
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:20,460
cheap M seeds for fiber hem and plant

798
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:24,028
them and everywhere plant some other

799
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,880
companion plants and not so much for for

800
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:28,889
pests necessarily but other plants that

801
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,200
are targeted for the kind of soil that

802
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:33,748
you have so they can start building up

803
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:38,098
life and carbon and nitrogen in the soil

804
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:42,389
and and and and take you the take this

805
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:47,969
neglected ground make it alive again and

806
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:52,018
then plant it your next season with your

807
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:54,420
your commercial crop the problem is is

808
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:57,419
that you know I'm a probiotic guy but I

809
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,818
also study business plans and I also

810
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,130
give business advice and we're in

811
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:04,440
California and none of you have time to

812
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,170
leave your property fallow for a year

813
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,630
and let this happen right so my first

814
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,778
suggestion to clients is don't buy

815
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:16,229
crappy property you should be in there

816
00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:19,289
ahead of time get soil tests find out

817
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:21,509
where the floodplain is talk to local

818
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:23,670
farming neighbors find out why the

819
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:26,699
people before you dump to the property

820
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:29,400
don't get stuck with a bad piece of dirt

821
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,328
that you can't work do your work on in

822
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,829
the first place

823
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:35,589
now with

824
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:37,539
said you know their margins are so tight

825
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:40,900
and everything is so hyper competitive

826
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:43,749
in California while while using these

827
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:46,269
solutions totally work and that's where

828
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:49,298
my heart is right I love a permaculture

829
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:50,848
guy at heart but I also don't want my

830
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:54,068
clients to go out of business because

831
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:57,519
they have you know birds an important

832
00:36:54,068 --> 00:37:00,818
season going through their their capital

833
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:01,899
trying to regenerate the soil so so I

834
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:06,308
know it's kind of a different approach

835
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:10,358
to the question but but my goal would be

836
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:13,180
don't buy bad property to begin with and

837
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:15,159
do your homework upfront and choose

838
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:19,268
property that you can do your magic on

839
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:22,149
to begin with I think there's a balance

840
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:24,159
we can have goals and I think it's

841
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:26,108
absolutely right it's really hard to sit

842
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,699
on a property for a year or ten years

843
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:30,278
and say hey in ten years this is going

844
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:31,929
to be great and until then soon enough

845
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:34,389
money in the building of us will I have

846
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:37,268
no return that's not practical and it's

847
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:39,489
not realistic but if you have a goal

848
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:42,518
this is what this needs to look like you

849
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:46,389
can incorporate and scale reasonable

850
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:48,368
inputs to get your soil built a better

851
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,739
year after a year and you know there's a

852
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:52,829
lot of great examples where you can get

853
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:55,298
additive improvements through management

854
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:56,829
they're extra plants through cover

855
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:58,268
cropping through you know getting

856
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:59,410
leggings and they ground our clothes in

857
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:01,929
the ground we're actually fixing

858
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:04,239
nitrogen delivering nitrogen through

859
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:06,129
different plants right into soil to

860
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:10,199
enhance more loud diversity more carbon

861
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,199
microbes are carbon just like you know

862
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:16,420
there's a lot of different solutions

863
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,829
that are out there and it's about

864
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,769
figuring out what's practical with

865
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:23,920
scaleable and what's the now solution so

866
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:27,578
you can keep doing your business keep

867
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:33,548
growing and regenerate the way you want

868
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:35,528
to let's continue to build towards that

869
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:39,068
I think those are realistic ways to

870
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:41,818
accomplish you know everything we need

871
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:44,768
to maintain soil health and maintaining

872
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:46,268
I got another tweener idea actually

873
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:48,548
which is a good idea to sometime take a

874
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:50,198
look at things in to black and white but

875
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:53,048
the other thing you can do is you can do

876
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:54,009
your first season or two in bags or pots

877
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:57,579
of some sort

878
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:59,318
and be working on the soil while you're

879
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:01,539
doing that you know you can even have

880
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:04,719
your rows of pots and you can be hitting

881
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:08,650
the ground with companion plants and

882
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:12,068
with compost teas and different types of

883
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:14,229
can affirmance around the bags and so

884
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:16,630
maybe in two or three years when you're

885
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:17,149
feeling that now now the soil around the

886
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,579
bags

887
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,318
right now you can now you can give up

888
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:23,599
the bags and go right into the soil and

889
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:26,440
kind of like grow into where you want to

890
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,490
be so so that would be realistic as well

891
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,700
all right great

892
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:34,219
so what challenges can a farmer trying

893
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:36,519
to employ regenerative practices expect

894
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:36,519
to encounter

895
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:50,859
so the biggest thing that we found is

896
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:55,840
trying to try to scale our labor away

897
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:59,950
from the traditional I guess farming and

898
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,559
going into the more natural bringing in

899
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:06,219
your own inputs type thing and it's been

900
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:12,340
it's been tough we we scaling up to

901
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:15,579
Arcana we decided that we need about one

902
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:19,329
gallon of each input that we're using

903
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:23,259
currently a week and so we have scaled

904
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:25,569
up to our pickling crocks rather than

905
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,900
our little pint jars to make our

906
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:33,130
ferments with local plants fruits we're

907
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:35,740
doing lactic acid bacteria from a goat

908
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:40,200
farmer that's that's local to us we

909
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:44,619
could really Chico them from her and

910
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:46,899
getting these things to be ready when

911
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:48,339
we're ready for them as has been a

912
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,860
little bit difficult but so what we're

913
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:56,980
doing is each week we're trying to make

914
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:58,720
a new input and sourcing the the plants

915
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,559
has been really easy the thing that we

916
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,289
found challenging on our property was

917
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:09,869
sourcing fruits for the Fuhrman

918
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:11,250
fermented fruit juice so we got berries

919
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:15,359
and stuff around the property is really

920
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:17,760
good but we also had to go to just other

921
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,059
parts of the flowering plant and

922
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:27,780
actually just take in the flowering

923
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:30,059
we've also started fermenting horse teas

924
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,560
a really good one for for silica and for

925
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:35,869
your powdery mildews and your diseases

926
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:39,360
but we also started doing thistles

927
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:42,569
because it's a very very hearty plant

928
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,880
shows very little resistance or I'm

929
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:46,670
sorry a very high resistance to s

930
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,050
pathogens any of that stuff so

931
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,360
fermenting that we're trying to pass

932
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,710
that into our plants and we found really

933
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,920
really good results with it and it's

934
00:41:52,710 --> 00:42:00,480
it's making our plants tick off as far

935
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:05,550
as the Hyuga culture and and sheep mulch

936
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:08,280
egos we have plenty of biomass around

937
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,950
our property the biggest problem is

938
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,080
getting it to where we needed we would

939
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:14,519
want to we live on a really steep

940
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,199
incline and

941
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:20,820
from one place to the other has been

942
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:26,730
challenging so those are a couple of the

943
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:28,740
things I can think of also we I think

944
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:32,369
Shenko mentioned earlier check out the

945
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:34,019
piano we had noticed that our piano one

946
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:37,860
of the biggest things that we had going

947
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:39,509
was earthworm castings we were spending

948
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,970
a ton of money every year on earth on

949
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:45,270
casting so we decided to scale up our

950
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:48,779
earthworms and we're trying to produce

951
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:51,840
as much earthworm castings as we use on

952
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,960
a yearly basis which is about six or

953
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,180
seven yards so scaling up to that has

954
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,389
been challenging trying to find enough

955
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:03,799
of the right material for the worms to

956
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:05,819
to eat and create a really nice rich

957
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,380
earthworm casting that's been a

958
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:13,380
challenge for us the list goes on and on

959
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,400
to be completely honest but those are a

960
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,400
couple of the big ones

961
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:21,188
so I'd only getting it on one because

962
00:43:18,938 --> 00:43:24,879
Nate's right maybe the list of things

963
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:27,368
that can go wrong with probiotics is

964
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,900
long but you know they're the list of

965
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,269
things that can go wrong with hydro as

966
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,269
long as well what we are talking about

967
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:36,218
as a craft here right and so if you are

968
00:43:34,268 --> 00:43:37,568
better at one side of the craft than the

969
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:39,818
other you know if you're if you're a

970
00:43:37,568 --> 00:43:41,650
hydro guide and those are the things you

971
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:43,088
know you know doing the transition going

972
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,349
that way it's going to be harder if you

973
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:46,119
took me and put me in a hydro

974
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:47,919
environment I would probably have a

975
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,949
learning curve as well and that's why I

976
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:53,348
would say the primary challenge is

977
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:54,759
education and experience because all

978
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:58,559
three of us are here to tell you that

979
00:43:54,759 --> 00:44:01,269
that these natural inputs will replace

980
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,769
thin lines on your piano that are

981
00:44:01,268 --> 00:44:04,778
costing you a lot of money that you can

982
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:07,318
replace with just a little bit of effort

983
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:11,798
and a little bit of wild crafted or

984
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:14,288
purchased nutrients but you need to have

985
00:44:11,798 --> 00:44:15,909
the education to know what they are and

986
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:18,039
what the processes are and they're not

987
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:19,568
hard right but something something that

988
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:21,249
might just have a six step process you

989
00:44:19,568 --> 00:44:24,909
need to know what those six steps are

990
00:44:21,248 --> 00:44:26,708
and when when you're your upper

991
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:28,929
management and your investors are going

992
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:31,239
like hop to it we don't see anything

993
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:32,588
going on yet and you're like we go I'm

994
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:35,409
getting educated so there are things

995
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:37,509
metals yeah you know they're pushing you

996
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:39,159
to get it done now and you're like well

997
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:40,389
listen if we want to do this right we

998
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:43,358
need to make sure that we have the

999
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:44,469
education because you know you just like

1000
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:46,598
needs talking about with the crocks

1001
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:47,889
right you can have a ferment going and

1002
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,048
there are a lot of things that can go

1003
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:51,788
wrong with a Furman you know the first

1004
00:44:50,048 --> 00:44:54,159
time I made some of these things it took

1005
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:56,829
me two tries and because they take a

1006
00:44:54,159 --> 00:45:00,099
while to ferment you can make a mistake

1007
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:02,919
that that only costs you like six bucks

1008
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:06,269
and inputs but it cost you two months

1009
00:45:02,918 --> 00:45:08,000
and time right and so the primary

1010
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:10,250
mistake or the

1011
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,769
Challenge I think is the question it

1012
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,389
would be education and experience and I

1013
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:17,719
see that there's only really two ways

1014
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:21,529
that you can get that number one hire

1015
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:26,359
really well hire somebody who already

1016
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:28,490
has probiotics can have living soils mic

1017
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,710
building micro communities find somebody

1018
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:32,509
who already has that under their belt so

1019
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:33,740
they can hit the ground running and I

1020
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,150
gotta tell you there's not a lot of

1021
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:37,549
those people at the professional level

1022
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:39,740
who can also scale out you know five

1023
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:41,810
thousand plants or whatever your number

1024
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:44,449
is right there's a lot of those folks

1025
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:47,960
that are doing 50 plants or their

1026
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:49,489
basement right there you know these

1027
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,309
these these folks are all over the

1028
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:54,589
internet however finding those same

1029
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:56,179
people that can scale up to the

1030
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,340
commercial size that you're needing to

1031
00:45:56,179 --> 00:46:00,829
be able to make margins in California

1032
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,690
those people are very rare so be

1033
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:06,559
prepared to pay them what they're worth

1034
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:09,170
because when the cat gets out of the bag

1035
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,119
on board this is somebody else is going

1036
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:14,360
to want to steal them away from you or

1037
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:18,710
the second solution is build that

1038
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:21,140
education into it you know give your

1039
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:24,110
give your master growers some extra time

1040
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:26,179
to do continuing education just like any

1041
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:28,309
professional train you don't expect

1042
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:29,509
every professional to know everything

1043
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:31,400
every year that's why we've got

1044
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,290
continuing education for mental

1045
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,690
healthcare professionals and for lawyers

1046
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:38,809
and like you know so so build in

1047
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:40,880
education time for the grower and make

1048
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:43,130
them do it right because they're gonna

1049
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,530
want to please you and they may choose

1050
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,910
to like skip their education because

1051
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,180
they're feeling under a lot of pressure

1052
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:50,429
make them do

1053
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:51,690
continuing education and let them make

1054
00:46:50,429 --> 00:46:55,980
some of this mistakes with their

1055
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:58,710
ferments and build in that into it and

1056
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:02,400
let them take time to to take their

1057
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:04,380
staff and train them so that if staff

1058
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,510
people see something going wrong with a

1059
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,670
ferment or a plant or whatever is going

1060
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:10,980
on you know they couldn't see something

1061
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:13,858
say something right and they but but

1062
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,809
that only works if you're if you're you

1063
00:47:13,858 --> 00:47:18,719
know you're your lowest person on the

1064
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:21,500
chain knows what's going on has been

1065
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,909
taught by the top person in the chain so

1066
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,409
education and experience is clearly the

1067
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:28,289
biggest challenge that I see because a

1068
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:30,838
lot of this stuff is old ancient tech

1069
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:32,099
that's being brought back and it doesn't

1070
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:33,269
mean that anybody knows that we've all

1071
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,710
been in doors we're going under

1072
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:36,690
artificial lights of artificial

1073
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:39,358
nutrients for all these years and we're

1074
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:41,068
swinging back so don't just assume that

1075
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,558
it's going to be done without challenge

1076
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:47,460
yeah and I agree with all that I think

1077
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,769
that's just continue to comment on it's

1078
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,720
a process

1079
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:53,190
since scale is key I mean an example I

1080
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:54,929
was singing that one classes those guys

1081
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:57,210
taught us now is you know we have a girl

1082
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:58,949
you know we have a 62 acre farm we have

1083
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,809
several 5,000 square-foot greenhouses a

1084
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:02,250
10,000 square foot greenhouse mostly for

1085
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:04,140
high CBD half but we do mostly

1086
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:06,000
agronomics agriculture because we want

1087
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:10,369
to understand plants and Kapinos and

1088
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,590
genotypes and exactly what there

1089
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:14,599
we're trying to develop and we have some

1090
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,980
high THC farms also for research

1091
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:17,989
purposes and it's the same thing it's

1092
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,789
all agriculture research as a as a

1093
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:21,079
research scientist I work with a lot of

1094
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:22,579
different plants it's really hard

1095
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,440
understand plant microbe interactions if

1096
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:25,610
you don't apply to work with that's been

1097
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,409
a challenge that's why we've got these

1098
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,240
licenses entry' invested in one of my

1099
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:30,859
growers head girl reason he's awesome he

1100
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,289
has amassed his green hydroponics and

1101
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:37,579
he's really smart they need a lot of

1102
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:39,889
hydroponics and I love using microbes in

1103
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:41,509
soil and living soil and that's enough

1104
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:43,940
and you know he's our teammate he's on

1105
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:45,110
the team is in the company and he'll

1106
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,090
tell me straight up and then we're gonna

1107
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:48,860
do that through Colin I'm not your guy

1108
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,840
for that I don't understand it I'm like

1109
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:53,000
I understand the scale and the truth is

1110
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,920
there's this time life period where you

1111
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,099
know the way he's doing things is really

1112
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:02,030
efficient and he can bust out a lot of

1113
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:04,759
productivity the way he's doing but

1114
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:06,230
that's not the living soil away it's not

1115
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,780
even a soil way there's so many

1116
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:10,820
challenges and it's such a learning

1117
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,460
curve there's not enough people that

1118
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,260
know how it works and understand the

1119
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,420
biology and all the interesting things

1120
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,280
like even hydrology you think there's a

1121
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:22,130
difference in hydrology between cocoa

1122
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,410
and living soil yeah it's the level

1123
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:26,269
watering regime is 100% different here

1124
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:28,089
have to experiment with that along with

1125
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:31,219
everything else this is all everything

1126
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:33,650
changes and it takes time it's really

1127
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:36,469
hard to run a business and want to

1128
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:38,240
continue to produce on a cycle cycle

1129
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:40,699
cycle and introduce something that

1130
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,589
drastic and so it definitely takes the

1131
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:44,299
right person it takes flying across the

1132
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:46,220
board and takes that commitment probably

1133
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,260
from will talk from the money guys down

1134
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:50,089
to say hey this is who we are this is

1135
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,220
what we're going to do and we might not

1136
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:53,450
do this vertically across the world but

1137
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:55,669
we're going to have a component we're

1138
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,929
going that direction in invest money cuz

1139
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:00,619
it takes time it takes money it takes

1140
00:49:56,929 --> 00:50:04,969
the right people and those are all big

1141
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:07,400
topics to buy into so you know again

1142
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:10,489
it's a process and you think about this

1143
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,650
last point influence you know it's

1144
00:50:10,489 --> 00:50:15,169
pretty easy to source inputs for a

1145
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:17,420
hundred points easiest source if it's

1146
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,740
for a thousand planes well if you're

1147
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:20,619
trying to knock out a hundred thousand

1148
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:23,019
place

1149
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:24,880
that's a whole different game until you

1150
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:26,800
have those channels and you can bring

1151
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:31,090
those things in ultimately that scale is

1152
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:33,039
where you want to be but all the growing

1153
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:35,320
pains and the scaling between then is

1154
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,110
painful and super expensive and that's

1155
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:41,530
where you're going to lose a lot of the

1156
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:43,510
momentum from let's just called the

1157
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:45,130
business guys they're kind of lonely see

1158
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,330
that going they want to see profit you

1159
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,890
know let's see all that cost if you

1160
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:49,960
still agony of the things which you're

1161
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:52,000
going to see you have to educate not

1162
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,099
only internally and the practice and the

1163
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,329
biology you have to educate everyone in

1164
00:50:54,099 --> 00:50:56,860
your company saying this is what this

1165
00:50:55,329 --> 00:50:59,409
looks like these are the expectations

1166
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,210
and productivity expectations if we're

1167
00:50:59,409 --> 00:51:03,339
transitioning this way so by an

1168
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:05,530
across-the-board is critical it's easier

1169
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:08,079
at the home of our family farm it's hard

1170
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:09,610
if you have a corporation you have a

1171
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,869
whole bunch of people that are building

1172
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:16,420
out a large large commercial cultivation

1173
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:18,449
facility we need visionary leaders at

1174
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,450
that

1175
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:33,309
all right thank you so much so I'm gonna

1176
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:35,829
try to there's some that are kind of

1177
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:39,429
similar so I'm going to try to I'm gonna

1178
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:41,348
have to select them so what do you look

1179
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,419
for when comparing between products with

1180
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:46,150
microbes what is your opinion on

1181
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:53,889
products with many microbes in them do

1182
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:55,740
they compete with each other you know my

1183
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:58,299
perspective do you think about nature

1184
00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:00,069
tens of thousands of microbes interact

1185
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,720
together with fungi and bacteria and

1186
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:03,550
they do this in a very beneficial way

1187
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:05,858
and that's just the natural way so

1188
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,450
that's not necessarily a challenge I

1189
00:52:05,858 --> 00:52:08,858
would think what I what I think the

1190
00:52:07,449 --> 00:52:10,779
bigger challenge of using microbes is

1191
00:52:08,858 --> 00:52:12,429
understanding what they do you know I

1192
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,900
think a lot of people think of microbes

1193
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:16,210
and beneficial use those terms

1194
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,710
beneficials but do you know what

1195
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,970
microbes do do you understand the

1196
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,929
functional groups do we actually

1197
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,669
understand how many people really

1198
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:23,489
understand what mycorrhizal our best of

1199
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:25,809
the right mike rosa lungile

1200
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:28,088
how do they work yeah so this is a great

1201
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,619
audience for that so if you know what

1202
00:52:28,088 --> 00:52:31,869
they are you know the functional group

1203
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:35,050
then you know how to apply them in

1204
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:37,420
practice and you can use them correctly

1205
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:39,220
if you don't understand how they're

1206
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,619
functioning you don't understand their

1207
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:43,118
limitations it's very hard to use them

1208
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:45,220
and so I think that's the biggest

1209
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,838
disconnect over all communities of

1210
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:50,079
microbes live together again tens of

1211
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:51,849
thousands of microbes in much more so

1212
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,039
that's not the issue you all obviously

1213
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:56,620
have to have that experience

1214
00:52:54,039 --> 00:53:00,849
there's no antagonistic group so it just

1215
00:52:56,619 --> 00:53:03,429
in like in my in my experience more rare

1216
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:06,309
than not there's way more beneficial

1217
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:08,289
microbes that wasn't the one beneficial

1218
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:10,059
microbes in nature then there are any

1219
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:12,159
pathogens or anything so microbes like

1220
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:14,199
to work there's just part of nature you

1221
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,460
know what are you from back yogurts do

1222
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:17,669
what are differents a prophetic ones

1223
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,929
occurs to all these questions I

1224
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:21,280
understand that microbe understand micro

1225
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:23,529
functional group understand their

1226
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,510
limitations once you understand what

1227
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:27,100
these groups do you can use them with

1228
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,570
precision and confidence and that's kind

1229
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:30,610
of what we're trying to do this is all

1230
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,760
panel we're understanding educating and

1231
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:35,440
supporting that movement through

1232
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,840
deploying microbes with confidence of

1233
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,159
precision over but not all microbes work

1234
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,980
in every circumstance and that all

1235
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:44,319
functional groups are good for all plant

1236
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:46,059
health benefits different microbes do

1237
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,650
different things to benefit plants of

1238
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:52,840
different ways so I think it's again

1239
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:55,210
comes down to an education camp I don't

1240
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:58,780
buy a lot of products but my clients do

1241
00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:00,579
on my small patient grow at my home I

1242
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,800
just make everything I make my compost

1243
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:04,989
teas I make my ki inputs I just make

1244
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,120
them and so I don't buy it but people

1245
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:08,909
who rely on my opinion do spend a lot of

1246
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:13,029
money on it and I tell them two things

1247
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:14,319
number one if you've got your product

1248
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:16,510
that you think you're going to want to

1249
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,309
buy go to their website and almost

1250
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:20,560
everybody has got a picture of their

1251
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:23,889
label right so you can get a very

1252
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:25,960
specific breakdown of what's in it then

1253
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:28,329
go ahead and pour yourself a cocktail or

1254
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,670
smokeable and then Google every one of

1255
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:33,730
those inputs and learn what they are

1256
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:36,280
you're gonna make yourself a better

1257
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:38,829
person at your job you will be way more

1258
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:41,290
interesting at cocktail parties and you

1259
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:43,779
will know that product inside and out

1260
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:45,400
and if you choose to buy it you will

1261
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,589
know why you're gonna buy it

1262
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,910
plus you'll notice

1263
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:49,219
as you go through a couple of these

1264
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:51,659
products in the same product category

1265
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:53,548
you'll find that different products have

1266
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:55,379
got something more than others so if

1267
00:54:53,548 --> 00:54:58,710
something costs a little bit more

1268
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:00,420
you'd be like oh I see why it costs more

1269
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:02,009
because it's got this one product in it

1270
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,229
that I know things that we commedia what

1271
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:06,539
it actually does so don't be short on

1272
00:55:04,228 --> 00:55:10,259
your homework and number two if you are

1273
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:13,769
scaling at a commercial size the get

1274
00:55:10,259 --> 00:55:15,389
past the marketing people at the before

1275
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:17,669
you had really commit to a product in

1276
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:19,440
your farm call the company and it has to

1277
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:22,108
be taught ask to talk to their Colin

1278
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,579
right and find out what the science is

1279
00:55:22,108 --> 00:55:24,808
all about they want to talk to you

1280
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:26,670
especially if they think that you're

1281
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:29,400
gonna buy a ton of this every year

1282
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:31,559
forever right then they're dying for

1283
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,749
your money so call them up and say hey

1284
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,640
I've got this position at this company

1285
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:38,068
we are thinking about going in there

1286
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:40,978
like 55-gallon barrel size of your

1287
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:42,358
product and and I'd love to have you

1288
00:55:40,978 --> 00:55:44,278
know twenty thirty minutes of your time

1289
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:45,929
to talk about it with with the

1290
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:47,699
scientists right you get them on the

1291
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:50,759
phone and you tell them that and you say

1292
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:52,739
pitch me the science they're gonna be so

1293
00:55:50,759 --> 00:55:54,748
elated to talk to you it's going to be

1294
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:56,699
crazy when you're done with your

1295
00:55:54,748 --> 00:55:58,919
internet research and after talking to

1296
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:01,228
that person you will be able to buy that

1297
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,639
product or a competitor's product with

1298
00:56:01,228 --> 00:56:07,318
confidence knowing that you're doing it

1299
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:10,048
the right way yeah thing I could say

1300
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:13,048
mainly is that I more of the better for

1301
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:15,480
microbes we try to employ as many as we

1302
00:56:13,048 --> 00:56:18,550
can into our soil and

1303
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,190
even the highest concentration that we

1304
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:26,619
can find what I did find is trying to

1305
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:28,570
use multiple micro blinds is that there

1306
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:30,519
was a lot of repetition so I think

1307
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:32,619
that's the number one thing to be

1308
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:34,449
cautious of if you're going with

1309
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:36,550
different brands is just make sure that

1310
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:40,689
you have a variety and you're not going

1311
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:42,190
with the same microbes over again this

1312
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,079
is good you guys are answering some of

1313
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,000
the questions on here without me having

1314
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:52,869
to ask them so that's really helpful

1315
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:55,510
we don't mind exactly but so does

1316
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:58,150
implementing a thriving soil environment

1317
00:56:55,510 --> 00:57:05,830
pose a threat to biosecurity of an

1318
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:09,400
indoor grill implementing a thriving

1319
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:12,789
soil environment pose a threat to

1320
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,900
biosecurity of an indoor grill so if

1321
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:15,789
you're trying to have healthy living

1322
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:19,240
soils indoors is there going to be a

1323
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:21,219
threat to try to biosecurity so I only

1324
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:23,789
would have one example for that and that

1325
00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:28,118
is if you are making your compost teas

1326
00:57:23,789 --> 00:57:31,059
inside and they have got some sort of

1327
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:32,619
manure a compound component because when

1328
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:35,108
you're making compost teas or you're

1329
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:37,358
fermenting you're essentially incubating

1330
00:57:35,108 --> 00:57:39,098
right so you're taking your source

1331
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,440
material and you're giving it an

1332
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:44,559
environment so the life gets you know

1333
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,720
like 2 times 3 times 100 times X right

1334
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:50,139
and if you've got the e.coli in there

1335
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:53,588
suddenly your compost tea is going to be

1336
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:56,440
very very dangerous and so I'm not a big

1337
00:57:53,588 --> 00:57:59,079
fan of putting manures in my compost

1338
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,789
teas I love worm castings but but I will

1339
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:02,099
add that stuff

1340
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:04,710
separately something that has not been

1341
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:05,759
incubated but as far as I heard the

1342
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:11,849
question that would be the only thing

1343
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:16,560
that would jump for me the only thing I

1344
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:19,769
could think of do is indoors and making

1345
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,389
compost teas would just be the chlorine

1346
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:22,829
dr. Walter that's the number one thing I

1347
00:58:21,389 --> 00:58:25,199
can think of is just making sure that

1348
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:26,909
that's out of there that's gonna hurt

1349
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:45,149
your biology more than anything as far

1350
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:46,829
as I know indoors and just add to that I

1351
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,300
think I think that's Drupal I'll

1352
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:50,789
reiterate what I said you know most

1353
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,260
microbes are good but there are some

1354
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:54,119
pathogens out there mostly associated

1355
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,490
with legal material that coliforms

1356
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:57,779
e.coli Salmonella and we want to be

1357
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:59,489
careful of those and when we're working

1358
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,680
with microbes especially in a compost

1359
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:03,239
tea I love compost teas the only

1360
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,039
criticism I would have this is an

1361
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:07,049
academic criticism it's a little bit of

1362
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:09,420
an unknown we don't know what's growing

1363
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:10,980
in those every time almost always get

1364
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,610
good result but if you test them it's

1365
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,349
gonna be different

1366
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:15,450
almost every single time because there's

1367
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:17,849
variability with seasonality with the

1368
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:18,750
open environment I'm a microbiologist

1369
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:21,360
having berlanger

1370
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:23,880
a long long time and I could reliably

1371
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:26,280
make the same compost every time just if

1372
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,769
I didn't have a clothes dedicated

1373
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,390
sterile system to do that and we just

1374
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:32,550
don't do that I've seen them open so

1375
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:35,969
that's just a little uncertainty and

1376
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:37,680
they know we are having this consistency

1377
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:40,259
and consistent in goods and defined

1378
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:43,230
inputs really mitigates at risk there's

1379
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:45,030
the biosafety or the bio whatever that's

1380
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,860
that's not a challenge another person

1381
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:50,160
asked me once a couple people did you

1382
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:51,900
know bacteria actually in fact the roots

1383
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,210
and go up into the flowers and some

1384
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,559
states are actually bacterial see if you

1385
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:57,510
counts that you have to test for the

1386
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:59,579
flower that's a real challenge in some

1387
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:03,090
of these states you have to be be aware

1388
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:04,769
I wouldn't use concentrated microbial

1389
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:08,640
products as all their applications

1390
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:11,039
especially during bloom maybe in veg no

1391
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:14,460
longer than that because your your

1392
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,079
engineering higher bacteria on the leaf

1393
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:18,030
tissue and that's gonna that's gonna

1394
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,549
measure and that's gonna read and so

1395
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:22,710
that is putting your facility in your

1396
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:25,220
flower rest calendar if you can deliver

1397
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:27,630
microbes in the soil or I think you know

1398
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:29,069
99.99 nectar so that my group to do well

1399
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:30,390
they interact with roots it's where

1400
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,850
they've evolved it's where they lived

1401
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:34,529
they were involved in plants and so if

1402
01:00:32,849 --> 01:00:35,849
you can get them in the soil you're

1403
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:38,130
gonna have a thriving healthy

1404
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:39,210
environment that the plant will respond

1405
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,970
to very positively

1406
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:43,980
you know the microbes colonize the world

1407
01:00:41,969 --> 01:00:45,089
back here in particular hundreds of

1408
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,130
millions of years ago

1409
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:49,680
you know they created an environment for

1410
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:51,680
plants to evolve plants have always

1411
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,169
lived

1412
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:56,269
well I think it's interesting is to

1413
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:59,570
provide that agriculture let's have a

1414
01:00:56,269 --> 01:01:03,019
healthy living microbial community or

1415
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:05,450
living soil that the plants can engage

1416
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:09,489
with because it does show good results

1417
01:01:05,449 --> 01:01:14,139
for you know by Health and you

1418
01:01:09,489 --> 01:01:14,139
awesome thank you so much

1419
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:23,250
[Applause]

1420
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:30,549
you
