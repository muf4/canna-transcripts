1
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:13,169
so hey Jeff thank you so much for taking

2
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,808
a couple minutes away from Indo Expo to

3
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,448
come over and talk to me about the hash

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,219
star system so you know I've just

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,750
recently gotten into hatch a lot more

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,479
than I used to be and I'm starting to

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,460
learn how the the star system works in

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,679
real life now right because when you see

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,380
stuff it's really a lot different than

10
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:33,329
than hearing the star system just like

11
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,729
in theory right so I'm talking with Jeff

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,259
about it and and he starts giving me all

13
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,849
these details about like where it came

14
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,500
from and stuff like oh hold on dude we

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,770
need to go and get in front of a camera

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,359
and and do this straight up because I'm

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,530
sure that I'm not the only person who

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,750
has not heard this story

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,850
so anyway Jeff so so well I'm just gonna

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,640
give you the floor where did the hash

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,280
star system come from yes of the star

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,439
system came from the bazaar brothers

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:06,960
down in Oakland California it's you know

24
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:10,469
I want to say like 2010 was was when it

25
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,109
started up what they had was a measure Z

26
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:16,950
Club and a measure Z Club was a place

27
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:19,109
that you could go to and in private you

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,629
could have a club where you're consuming

29
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,280
cannabis and you're selling cannabis in

30
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,429
Oakland and it was the lowest

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,930
enforceable priority so measure Z made

32
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,500
cannabis consumption the lowest

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,620
enforcement

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:37,109
well priority these guys opened up the

35
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:39,900
bazaar and at the bazaar you know they

36
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:43,500
were selling hash and it really kind of

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,680
just had one price at first like all ash

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,819
was you know whether it's just you know

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,760
the lowest quality Keith tumbled forever

40
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,819
you know or it's that really really nice

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,310
bubble hash it was all the same price

42
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,679
and so they said no this is not how it

43
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,579
should be we need to have a quality

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,350
based rating system and so they came up

45
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,439
with the star rating system it's a one

46
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,120
through six star ratings so the they so

47
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:16,020
do we want to plug who those humans are

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:20,189
yeah I mean you know my buddy space

49
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,770
and my buddy Korpi were really the the

50
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,479
ones that kind of solidified that that

51
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,520
started all system down we want to get

52
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,399
that history right yeah you know I mean

53
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,070
that just just amazing folks they've

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,689
they've got real love for hash have been

55
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:39,569
making hash for many many years you know

56
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:42,030
space and I started making hash probably

57
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,219
right around the same time and you know

58
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,680
traveled down the the west coast with

59
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:51,870
bubble bags like 2000 and 2001 so like

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,790
really early on so now they've got this

61
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,340
Club yeah and they and all the stuff is

62
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,799
being sold is the same but it's not yeah

63
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,750
so so basically so here I'll just break

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,240
into what the star rating system is so

65
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,009
you got a one through six one being the

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,110
lowest six being the highest

67
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:12,629
so one star and so let me let me just

68
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,230
preface this with everything is based on

69
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:18,900
a pressed piece of hash so you take the

70
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:21,840
hash and you press it with heat and

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,250
pressure so you know just mild mild you

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,810
don't need you know like a rosin press

73
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,810
or you mean your hand yeah just like

74
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,479
your hand you know or maybe a little bit

75
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,219
warmer you could hold it up to like in

76
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,869
front of your heater or something like

77
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,409
that for just a little a little bit to

78
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:42,180
warm it up and press it and then it

79
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:45,479
smoked on a stainless steel screen and a

80
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,990
pipe so that's how how all of this is

81
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:53,909
rated and it's based on the melt and so

82
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:56,459
one star is no melt it will not press

83
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,159
together with heat and pressure meaning

84
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,469
it's just falling apart yes it just

85
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,560
falls apart there's nothing hope binding

86
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:07,859
it together it's mostly just green plant

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,750
material right you know maybe a lot of

88
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:15,209
stock very little resin to it and and so

89
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,500
that's kind of the lowest end of it you

90
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,329
could probably press that with like a

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,740
jack press or something like that and

92
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:27,449
get it into a puck but you know and then

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:29,290
a 2-star easily presses with heat and

94
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,839
pressure so you're gonna

95
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,600
have it pressed together and when you

96
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,569
smoke that on a screen it's going to

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,879
basically retain whatever shape it is

98
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:43,060
that it's in when you put it onto the

99
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:46,149
screen so you you light it up and just

100
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:50,199
really gently smoke it you might see a

101
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:51,909
little sheen or maybe a tiny little bit

102
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,310
of melting bubble to it

103
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,439
but but it doesn't really move it stays

104
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,540
in that same shape I've seen that before

105
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,430
I'd have like a little ball and then I'd

106
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,010
light it and it kind of burns down and

107
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,009
then it's still a like a little bit yes

108
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:08,500
exact shape in the end but just a shred

109
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:11,189
and then and that's that's because all

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,189
that ash is the contaminant the oil

111
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:17,560
Milt's I see right so so then you have a

112
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,779
three star and 3 star is really getting

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,240
into you know where you have a little

114
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:24,819
bit higher quality hashish it's it's

115
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,740
better than just the average hash at

116
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:34,000
that point and three star will go from

117
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:37,509
whatever shape it's in it will boil into

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,180
basically a lump right so so if you have

119
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:43,899
it in a flat kind of sheet that you've

120
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,379
you've pressed out they'll kind of come

121
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:51,250
together right

122
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:57,219
it leaves cannabis haystack formation of

123
00:05:51,250 --> 00:06:00,850
ash in the end then four star will melt

124
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,420
down into a puddle and leave kind of

125
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,250
like it'll come from wherever it's at

126
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,890
rapidly boiling all over there's bubbles

127
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,939
you know clear domes everywhere okay

128
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:18,839
hopefully if that's nice dry hash and

129
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:23,230
and it will come down to an even flat

130
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:25,989
bit of ash not like the two star where

131
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,569
there's like a ton of ash there but just

132
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,990
like a nice little even

133
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:34,270
of ash but it's all flat

134
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,610
there's no haystack it didn't kind of

135
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:39,248
melt and then can't clump together but

136
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:42,098
you know before it was able to go down

137
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:44,379
it had spent all of its oil on a three

138
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:45,490
star but the four star has more - able

139
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:49,179
to kind of get out there

140
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:54,968
and four star is actually the first star

141
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:56,438
that I would ever attempt to dab now

142
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:59,199
granted you've got a lot of plant

143
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,209
material still left and a four star and

144
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,499
so it's not really the best thing to be

145
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:05,168
dad they're gonna want to be cleaning

146
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:07,059
afterwards yeah oh yeah there's gonna be

147
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:10,990
you're gonna be using several q-tips to

148
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:12,759
clean out your banger right for sure but

149
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:18,158
then then we can go to a five-star

150
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:22,838
five-star it melts down and it does this

151
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:26,199
unique thing that where it creates one

152
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:29,228
big clear dome and it pushes any

153
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,389
contaminant that's there so the things

154
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:35,079
that aren't melting in your bubble hash

155
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:37,930
it pushes them out to the ledges array

156
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,058
of that clear dome and the screen in the

157
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,680
center of the clear dome is visible

158
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,300
because there's no contaminant on it

159
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,399
there's just this outer ring of

160
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,439
contaminant and when you smoke that down

161
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,019
that's what you're left with you're left

162
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:54,218
with visible screen with with an outer

163
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:56,649
ring of contaminant and that dad fairly

164
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:58,658
well still has that contaminant but you

165
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:01,838
know it's it's it's a lot better to dab

166
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:04,718
five star than four star you know you

167
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:07,509
can go a little bit warmer and not have

168
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:10,329
to worry about burning as much kind of

169
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:12,098
cellulose in your tap we're just you

170
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:17,408
know four star could be tricky you want

171
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:21,218
to be really low low temp and then that

172
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:24,490
leads us to six star and six star will

173
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:27,129
just rapidly melt down it's boiling like

174
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,459
crazy and it just melts through the

175
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:33,430
screen and there's little to no residue

176
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:36,339
kind of in like different spots if there

177
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:38,049
is residue it's not like all collected

178
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:40,449
up anywhere it just kind of like you

179
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,059
know just a suggestion it was even there

180
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:44,639
you

181
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:47,129
and yeah and that's that's really the

182
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,039
Holy Grail and so you know back in the

183
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:53,879
day when the star system was created six

184
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:57,000
star was not a thing that was had every

185
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,490
day today you can get six star all the

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,399
time yeah because you know hash makers

187
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:07,080
of advanced and and they've they've

188
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,750
really stepped up their game to be able

189
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,430
to make everything into a city star

190
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:17,159
right so you can take you know and do

191
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:20,699
fresh frozen material and up the the

192
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:23,939
star but back in the day it was like the

193
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,030
unicorn the six star was like you'd get

194
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,470
one and that was it and then you

195
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:32,569
couldn't have another one for a long

196
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:36,210
time and it had to be that right variety

197
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:40,230
and yeah alright so a couple questions

198
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:44,460
yes so the first question is is so it

199
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:46,860
can can can ash degrade can it can it

200
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,800
like when it was made it was this

201
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,570
particular star but because of a droves

202
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:57,629
are taken care of right or what can it

203
00:09:51,570 --> 00:10:01,140
slide down the scale well okay so yes

204
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:05,669
ash degrades over time it becomes less

205
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:09,929
potent a four star may become a three or

206
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:13,049
a three and a half star potentially but

207
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:18,089
I actually have some hash that that I

208
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:21,500
just found that was stashed from like it

209
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:27,389
must have been mm I don't know maybe

210
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:29,759
2012 a long time ago and it's a four

211
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,740
star that was unintentionally cured yeah

212
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,450
yeah it's a four star excessive hum

213
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,490
there and when you smoke it I would

214
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:39,810
actually judge it still today as a four

215
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:43,019
start yeah um you know and it just

216
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:45,569
doesn't have the flavor anymore but a

217
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,059
lot of the Terps are gone so I bet when

218
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,280
when it was rated a 4 star it was

219
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,769
probably a high 4 star and now it's like

220
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,269
a you know just a four star it's a solid

221
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:57,299
four star but you know

222
00:10:54,269 --> 00:11:00,350
that's an interesting thing the the star

223
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:02,519
system as we described it it's all about

224
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,230
physicality and nothing about being an

225
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,240
Avery or two certainties

226
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,428
like that and that's just a that's that

227
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,278
that was to give everybody an even

228
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:13,289
playing field that they could could you

229
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,509
know work with you know so theoretically

230
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:17,578
you could have a five or six star that

231
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,829
actually doesn't taste very good

232
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:22,708
it does incredible things in the pipe

233
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:23,789
but it actually is kind of not so tasty

234
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:29,188
if it was handled wrong

235
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:31,019
well sorry so um so you know hash is is

236
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,328
like you know kind of two family trees

237
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,528
at least at this point right you got the

238
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:36,239
people we're pressing them together and

239
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,610
making temple balls and bricks and funds

240
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,159
that you love that stuff yeah but then I

241
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,220
also you know more often I am getting to

242
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,558
takes this like blonde not oxidized

243
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,540
sandy stuff that folks are making

244
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:50,458
freeze-dried and then they're hitting in

245
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:55,049
the yeah they're they're they're they're

246
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:57,359
doing live froze those make you fresh

247
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,969
frozen and freeze-dried right yeah and

248
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,379
and you get this like sandy magic stuff

249
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,509
and you're like it's like it's

250
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,188
impressive to look at and tastes good

251
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:07,259
you've got to make it in a cold room

252
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:09,178
yeah I mean the resident doesn't stick

253
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,009
together while you're selected one of

254
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:13,350
the trays we I mean it's so where does

255
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:17,068
that fall in this scale well you know I

256
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,290
mean so so so I feel like a lot of that

257
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:23,399
stuff's hitting the six-star you know

258
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:26,159
and and you know a lot of that really

259
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,798
really good stuff isn't even being

260
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:33,480
smoked as hash anymore it's being

261
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:36,659
pressed into rosin yeah and man I would

262
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,329
dab either the rosin or that I you know

263
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,669
I love hash rosin it's definitely my

264
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:44,609
favorite thing to dab yeah at the moment

265
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:46,798
you know so but yeah it's kind of crazy

266
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,928
yeah there's there's a lot of really

267
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:51,269
good hash out there now right on one

268
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:53,789
more question so um so I was talking

269
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:54,928
about the star system with my buddy the

270
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:56,639
other day and I told him I was gonna

271
00:12:54,928 --> 00:13:00,119
interview you when when we came here to

272
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,039
Colorado and and he's like oh you know

273
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:04,410
I've even heard about seven and eight

274
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,240
star now

275
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:10,389
so what's the story this is their next

276
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,509
level this coming along so so like so

277
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,818
we've got the six star that solidified

278
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:18,399
as the ceiling for bubble hash right

279
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:20,919
like that is the best that you can do is

280
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,850
seven right and so six

281
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:28,299
rb6 I'm sorry thank you very much yeah

282
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:32,740
so the best that you can do is six so it

283
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:36,250
started right around the time when rosin

284
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:39,750
King came around and it was at the same

285
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:42,669
time when people were introducing Terps

286
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,240
into saltless extracts and things like

287
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:45,909
that you know

288
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,159
cannabis derived terpenes like blue

289
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,149
river terpenes and things like yeah I

290
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,240
remember

291
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,399
Horatio on hash Church said you know the

292
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,870
seventh star or something like that you

293
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,100
know he was he was like oh this is the

294
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:02,049
seventh star and it's it's kind of like

295
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,409
it's a play off the star system be like

296
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:08,438
no this is better than that right and so

297
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:12,009
a lot of people they call their rosin

298
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:13,808
seven star right because it's it's you

299
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:16,028
know because beyond as you've removed

300
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:20,318
you've religious the waxy trichome outer

301
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:24,338
yes you've removed the non cannabinoid

302
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:26,588
and non Torpy it is resin only yeah

303
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:29,110
you've removed any Sully Li up this

304
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,759
cellulose you've removed yeah yeah

305
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,438
interesting because like you you kind of

306
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,438
just describe two different Forks in the

307
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:38,379
road right the the you know pressing it

308
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:40,208
into hash rosin that's a pretty good

309
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:43,120
case for a seventh star the fact that

310
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:44,649
you took six star and you removed the

311
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,299
outside of the tricone you're left with

312
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:50,649
just the inside of the trichomes i I

313
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:55,149
would rather somebody say this is raw

314
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:58,000
hash rosin made from this stuff like six

315
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:00,970
star or we make a lot of hash rosin from

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,799
four star yeah so you know we do all dry

317
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,209
trim bubble hash we don't do the fresh

318
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,818
frozen so it's harder to hit those

319
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:09,128
higher numbers and when we do you know

320
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:11,409
get a four star we'll press it up you

321
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:13,509
know some good hashbrowns the other the

322
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:15,338
other side though where you're where

323
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,960
you're adding terpenes right that are

324
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,990
not

325
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,759
indigenous to that particular run like

326
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,950
like like like adding blood river or

327
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,409
something like now like like it's almost

328
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,970
like a different product to me right as

329
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:29,519
you're moving up you're actually

330
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,690
removing things from your hash

331
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,039
experience right

332
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,800
yeah no first you're getting rid of the

333
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,000
the the plant material and then as you

334
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,469
go up then you're getting rid of ash

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,450
yeah then you're getting rid of if

336
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,019
there's even anything in the pipe when

337
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,140
you're done

338
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,909
but then adding you know you know not to

339
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,350
diss on that no just to say it seems

340
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:49,049
like a different product now well so I

341
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:54,600
think that that was really just you know

342
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:57,809
the evolution of hash right we were were

343
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,790
now taking this hash we've got this you

344
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:02,759
know really nice kind of bass we've got

345
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:04,860
a great hash pressing into rosin and

346
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,889
then people adding turps into that

347
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,100
that's just a further further step of

348
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:13,710
alchemy right and do I really like

349
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,290
super-high chirp stuff no that's why I

350
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:20,759
actually like hash rosin is because hash

351
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:24,179
rosin versus flower rosin right has way

352
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,669
less terpene content it's got a great

353
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:29,159
terpene content don't get me wrong but

354
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:33,089
it's got way less it's less harsh on my

355
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:36,419
asthmatic lungs and it's just easier for

356
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:39,180
me to consume there's also in flour

357
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,519
rosin you have lipids that are contained

358
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:44,489
within the plant material that aren't

359
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,730
contained within the resin heads right

360
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,830
so there's all these lipids and there's

361
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,899
all these terpene glands that you don't

362
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,320
extract into hashish because you're just

363
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:57,419
you're looking for the bulbous trichome

364
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,970
and you're freezing it and removing that

365
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:03,750
that's that's what you get in bubble

366
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,299
hash right and but if you press the

367
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,250
flower rosin it's really an expression

368
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:11,220
of that entire so are you really saying

369
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:15,390
that if you press the flower you're

370
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:18,000
actually getting a larger and maybe more

371
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,640
intense chirping profile then if you

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,200
just press the hash oh yeah I got test

373
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,800
results I can show you to prove it all

374
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,569
right

375
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:30,509
my follow-up would be are there terpenes

376
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,339
that we want in the flower that are that

377
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:34,500
are not in the hash I always thought

378
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:37,559
that it once you removed the hash and

379
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,839
you made the the hash rosin that you

380
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,359
need any taste that you'd be leaving

381
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,909
behind is any kind of grassy plant

382
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:48,750
material taste and so by using doing the

383
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:50,850
hash drogyn you're getting the pure pure

384
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,960
of all the terpenes you wanted but your

385
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:55,409
sounds like you're saying that I'm

386
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,610
leaving some in the flour you're leaving

387
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:03,360
a bunch in the flour okay so it's a

388
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:05,689
really interesting thing take it I don't

389
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,609
know if you have access to still four

390
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:11,850
essential oil sure Yeah right

391
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:13,859
take your spent hash material your sugar

392
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:15,569
leaf that you've you've processed you've

393
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,259
done all your however many runs are

394
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,169
going to do with it

395
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:21,809
take that spent material and steam

396
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,400
distill it and check out the amount of

397
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,819
terpenes that you get from it

398
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:30,360
Wow and and and it's it's very similar

399
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:32,519
to what you would get if you were to

400
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,459
just steam distill the material before

401
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,920
you ran it for a bubble yeah and and so

402
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,529
what what happens is you've got terpenes

403
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,259
and cannabinoids and and really you've

404
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:45,000
got a large concentration of

405
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,740
cannabinoids and you have these terpenes

406
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,410
and there's phenol so there's all kinds

407
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:53,190
of things in the resin head but they're

408
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:55,250
kind of in this solidified thing you

409
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:59,220
know when the plant gets rubbed up on

410
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,779
its gonna release it but down below that

411
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,180
on the surface of the plant material

412
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:06,809
there's different glands that are you

413
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:09,000
know like ten micron in size and they

414
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:11,099
don't produce cattle cannabinoids but

415
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,369
they do produce lipids and terpene

416
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:17,819
interesting and so the terpenes are

417
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:20,309
volatize out of them constantly where

418
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:22,889
the resin head it's kind of sealed for

419
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:25,500
the most part you know and so so that's

420
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,590
where the terpenes that the plants using

421
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,599
for what whatever it's producing these

422
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:33,799
terpenes for right you know that that's

423
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,539
where they're coming out of mostly and

424
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,299
yeah

425
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:40,849
but that same pretty much the same

426
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:46,269
profile is contained within the resin

427
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:50,679
head of the of the trichome yeah so I

428
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:56,329
don't know if it's like losing out on it

429
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:58,759
or just not getting it and enjoying the

430
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,960
hashish for what it is yeah it's almost

431
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,240
just like a different way to serve it

432
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,329
right yeah what came to my mind was like

433
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,430
sushi versus sashimi yeah like maybe you

434
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,199
want the whole flour rosin but sometimes

435
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,660
maybe you just want the topping yeah

436
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,440
yeah and and you know so like you look

437
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:18,200
at BHO or co2 or any solvent extract

438
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,590
you're gonna have all of the the

439
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,750
terpenes extracted with that extraction

440
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:25,279
so you're not just getting the terpenes

441
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,910
and the resin had like you do with

442
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:31,879
hashish like you're getting all of those

443
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:36,410
so it's it's it's kind of what sets

444
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:40,160
bubble hash apart and makes its hi so

445
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:43,550
unique you know it just it just seems

446
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:47,330
like such a refined high even better is

447
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:49,789
a solvent extract from bubble hash right

448
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:52,819
you know I think I've had that yeah yeah

449
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:56,389
you know that's always a fun one to do

450
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:59,990
for sure but I think you know I mean I

451
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:02,990
love rosin so much I think that the hash

452
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:05,000
rosin it's it's just the best for my

453
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,859
palate right now yeah cool man well

454
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,380
thank you for the explanation of the

455
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:10,819
star system and then also all this extra

456
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,010
stuff at the end I didn't expect which

457
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:15,970
was really really cool

458
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:15,970
yeah thank you very much

459
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,769
you
