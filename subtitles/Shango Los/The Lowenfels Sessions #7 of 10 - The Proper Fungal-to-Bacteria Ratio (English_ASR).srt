1
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,710
things whenever you do presentation

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,750
you're always very clear to point out

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,368
that there's a lot of active debate a

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,469
lot of these topics and I think that's

5
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,449
very fair and you'll often give both

6
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,589
sides and kind of give your opinion on

7
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,528
what you think is gonna end up being

8
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,689
right over time in the science and one

9
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:36,869
of those hot debates right now is the

10
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:39,479
bacteria to fungal ratio in soil and oh

11
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,729
my god like the online debates are like

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,738
a bloodsport you know it's crazy yeah

13
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,959
and so you know you're a nice

14
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,718
even-handed guy so I would appreciate if

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,030
you would give us a general overview of

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,739
what the debate looks like so people

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,239
have email contacts true and then give

18
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,729
us an idea where you think that it's

19
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,159
gonna end up being played out for Canada

20
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:00,928
specific right right right well first of

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,779
all for those who don't know anything

22
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,210
about fungal bacterial relation your

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,909
soil is usually dominated by either

24
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:13,439
fungus or it is dominated by bacteria

25
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:17,630
and if it's dominated by fungus then it

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,609
it likes the ammonia type back a

27
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:23,728
fertilizer or microbe where I should say

28
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:26,819
and if it's if it's got a bacterial

29
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:32,759
dominance it likes the nitrate type so

30
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:36,599
there's two kinds of nitrogen also else

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,909
have a balance of these by the way if it

32
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,819
has more fungi than bacteria in his

33
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:46,340
acidic in nature if it has more bacteria

34
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:50,158
than fungi it is a basic or an alkaline

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,978
and if it is bacteria it has matrix in

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,579
fixing bacteria that fixed the nitrogen

37
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:59,968
so there are those differences your

38
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:03,478
soils have one of the other or dominance

39
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:04,709
but they BA they have both of them so

40
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,899
there's always some fungi and bacteria

41
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,060
so I'll advise a person unless you at

42
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,159
the very far ends of the spectrum now

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,960
when we first started talking about this

44
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,389
dump and the concept really has been

45
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,040
developed by dr. Elaine Ingham who is a

46
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:20,129
goddess among mortals as far as I'm

47
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,409
concerned and and I never want to put

48
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,139
words in their mouth but dr. leading

49
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:27,090
them showed us about fungal bacterial

50
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:30,089
ratio and explained to us

51
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,310
that if you are in a beginning

52
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,920
analogical situation when I call the

53
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,080
beach you know when life is just

54
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,759
beginning as opposed to the old-growth

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,230
forest which is the other end of the

56
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,659
spectrum when you're in that beach end

57
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:45,299
you have bacteria there is nothing

58
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,419
really for the fungi to eat and as

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,739
things grow and develop you start to get

60
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:52,289
detritus and the bunch I move in and as

61
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,379
you move further along that spectrum or

62
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:57,659
more contact the bacteria number

63
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,829
basically stays the same when you get

64
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,500
all the way over to the old-growth

65
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,719
forest you've got so much stuff with a

66
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,439
bunch of heat that fungi dominate the

67
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,729
soil 50,001 I mean they really they

68
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,979
really go nuts so you've got those two

69
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,840
ends of the spectrum and in order to

70
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,719
know what your plant lights you figure

71
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,930
out where along that spectrum you get

72
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:22,439
I suspect that debate started this way

73
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,620
that was too difficult for me to figure

74
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,870
out doctor Healing is a lot smarter than

75
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,000
me I promise you and that was just too

76
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,469
difficult for me to figure out so so I

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,719
came up with this idea because I was

78
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:36,239
giving talks to regular gardeners not

79
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,150
intelligent highly intelligent cannabis

80
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,670
growers and so I had to dumb down the

81
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,659
system and I came up with this idea that

82
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:48,599
if you grow things for less than a year

83
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:50,729
they like bacteria dominated soil and

84
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,519
basically when you look at the spectrum

85
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:56,608
the doctor lien has sure that's that's

86
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,969
what happens if you grow things for more

87
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:02,370
than a year perennials and trees and

88
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:05,879
shrubs they tend to want finally

89
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,400
dominated soil and and so I've got this

90
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,769
slide fungal dominated it is more than a

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,870
year less than a year isn't it is

92
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,539
bacteria dominated what does cannabis

93
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,209
cannabis is less than a year cannabis

94
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:21,629
actively dominated says Jeff Lauren felt

95
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,970
now dr. Elena again a lot smarter than I

96
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:26,939
am I think she's done some some research

97
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,910
and she's decided that no really

98
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,410
cannabis has a little bit higher

99
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,060
bacterial I mean a fungal ratio than

100
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,860
bacteria

101
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,199
I'm willing to accept that then doesn't

102
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,500
bother me at all I wouldn't accept

103
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,240
anything dr. Elaine says frankly but she

104
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,889
really what she has done for the world

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,009
is phenomenal as far as I'm concerned

106
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:49,050
but yeah so maybe a little bit more

107
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,490
bacterial now last night when we talked

108
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,370
about all the fun yeah does a new race

109
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,050
car of cannabis oh they are so fast and

110
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,189
I it's hard for me to believe that they

111
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:02,629
want to back to have fungally dominated

112
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:02,629
soil will experiment and find it out but

113
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,639
versus the bacteria makes it makes sense

114
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:10,860
how do you get it bacteria like green

115
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,728
things they like sweet things you know

116
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,348
molasses straw hay you know that kind of

117
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:18,029
stuff is they grasp with all the green

118
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,949
mulches there's all the green folks

119
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:23,250
isn't then the bacteria the fungi like

120
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:25,500
the brown mulches and so you can you can

121
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,300
use those so so bifur folks are not

122
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,579
brown mulches we're talking things like

123
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,710
like wood chips and Dinny and just leave

124
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,019
leaves and yeah yeah yeah leaves I go

125
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:35,399
out and just pump bunch of leaves off my

126
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,930
yard make sure they're not oak leaves

127
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,870
because those are allopathic to a lot of

128
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,168
plants but yeah and then the more you

129
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,180
grind them up the more bacterially the

130
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:48,060
bacterial oriented they become so you

131
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,918
can take a follow food and and really

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,199
grind it up it becomes a bacterial food

133
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,430
so if you really wanted to do it right

134
00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:00,598
you get a fungal food grind it so it's

135
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:03,780
bacterial fungal so if if if folks want

136
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:05,610
to know which side they're dominant on

137
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,309
is this something that you can just get

138
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,259
from a simple soil test no that's one

139
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,470
way you need a soil food with this and

140
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,240
or microscope with your own you can get

141
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,160
a grid and try to figure it all out

142
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,329
or you can bottle something

143
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,460
and how do you find the soil food web

144
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:27,219
lab you google their wall around the

145
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:29,689
world that will give you your you're

146
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,610
right yeah cool thanks for taking apart

147
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,219
that debate for us okay right on the

148
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,050
probably cost

149
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,050
[Laughter]

150
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,970
you
