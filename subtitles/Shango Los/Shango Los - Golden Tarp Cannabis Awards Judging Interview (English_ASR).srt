1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
hey everybody welcome back today we are

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,639
here with shingle loose and we are super

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,859
excited because he came all the way down

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:11,039
from Washington to see us he has a

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,830
podcast called shaping the fire and he

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,449
is the founder of Vashon Island

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:19,140
marijuana enthusiast Alliance it's a

8
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:21,000
really long name well first let's um the

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,980
podcast is actually shaping fire not

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,660
evil fart yet said shaping fire calm so

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,699
the Vashon Island marijuana

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,129
entrepreneurs Alliance was a trade

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,810
organization that started about five

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,869
years ago when medical was still in

15
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,820
Washington and and and what we did is we

16
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,829
found that so many of the growers on the

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,659
island were just selling against each

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,489
other on this on the island and so the

19
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,828
prices were crashing and we had on

20
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:46,468
familiar we had really great prices on

21
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,969
our island so I recognized this because

22
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,039
my friends raw growers I said let's

23
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,929
let's organize and start creating a

24
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,820
channel to dispensaries all around the

25
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,049
state so that's what we did ever all the

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,808
timers started working together and

27
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:00,238
group buying you know soil and nutrients

28
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,530
and things like that and and everybody

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:02,578
was happy because their prices went down

30
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,469
and the amount they got the further

31
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,299
flour went up unfortunately though

32
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,129
everything's changed now because they

33
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,409
killed medical in Washington tried to

34
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,149
roll it in so far unsuccessfully in

35
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,740
recreational and so all of those

36
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,859
heritage growers had to make a decision

37
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:19,679
about whether or not they wanted to just

38
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,030
stop being in cannabis or if they wanted

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,250
to go back to a black market and that's

40
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,840
a really hard decision for anybody to

41
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,368
make when this is something you've been

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,350
doing your whole life and it's why your

43
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,019
kids can go to summer camp right because

44
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,759
you've got this extra money yeah yeah

45
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,289
was that transition like when you talk

46
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,640
about this heritage transition to

47
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,340
commercial growing can you kind of touch

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,109
on that sure well originally when the

49
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,490
laws got passed they promised all the

50
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,618
medical people that they would have an

51
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,959
opportunity in the licensed cannabis

52
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,359
market and people were pretty skeptical

53
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,009
yeah promised right and unfortunately

54
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,578
what happened is that when when it

55
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,409
finally came time about the licenses

56
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:57,179
almost none of them were original

57
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,950
heritage medical people like just a

58
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,600
handful and it was it was a real

59
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,750
travesty they were more interested in

60
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,489
giving the money to a higher capitalized

61
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,649
folks from other industries when they

62
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,359
were making their qualification choices

63
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,318
right and so what they did is they took

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,989
a

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,169
preexisting you know it could use some

66
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:17,519
more regulation but you know it could a

67
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,378
pre-existing market with professionals

68
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,718
who already have the relationships set

69
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,518
them all aside and then install this

70
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:25,680
whole new system with all new people

71
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,780
from other industries and and you know a

72
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,060
lot of those companies hired medical

73
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,949
folk but but this is you know trying to

74
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,269
make good out of a difficult situation

75
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:37,560
and and the people who were with us

76
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,569
through the dark times and through

77
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,150
Prohibition who put in all the real work

78
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:47,908
over the decades most of those folks got

79
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:49,620
pushed out how does that well well where

80
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:51,509
I live on Vashon you know we went from

81
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,459
having a hundred and fifty six small

82
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:57,479
businesses that are all run by families

83
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,579
to having for larger licensed operations

84
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,709
right and you know the people who run

85
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,480
those operations on our island they're

86
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,340
actually very nice people right so we're

87
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,229
not against that but it's the fact that

88
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,299
so many people were pushed out and we're

89
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,098
no longer included right especially

90
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,319
since they're the people who who made

91
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:14,908
cannabis what it is right very similar

92
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,828
to what we're experiencing in the

93
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:18,989
Emerald triangle currently yeah well I

94
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,540
noticed yesterday the news that they

95
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,329
removed the one acre cap and that I mean

96
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,739
what that's going to do to shape

97
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,659
California cannabis is astonishing

98
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,219
you you've all the protections for

99
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:34,078
artisan growers for for specialty folks

100
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:35,489
yeah absolutely it's just a shame and so

101
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,169
they're gonna be supplanted by these

102
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,239
bigger folks I thought the idea to give

103
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:40,919
them five years to get the market set

104
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,469
for artists that was a really really

105
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,989
good idea I really wish that they had at

106
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,419
least given us the five year head start

107
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,810
ultimately it was why a lot of my family

108
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:53,069
and friends decided to go legal

109
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,430
I mean stepping from the black market

110
00:03:53,068 --> 00:04:00,179
into a transparent world is really hard

111
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,280
if it's all you go back go back you know

112
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,769
and I mean you just can't you know and

113
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,969
so having that that cap would are the

114
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,120
the five-year limit would have been

115
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:10,049
really nice but either way um we really

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,019
love what you're doing

117
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,750
we appreciate you not only can'

118
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,819
educating the consumer but also trying

119
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,858
to you know organize groups to kind of

120
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,930
help the people who that's all they've

121
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,859
ever known stay protecting the integrity

122
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,629
of the Kim

123
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,790
growers need somebody to defend them and

124
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,709
since I will not a grower myself but all

125
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,720
my friends are growers I figured it'd be

126
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,370
a good opportunity to help folks who you

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,870
know growers they spend so much time

128
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,310
with the plant they don't necessarily

129
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,750
want to be out there in the front I just

130
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,610
want to be a load and to do their craft

131
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,930
right and I figure out well it's

132
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,460
something I can do to help thanks really

133
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,110
awesome that's really great of you and

134
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:44,489
not not only do they you know the only

135
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,379
thing that they've been doing is is

136
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,840
growing and they do it considerably well

137
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,399
but now they're branding and becoming a

138
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,019
marketer and who do you sell I mean

139
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,029
there's all these other facets that have

140
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:55,529
come into that and so it's really nice

141
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:57,359
to hear that there are people like

142
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,879
yourself out there helping yeah you know

143
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,040
and it sounds like this podcast is a

144
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,418
platform that that you're using to get

145
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,770

152
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,889
the show recently talking about the

153
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,530
history of CBD and and where the

154
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:24,720
original plants came from and you know

155
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:26,549

not we're not really personality to bass

163
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:44,159
they're not they're not profile episodes

164
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:46,649
we take a different topic area every

165
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,810
week and the person speaks to that topic

166
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:52,699
so every episode is very educational

167
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:56,759
great yeah so it's a lot of fun Wow

168
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:58,409
exciting what else let's talk about

169
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,409
educating the consumer so we've been

170
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,060
having this big conversation about

171
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,180
terpenes versus THC do you want to touch

172
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,860
a little bit on this component well when

173
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,418
I was sitting out there in the judges

174
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,600
room earlier we were talking about how

175
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:14,399
helpful would be for every consumer to

176
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,530
have this kind of a judging experience

177
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,819
because it's so challenging when you're

178
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:20,069
first getting into cannabis and we're

179
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,839
all attracting all these new enthusiasts

180
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,099
now right yeah but you know they have to

181
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,829
they have to go and they have to spend

182
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,930
retail money to try one strain and then

183
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:29,639
retail money it's hard to build up your

184
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,560
experience like that if you're new

185
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,990
whereas you come to something like this

186
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,939
and I've got a whole bunch of samples in

187
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,740
front of me well I've got a

188
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,810
a really good understanding of what's

189
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,879
going on and you know probiotic like

190
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,259
Depp in in Northern California but by

191
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,269
the end of the time it would be great

192
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,550
that if anytime anybody comes into

193
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:50,459
cannabis we're like welcome to smoking

194
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,170
marijuana enjoy your sampler pack so you

195
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,209
can find out you know what you like what

196
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,509
works for you yeah absolutely no such a

197
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:59,189
great entry because it's hard when you

198
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,469
have to pay your you know 10 to 15

199
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,389
dollars a gram at a retail just to learn

200
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,190
what you like wouldn't that be nice if

201
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,839
we could access cannabis medicine in

202
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:08,610
that form because our brains are all

203
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,849
wired differently our experiences are

204
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,920
all wired differently we're arriving

205
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:16,830
differently on an individual 11 level

206
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:20,009
and so yeah I love that concept I think

207
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:25,139
we should push your scenario maybe get a

208
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:26,490
medical come to the tribe the other

209
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,139
thing I was laughing about as I was

210
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,460
walking up to chat with you too is that

211
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,310
um you know normally when you're at a

212
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,629
party and and and you've got your your

213
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,430
cannabis you like you don't want to say

214
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:38,040
leave it on a table somewhere but

215
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,949
there's so much out there because

216
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,169
everyone everybody's judging so much

217
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,089
that I'm like yeah my my stuff is safe

218
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:47,629
