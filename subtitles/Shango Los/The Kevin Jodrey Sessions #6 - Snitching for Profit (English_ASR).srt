1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,899
so this next question you know this is

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,150
definitely a hot topic around here in

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:11,830
Humboldt where we're talking today but

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,990
you know in the Simas transition folks

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,810
are getting their licenses and so

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,310
they're going full-on adult use rec but

7
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,349
there are other people who either

8
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,788
haven't gotten their licenses yet or

9
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:23,528
they're still getting their action

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,480
together to apply for their license and

11
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:27,189
what we're noticing is that some of

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,838
those people who will grab the brass

13
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:31,329
ring they've got their license they're

14
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:34,269
starting to turn in and snitch on other

15
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:36,460
people who are in the scene and have not

16
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,739
gotten their license yet and you know

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,870
you're known as you know you know your

18
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,488
your old-school heritage og grower but

19
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:46,328
also you're a Community Builder right

20
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:48,608
and so you know how what do you feel

21
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,859
about what's going on with people

22
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:51,850
throwing other people under the bus

23
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,190
simply because they haven't gotten their

24
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,179
license yet but at the same time you

25
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:57,248
know a lot of them aren't supposed to be

26
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,850
growing yet so so you know it's it's a

27
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:02,469
challenging conflict it's a it's a

28
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,170
concept of us we talked about earlier

29
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,549
scarcity in abundance and what you're

30
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,010
seeing is you're seeing people who are

31
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,739
basically snitching they're not from our

32
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:14,020
culture they're the they're the new wave

33
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:15,789
of people that come in and they're doing

34
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:17,920
normal business and to them normal

35
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,359
businesses to snuff out the black market

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,070
around you because those are competitors

37
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,260
therefore they cut into your margin and

38
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,909
you have shareholders you have investors

39
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,620
that need to be paid and that's how you

40
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:29,379
see it's very impersonal it's very

41
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,180
professional it's true business in the

42
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:33,879
way we know it in American capitalism

43
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,620
and the problem is that so many of us

44
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,849
that are in cannabis really were in a

45
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,439
different kind of business you're in a

46
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:40,539
communal business where you all

47
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,980
basically shared resources if you needed

48
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,170
product you could buy from each other

49
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,460
you help each other out you basically

50
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,049
would create each other's little safety

51
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:49,029
and security blanket and part of the

52
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,319
share the risks did you had the risk to

53
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,280
and you also made sure that you know you

54
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,569
weren't looking over your neighbor's

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,010
fence trying to rat him out for what he

56
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:56,349
did because you know wanted to reg well

57
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,609
so you you worked on this

58
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,839
kind of need each other and we also

59
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:02,019
would prefer if we didn't cause each

60
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,880
other problems and what yours really

61
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:06,399
seen is I think that the the majority of

62
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:08,909
people that are going after with the the

63
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,580
customer what do you call it um

64
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:14,199
complaint driven response so you contact

65
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,209
the Sheriff's Department you contact the

66
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,609
BCC and say look this is some unethical

67
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,379
operators that are doing this stuff

68
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,300
that's primarily all the new people and

69
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,219
because they don't have a connection to

70
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,650
the old game they don't have an

71
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:28,120
emotional situation that precludes them

72
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,069
from making these decisions and it's

73
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,230
chewing up all these people that are

74
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:34,060
trying to move forward but they're

75
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:36,340
slowed down because they lack the

76
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,689
capital and they lack so many of the

77
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,539
little pieces needed to move

78
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:42,159
expeditiously and so for me I just I

79
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,620
don't look at it as we're really enemies

80
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,870
I'd never have and I think that people

81
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,060
don't understand the level of competitor

82
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,200
that's coming and that if you looked at

83
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,030
your neighbor and thought that he was

84
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,379
stealing profit from you you should take

85
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,879
a good look down the road and when

86
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:56,919
Nabisco comes in and they're gonna steal

87
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,780
all of it from you now and if you could

88
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,879
not wrap your neighbor out you might

89
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,799
find that they were a valuable asset to

90
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,269
help you when you had problems that use

91
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,890
somebody that you could share genetic

92
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,260
ideas with that you could work with

93
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:10,059
creativity you could work with how do we

94
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:12,669
function and utilize each other's skill

95
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,560
sets and I think that in our area humble

96
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:15,849
County of the other counties like humb

97
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,349
all the communities that CommVault ware

98
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:21,849
was so much more group related it's the

99
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,139
way we've learned how to function and

100
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:24,669
survive and it's the way we need to

101
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,439
continue so I would discourage people

102
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:29,738
from snitching on their neighbors and

103
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,719
let the system do the job and ratting

104
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,640
doesn't help anybody in the long term

105
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,259
all it does is removes all the s'more

106
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,548
people around you except that we're

107
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,780
really not that big either if you have

108
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,310
the time to get on the phone and rat out

109
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,169
your neighbor so if you're not busy

110
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,000
enough on your job and you have time to

111
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:44,589
snitch you might want to go back to

112
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,969
working on your job and find what you're

113
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,769
missing profit is because your neighbors

114
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:49,769
not stealing it cool thanks

115
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,310
it's terrible it's terrible I just have

116
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,689
a friend to make it let me up in a

117
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,920
neighbor ratted him out and you got a

118
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:01,979
misdemeanor charge for it

119
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,208
cuz he had excess plants but you know

120
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,619
saying it didn't have to happen no we

121
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,229
did not have to happen this is just this

122
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,120
is hate and discontent and it's not

123
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:10,919
necessary and it's people saying I think

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
because they're encouraging the hotlines

125
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,208
they have the hotlines where you can

126
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,579
call and they know no repercussions if

127
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,189
it's a bad tip it's just that's such a

128
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,209
police state yes yeah it's just not it's

129
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:26,219
just not a good way to cultivate

130
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,540
relationships with people and I don't

131
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,800
ever agree with it because fundamentally

132
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,560
people are trying to support their

133
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,540
children just like you and if you're if

134
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,579
you were snitching to me is if your

135
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,950
neighbor is kidnapping children and

136
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,870
women and putting them in the basement

137
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,879
that's not snitching that's that's

138
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,500
community service because they're gonna

139
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,969
get your children next they're gonna get

140
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,410
your neighbors children next though that

141
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,490
might be your wife in the basement

142
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,130
that's different that's just called

143
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,639
protecting yourself from sociopaths in

144
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:57,060
life community's always did that but not

145
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,099
when someone's working on something and

146
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,050
you're like I'm I had to do all this cuz

147
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,050
it's anger it's an anger driven I had to

148
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,460
do all this and how dare you not and I

149
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,160
want to punish you because I feel

150
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,680
punished and to me that is just your

151
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,020
your re already not even in cannabis

152
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,030
anymore you're so far off of the

153
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,439
cannabis concept it's not fun guys will

154
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:18,029
be selling anything you could eat you

155
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,620
and not in cannabis doing commoditize

156
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,379
business and so to me once you do that

157
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,600
you know long

158
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,399
the world on from and but the problem is

159
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,650
though they're definitely here and they

160
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,649
are definitely using the phones
