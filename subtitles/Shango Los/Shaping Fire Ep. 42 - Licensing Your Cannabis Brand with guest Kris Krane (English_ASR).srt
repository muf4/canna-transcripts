2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:11,699
it was late 2015 when I first watched

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,099
overly excited and inexperienced new

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,528
cannabis executives totally fail at

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,570
Interstate brand licensing they were an

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:20,698
Oregon company seeking to expand their

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,560
brand into Washington I was the lead

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,810
negotiator on the Washington side of the

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,368
deal the deal as it appeared on paper

10
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,159
was really more of a franchise agreement

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,259
than it was a brand licensing deal and I

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,700
saw it as packed with red flags it

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,520
included some attributes that were

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,170
downright fraud to get around the state

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,790
ownership laws here in Washington and

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,859
then another part of the deal would have

17
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,089
cost my clients their license because of

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,070
how they were intending to move the

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,109
money around now these were not bad

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,700
people these were folks who just didn't

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,009
know enough about business to do it the

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,109
right way and they were very driven to

23
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:55,140
find a creative solution in the morass

24
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,789
of regulation luckily for us another

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,350
cannabis business was publicly

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,230
reprimanded for trying to set up the

27
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,239
same kind of licensing deal our suitors

28
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,908
wanted to set up with us and everyone

29
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,039
realized that my cautious read of the

30
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,680
situation was spot on and everybody

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,200
involved walked away from that deal this

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,700
is wildly common some of the stories

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,829
I've heard from California and Nevada

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,250
recently have similar blatantly

35
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,390
fraudulent and unenforceable traits

36
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,739
today's show is intended to give you

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,439
context on the differences between

38
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,239
licensing and franchising how to choose

39
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,339
partners and how to think correctly

40
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,739

we're gonna talk about Interstate brand

88
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,649
licensing I also want to note that we

89
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,780
experienced some technical difficulties

90
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,280
while recording this episode while Chris

91
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,080
and I were both in professional studios

92
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,120
we were still talking via the internet

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,890
and some days packets just don't travel

94
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,390
well you'll hear some pops during the

95
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,979
first set but they do settle down as the

96
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,809
show goes on and eventually kind of go

97
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,548
away so it'll be alright and we

98
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,370
appreciate you hanging with us welcome

99
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,560
to the show Chris hey thanks for having

100
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,000
me right on so let's get it let's start

101
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,379
by getting everybody on the same page

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,030
right cuz everybody thinks they've got

103
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,979
an idea about what's going on with

104
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,500
licensing and franchising and and

105
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,399
everyone's expansion to other states but

106
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,409
for a lot of people they don't

107
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,739
necessarily understand why this is such

108
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:43,530
a pressing thing so certainly we're

109
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,379
seeing some brands break out as clear

110
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,479
leaders in their origination state the

111
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,519
state that they are from that they built

112
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,409
their first business in but most of

113
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,170
these companies are eyeing expansion

114
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:57,719
into other states to explain this to

115
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,909
folks would you explain why expansion

116
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,319
beyond one state is so attractive to

117
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:03,419
these companies and perhaps even

118
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,299
necessary in the cannabis market that

119
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,578
we're looking at right now yeah I mean I

120
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,930
think like any business you you're gonna

121
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:11,790
want to expand your business one

122
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,140
successful so if your operational one

123
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,419
state and you're doing well in one state

124
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,009
you're gonna want to expand elsewhere I

125
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,228
think that the big difference between

126
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,750
the cannabis industry and other

127
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:24,779
businesses is that you know if you're

128
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,668
successful in in a state let's choose

129
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,239
microbrews for example let's say you set

130
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:28,918
up a success

131
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,430
microbrewery in colorado you gain good

132
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,589
market share Colorado you start seeing

133
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,538
some popularity you know online for your

134
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:40,409
products in some neighboring states say

135
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:42,060
California and Arizona you want to start

136
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,039
expanding to those states you would

137
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,478
simply increase your production capacity

138
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:47,969
at your called your ball your

139
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:50,098
cultivation in this case your your your

140
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,919
brewing facility in Colorado and you

141
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:55,439
would start shipping product into

142
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,818
California and Arizona that's simply not

143
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,098
possible in the cannabis industry

144
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,810
because it's still federally illegal and

145
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:03,060
because of its state-by-state nature of

146
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,918
the industry so if you have a product

147
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,319
that's gaining popularity and you want

148
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,149
to expand your market share expand your

149
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,009
market you have to go to another state

150
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:13,829
and you have to get another license in

151
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,710
that other state which may not be the

152
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:18,810
easiest thing in the world to do in most

153
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:20,788
states they have very competitive

154
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,199
application processes where you're gonna

155
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,579
be competing against lots of other

156
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,090
operators from around the country as

157
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,829
well as some homegrown folks and you

158
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:30,209
know and a lot of those states there

159
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,529
just aren't licenses available many

160
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,689
states have a limit on the number of

161
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,939
licenses they grant all of those at once

162
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,439
and then they're not able beyond that it

163
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,839
so the only way to get into those other

164
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,968
states would be either to acquire a

165
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,959
license in another state to basically

166
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:48,899
buy somebody else's business or to

167
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,000
license your brand to a license holder

168
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,098
in another state so say you have a brand

169
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,839
somebody wins a production license in a

170
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:56,848
different state you want to get in there

171
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,068
there's no brands if there's no licenses

172
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:01,228
available you don't have the capital or

173
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,270
don't want to buy that license you could

174
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,829
find willing partner in another state

175
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,180
and license that brand to them so

176
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:10,139
essentially licensing your intellectual

177
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:13,079
property your your SOPs your way of your

178
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,218
methods of production and your brand and

179
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,109
it would then start producing and

180
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:17,939
selling your brand and use some sort of

181
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,030
licensing fee or royalty agreement back

182
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,379
you back to the main company one other

183
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,728
thing I would just want to point out in

184
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,709
terms of why people are looking to do

185
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:27,449
this is you know this is a this is a

186
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,038
growing industry and it's very hard to

187
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,689
be a successful business just operating

188
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,129
in one state and so it makes sense you

189
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,779
would want to go state to state to state

190
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,088
and when we look at what's happening for

191
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,978
example in the public markets where in

192
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:39,629
Canada a lot of these US companies are

193
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,968
going getting listed there's a big

194
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,949
appetite for

195
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:44,389
multi-state operators there's much less

196
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,369
of an appetite in terms of getting

197
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:47,899
publicly listed in getting investment

198
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:49,459
into your company if you're a single

199
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:51,019
state operator and so that's also been a

200
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,179
big motivation I think over the last

201
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:54,199
year for folks to get into multiple

202
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:57,048
states because it provides them with

203
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,149
better access to capital which in a

204
00:06:57,048 --> 00:07:00,709
federally illegal industry with no

205
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:03,949
access to traditional institutional

206
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:05,569
lending is particularly attractive yeah

207
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,788
I think you're right the big role that

208
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:09,799
access to capital plays because you know

209
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:11,329
in the in the earlier some five to five

210
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:13,818
years ago there are a lot of folks who

211
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:15,739
were planning on on doing it on their

212
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:16,879
own right and then they realized that

213
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:19,968
the only way they were going to get

214
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,699
access to capital is from people who

215
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:24,918
wanted them to hit a grand slam so it

216
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,079
was no longer really people just doing a

217
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,838
solid job in their state of origination

218
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,929
suddenly if people wanted to you know

219
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:34,418
get get capital they needed to have as

220
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:37,308
part of their pitch with their national

221
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:39,859
expansion was so-so in it along that

222
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:42,949
thought Chris you know do you think that

223
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,439
there's going to be much future for

224
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:47,778
companies that choose to stay in one

225
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:51,289
state and don't expand into other states

226
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:52,819
I think there will be yeah but I think

227
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:55,188
it's gonna get it's gonna get

228
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,169
progressively harder to do that so I

229
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:59,449
think the O's that will you know survive

230
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:02,269
as a solo state operator are largely

231
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:06,769
going to be you know those folks who

232
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:09,559
have a really solid sort of craft brand

233
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:12,019
in particular you know I think there's a

234
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:14,269
there's a place for craft production so

235
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:17,028
you know the highest quality flour the

236
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:18,439
highest quality products where you know

237
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:19,879
you you have you would have a hard time

238
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,699
doing that as a much larger scale

239
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,289
operator I think those folks will you

240
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,848
know will find a way survive and

241
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:27,528
ultimately you know the the walls of

242
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:30,139
Interstate Commerce are going to come

243
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:31,968
down on and when that happens they'll be

244
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,250
an ability for some of those those

245
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:35,418
single state operators to expand all of

246
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,188
a sudden your state doesn't really

247
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:38,299
matter as much you know if you're

248
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:40,038
getting if you're getting orders from

249
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,508
your just across the border which you

250
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:43,539
know some of these Northeast states

251
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,379
might be you know a 45-minute drive away

252
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,269
you know that's no longer a relevant

253
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:49,308
factor you can sell into another state

254
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,678
once multi-state car interstate commerce

255
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:54,740
opens up and I think to the the other

256
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:57,259
potential Avenue for for the solo op

257
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,860
and we're starting to see this now is

258
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:02,659
frankly is to be acquired themselves so

259
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,389
they you know if you can bill really

260
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:08,329
solid brand in one state whether it's a

261
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:11,509
prop brand or as a great cultivator or

262
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,009
the great retail brand as some of these

263
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,110
you know larger multi-state

264
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:17,929
consolidators and multi-state operators

265
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,028
to start looking to acquire assets and

266
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,669
and grow their their license portfolio

267
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:24,639
those who have done a really nice job of

268
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:27,949
operating a single store or a single

269
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,838
operation within one state are going to

270
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,778
be you know nice attractive targets to

271
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,880
these multi-state consolidators so you

272
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:37,730
know as you know as we all know you only

273
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,320
really need to worry about this you know

274
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,269
the difficulty in spanning to another

275
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,370
state if you're actually a license

276
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,519
holder in your particular state you know

277
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:48,799
corollary companies like making bonds or

278
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,179
being a tax accountant firm or all these

279
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,829
are the things that that you don't have

280
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:53,659
to hold a license for you all's can just

281
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,180
expand like you traditionally would off

282
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:58,100
you go but if it's folks who I actually

283
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,039
have got a state license where you are

284
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,278
either a producer of the flower you know

285
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,919
a processor of it in some way transport

286
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,570
or a retailer and what I'm curious is

287
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:13,519
from your experience are you finding

288
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:16,820
that particular niches of that that set

289
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,578
of market is finding an easier time of

290
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:23,120
expanding than others

291
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:25,429
you know not really frankly it it

292
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
depends on the state because new states

293
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:29,838
have very different caps on the number

294
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,070
of licenses and ways to expand so for

295
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,670
example you know to get a cultivation

296
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:36,200
license in Nevada is fairly easy or was

297
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,759
very easy in the application process and

298
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,009
would be relatively easy to acquire

299
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,259
because they granted 180 cultivation

300
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:46,220
licenses for a state of about 4 million

301
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:49,129
people compared to say in Illinois where

302
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,320
there are 19 cultivation / production

303
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:54,078
licenses for a state of 13 million

304
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,660
people you know those licenses much much

305
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,979
more difficult to acquire or to even win

306
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:00,889
in the first place

307
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,509
so it has less to do with which part of

308
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:05,028
the vertical urine right cultivation

309
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:07,009
production dispensary as opposed to what

310
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:08,600
states are looking to expand into what

311
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,379
the availability of licenses

312
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,610
are in those states either from a from a

313
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,500
Lexus application standpoint or an

314
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,879
acquisition standpoint all right so like

315
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,980
a guy like you who is working in in many

316
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,439
of the states for your own group

317
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,269
forefront ventures and are also probably

318
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,250
assisting some other people in other

319
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,159
states where forefront ventures is not

320
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,589
working themselves where have you seen

321
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:36,289
to be the hardest states to move into so

322
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,060
far and for what reason

323
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,500
well they've mostly been states in the

324
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,268
eastern half of the US and that's

325
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,068
primarily it's a combination of factors

326
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,679
but number one is the is the limit on

327
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:46,789
the number of licenses so in a lot of

328
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,828
these states in the eastern half of the

329
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:52,129
country there's a really small number of

330
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:54,979
overall licenses so the applications for

331
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:57,708
these licenses are incredibly

332
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,970
competitive and you even if you put

333
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,739
together you know in some states I would

334
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,259
say if you put together in an A+ team

335
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,839
with an A+ quality application and like

336
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:08,568
an A+ lobbying effort you might have a

337
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,009
10 to 15 percent chance of winning you

338
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:11,419
know if you if you if you can't put all

339
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,919
that together you may have not you may

340
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:15,500
as well not even bother applying I would

341
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,208
look at states like Florida New York for

342
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,980
example states that fit that New Jersey

343
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:21,078
some has been similar although we think

344
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,730
New Jersey's about to open up to more

345
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:24,258
licenses later on this year and into

346
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,600
next year as they expand their medical

347
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:29,000
program and Spanish recreational you

348
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,310
know even a state like Illinois where

349
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,528
there's again there's 13 or sorry

350
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,539
there's 13 million people and 19

351
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:37,250
cultivator producer licenses right

352
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:39,860
that's a very difficult state to get

353
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,230
into so by and large it's the states in

354
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,028
the northeast during the eastern half of

355
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,120
the country with the limited licenses

356
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:49,938
very challenging application processes

357
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,078
and fairly strict regulatory environment

358
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:52,639
so you know not only do you have to be

359
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,758
able to win a license or acquire a

360
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,220
license you have to be able to navigate

361
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,050
what's generally stricter regulatory

362
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,269
environments than you then you get in

363
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:05,088
many of the western states so clearly

364
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:07,698
there are savvy business people in every

365
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:10,850
state but as we've seen you know there's

366
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:13,250
a certain amount of I don't know

367
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,829
corporate memory creep of how to do

368
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,558
Canada's business specifically that

369
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:20,750
comes along with normalization and that

370
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:21,698
has generally been you know coming from

371
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,828
the west coast

372
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:25,988
across the country as more states first

373
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:31,138
adopt medical and then move their way

374
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:31,139
towards rec do you find that there is

375
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,449
that then along with setting up these

376
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:40,119
licensing arrangements going east that

377
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:42,639
there's not only a lot of just you know

378
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:45,009
simple negotiating the licenses but

379
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,438
there's bringing these these otherwise

380
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:50,379
competent entrepreneurs up to speed

381
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:52,328
going east just so they understand the

382
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:59,619
the new moving parts in this industry

383
00:13:52,328 --> 00:14:03,358
that hasn't existed before can you I'm

384
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:03,359
sorry can you repeat the question there

385
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:12,159
the point I'm trying to bring out here

386
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:13,928
is that that that there are good

387
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,659
business people everywhere right but

388
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:19,688
they may not necessarily know cannabis

389
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:22,868
business specifically in every state are

390
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:25,480
you finding that as as as cannabis is

391
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:26,949
moving into these new states that yeah

392
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,350
you need to reach out you need to find

393
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:31,328
partners you need to to negotiate what

394
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,069
you want to do with the license but at

395
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,899
the same time you also have to teach

396
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:36,928
cannabis business because it's different

397
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:40,178
and unique to other types of business

398
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:42,159
yeah I think that's right when you look

399
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:44,048
at some of the more successful operators

400
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,399
in particularly in these more

401
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:46,778
challenging states what you typically

402
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,129
see and I would say successful in terms

403
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:50,528
of both winning the license and then

404
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:54,369
operating licenses what you typically

405
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:57,428
see is a combination of your business

406
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:59,168
experience and cannabis experience and

407
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:00,639
frankly you know local political

408
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:02,109
experience as well I mean these these

409
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,239
licenses are somewhat political in terms

410
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,639
of how they're granted even if states

411
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:08,850
like to say they're not so you know and

412
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,649
they tend to give to friends to locals

413
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:15,308
to a degree as well sometimes implicitly

414
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:17,379
sometimes explicit so you know that it's

415
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:18,448
the combination of having a really good

416
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,308
local Oh

417
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:22,688
good local business people who might

418
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:25,208
have good political connections or good

419
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,259
real estate connections who partner up

420
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,149
with folks who have really good

421
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,678
experience from outside of that state

422
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,078
that can help demonstrate competency in

423
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:35,439
cannabis and that that combination tends

424
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,149
to do fairly well it is a bit harder

425
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,100
or the business people who've never done

426
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:40,990
in cannabis to figure out how to do this

427
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,300
on their own without you know a

428
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:46,299
significant dose of education and of his

429
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:49,179
business and likewise I think for folks

430
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:51,159
who started in cannabis particularly in

431
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:53,138
you know the more sort of great markets

432
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,149
in California in prior to the last year

433
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:57,370
or so when real regulations came into

434
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:58,990
place a lot of those folks had a really

435
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,480
hard time navigating these much more

436
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,528
complex regulatory environments in the

437
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,089
eastern half of the country so I think

438
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,669
that combination is proven to be

439
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:08,829
relatively successful and frankly fairly

440
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:10,419
necessary for both sides of the equation

441
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:12,159
right on that makes a lot of sense

442
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,899
so we're gonna take our first short

443
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,600
break a little early and try to get rid

444
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:18,458
of that pop in the recording so so blah

445
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,290
stay with us you are listening to

446
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:23,099
shaping fire and my guest today is Chris

447
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:26,078
Crane co-founder of forefront ventures

448
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,600
as a business owner you are incredibly

449
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,609
busy in reality you are responsible for

450
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,740
everything your company does you've got

451
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,240
so many responsibilities every single

452
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,339
day that often you just don't have the

453
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,620
time to really dig into your marketing

454
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:40,149
as deeply as you'd like you know there's

455
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,039
more that you could do to reach out to

456
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,750
new customers and encourage loyalty and

457
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,309
the customers you do have but you

458
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,078
certainly don't have the time for it and

459
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:49,838
you're not really ready to hire someone

460
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,599
full-time for that role either for you I

461
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,699
recommend blunt branding at blunt

462
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,069
branding Kirsten Nelson and her team are

463
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:58,929
focused on improving your bottom line

464
00:16:57,068 --> 00:17:01,269
you know most marketing firms are

465
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:03,309
excited to make your logo packaging and

466
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,169
website very pretty but they leave

467
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:07,328
responsibility for improving your bottom

468
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,309
line up to you they don't want that kind

469
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:10,959
of responsibility but that's pretty much

470
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:13,689
the most important part of marketing

471
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,089
right Kirsten and her team will help you

472
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,740
engage new customers funnel them to your

473
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:20,198
point of sale whether it be online or

474
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,019
storefront and keep them coming back to

475
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,000
you and telling their friends now if you

476
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,769
happen to be a new cannabis company or

477
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,720
an established company moving from

478
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:31,509
medical to adult use in your state

479
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,490
Kirsten especially can help you not only

480
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:36,038
is she well-versed in marketing and

481
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,529
finance but she totally gets cannabis

482
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:40,658
whole plant medicine terpenes heritage

483
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:43,058
farmers and the particular needs of

484
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:45,490
startups check out what she did recently

485
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:46,160
for moon time medicinals in Humboldt

486
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,789
County

487
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,200
at moon time medicinals calm Kirsten and

488
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:53,180
her team put together a whole brand

489
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,670
package for them built their website and

490
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,740
wrote their sales materials no doubt

491
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,910
this is a paid commercial spot but that

492
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,160
does not mean that they bought my

493
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,930
opinion I've worked with blunt branding

494
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,940
on four projects now for various clients

495
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,710
and every single time they have done

496
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,019
more than they've promised and over

497
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,269
delivered on results I love how they

498
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:13,369

548
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,980
and our guest this week is Chris Crane

549
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:03,599
founder of forefront ventures so during

550
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,048
the first set we talked a lot about why

551
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,539
a company would be looking to expand

552
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:11,548
beyond their origination state for all

553
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,889
sorts of good reasons from spreading the

554
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:17,009
risk around to accessing more capital

555
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,559
and also just to be able to be an

556
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:22,950
established national brand but one of

557
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,139
the things that gets people in a bad

558
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,600
position constantly is a confusion

559
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,620
between licensing and franchising and

560
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,079
that's what we're gonna talk about

561
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:32,849
primarily today here in the second set

562
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:36,089
so Chris you know now that we've

563
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:37,439
established the why let's focus on the

564
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:40,230
heart and that's the difference between

565
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,419
licensing and franchising people often

566
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,370
Lee mistakenly think that they're

567
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,370
synonymous but they are certainly not

568
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,599
and they're really not even

569
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:51,539
interchangeable for cannabis what's the

570
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:54,839
primary differences between licensing

571
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,909
and franchising sure so it's a good

572
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,639
question and you're right people really

573
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,779
do often get this one wrong and they use

574
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,640
the words interchangeably but they're

575
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,349
quite different you know the main thing

576
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,809
to get across is I don't think there is

577
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:07,769
any franchising in cannabis right now I

578
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,700
know there are some groups that have

579
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:10,129
looked at doing it but I don't think

580
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,039
anybody's actually running at a

581
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:16,500
traditional franchise the two to back up

582
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,230
the main difference between licensing

583
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,029
and franchising is licensing is

584
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:25,110
essentially you are giving somebody the

585
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:26,819
right to use your brand and potentially

586
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:29,819
your intellectual property some

587
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:32,460
operating protocols your methods of

588
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:34,470
production and then they have the right

589
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,298
to use that and they pay you some fee to

590
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:43,440
do that franchising agreements are much

591
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:46,048
more broad so they give you the ability

592
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,519
to to essentially sell all of those

593
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:51,240
things write your name of your your

594
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:54,269
brand and your your SOPs your protocols

595
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:58,470
write your methodology but you also have

596
00:21:54,269 --> 00:22:01,379
a much greater degree of control over

597
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:04,429
your franchisee so in a franchise

598
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,620
agreement you can tell your franchisor

599
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,720
you must offer these sales on these days

600
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,609
your store must look exactly this way

601
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,308
you must buy your products from these

602
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:15,949
vendors or you must buy these products

603
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:17,869
from us specifically franchisor can tell

604
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,190
you where you can locate and where you

605
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,678
can't locate in fact they can tell you

606
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,320
where you have to locate so if you go

607
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,360
and buy a Dunkin Donuts for example you

608
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,069
have no freedom over what that Dunkin

609
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:29,928
Donuts looks like over where you buy

610
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:32,720
your products over where you buy your

611
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:34,759
doughnut making materials and and what

612
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,740
not or is in a licensing agreement it's

613
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,339
very difficult to get into that level of

614
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:44,859
detail and so licensees have a bit more

615
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:47,898
freedom than a franchisee would have

616
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:50,288
license sores also have to jump through

617
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:52,518
sniffing utley fewer hoops than

618
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:55,099
franchisors would have to go through so

619
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,269
in order to be a franchisor you have to

620
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:58,969
put you come up with what's called a

621
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:01,118
franchise disclosure agreement or

622
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,679
franchise disclosure document and FDD

623
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:07,220
that there are very specific guidelines

624
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:11,090
that govern what what go into an FDD

625
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,069
there's a ton of disclosures about the

626
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,628
owners of the company any business that

627
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:16,609
you've done anybody that you've offered

628
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:18,949
franchises to I mean it's a it's it's a

629
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:20,058
few hundred pages of background

630
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,990
information information about the

631
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:23,868
business

632
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,308
there are rules around how you how you

633
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,658
franchise so you have to give that

634
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:28,249
document to somebody you then can't

635
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:30,110
contact them for something like a week

636
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:32,360
let's make sure they have time to review

637
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:34,519
it right if you do then they can get out

638
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:35,898
of their franchise agreement and so it's

639
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,159
a it's a real process and then in about

640
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:39,319
half the states are over half the states

641
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,090
you have to file with the state court or

642
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:43,730
franchise board to be recognized as a

643
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:45,048
franchisor in that state in order to

644
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,999
offer a franchise none of those are

645
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,918
necessary for licensing agreements a

646
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:50,329
licensing agreement you know any good

647
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,129
corporate attorney can put together a

648
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:53,808
license agreement for you you negotiate

649
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:56,569
that with the attorney on the other side

650
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:58,069
you all agree to what parameters you're

651
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,109
going to operate under but you won't as

652
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:02,210
the license or have the same degree of

653
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:04,428
control over your licensee that you

654
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,740
would as a franchisee work over their

655
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:09,649
franchisee let's tease out where that

656
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:12,829
threshold is right because while while

657
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:15,528
in a licensed relationship you can't

658
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:18,288
call out everything as specifically as

659
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:19,878
in a franchise relationship certainly

660
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:22,669
there are some things that you can

661
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:25,279
control for example I would think the

662
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:27,350
the deployment of the brand and what the

663
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,690
looks like essentially the the brand

664
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:31,429
usage book that probably stays

665
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,640
consistent since that's part of what's

666
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,560
being licensed that's right but but

667
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,920
where does that where does that end so

668
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,839
does it does it end as soon as you start

669
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,210
talking about the operations of the

670
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,209
company or is it only particular parts

671
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:50,329
of the operation so there's not really a

672
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,160
clear line and this is where I mean I

673
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:53,689
should I should disclaim all this by

674
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,670
saying I'm not an attorney and today

675
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,309
thinking about if you're really thinking

676
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,440
about your becoming a franchisor or a

677
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:03,200
licensed or or a franchisee or licensee

678
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,670
you need to seek out a good corporate

679
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,990
attorney and if you're on the franchisee

680
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,880
side of things definitely seek out a

681
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,829
franchise attorney or specific attorneys

682
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,410
that handle these kind of things and I'm

683
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:13,849
not one of those so we'll talk about

684
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,800
this at the high level but my

685
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:18,259
understanding is there's not a very it's

686
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,609
not a concrete line between what you

687
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:22,099
know what would constitute a franchisee

688
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:24,139
versus a license but generally you're

689
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:25,639
right it's things like you can say you

690
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,320
have the right to use the brand the

691
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,220
brand has to say consistent right you

692
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:32,089
can't just change the logo or or do

693
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,089
something that's going to be detrimental

694
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:36,439
to that to 2d2 the overall brand and

695
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:37,730
you'd have to set out certain guidelines

696
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,809
as to you know this is what we expect

697
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,710
out of the brand this is what it looks

698
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:44,929
and feels like you you can and you can

699
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,900
you can't dictate how they run their

700
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:50,750
business so again you can't say in a

701
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,120
licensing agreement you have to buy all

702
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,920
of your products from me right you have

703
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,389
to you have to buy these products from

704
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,519
these vendors and you have to buy this

705
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,560
particular type of floor board for your

706
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,859
store this particular type of display

707
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,440
case for your store you can you can do a

708
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:08,659
little bit of that as long as as long as

709
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,690
what you're what you're contracting

710
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:15,769
around is to protect the integrity of

711
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:18,380
the brand but you can't tell them they

712
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:20,329
have to do this they have to do that the

713
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,590
fees are also to also tend to be a

714
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,549
little bit different in a licensing

715
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:24,829
agreement you can have all different

716
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:27,079
kinds of fees so somebody could pay you

717
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:28,759
you know a flat fee per month to license

718
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:32,210
your brand and your in your operations

719
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,099
protocols it could pay you a royalty on

720
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,870
sales there's a lot of different ways to

721
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,678
do it with a franchise agreement it's

722
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:38,929
much more standard

723
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:42,410
you typically pay a

724
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,180
upfront fee as your upfront franchise

725
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:48,110
fee and then there's an ongoing percent

726
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,580
sales back to the franchisor some which

727
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:51,469
your ongoing franchise fees some which

728
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:53,750
are joint marketing fees and so usually

729
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,850
the franchisor will do marketing for you

730
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,529
all of their franchises in in an area so

731
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:00,619
for example again if you go back to what

732
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:02,660
Dunkin Donuts having lived in Boston for

733
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,639
the last four years it's a good one to

734
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,200
use for me since you can't throw a rock

735
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,110
without hitting a Dunkin Donuts and the

736
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,309
Boston area but you know there's so

737
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:12,019
there's a there's there's hundreds of

738
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:13,909
Dunkin Donuts in the Boston area for

739
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:17,299
example they don't each go out and do

740
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,710
their own advertising the corporate

741
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:20,089
retinue the corporate franchise or

742
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,240
Dunkin Donuts does all of the

743
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:25,369
advertising for all franchises in Boston

744
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,029
so they'll run the advertising on Boston

745
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:31,039
radio on Boston TV on you know online

746
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:32,509
and and and that's to the benefit of the

747
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,369
choices they don't have to then go out

748
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:35,960
and spend that money themselves but it's

749
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,459
also why it's important for the

750
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,890
franchisor to make sure that if somebody

751
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,029
walks into you know one Dunkin donut so

752
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,100
then they walk into another Dunkin

753
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:44,750
Donuts your half mile down the road that

754
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,369
all of the products are the same the

755
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,779
displays are the same the look and feel

756
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:50,269
is the same right it's the exact same

757
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,950
experience that's much harder to dictate

758
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:53,480
through a licensing agreement than it is

759
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,130
through a franchising agreement all

760
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,599
right that makes sense so let's dig a

761
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,430
little deeper into that because I

762
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:01,309
thought I had an idea of what the

763
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,900
threshold was and then and then and then

764
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:04,579
I realize I don't because I thought that

765
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,420
we were gonna say that

766
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:11,240
the the threshold for a license is that

767
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,950
your licensing the brand and that when

768
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,160
you're doing a franchise relationship

769
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,380
it's it's more operational based and the

770
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,080
how-to but I and this last answer you

771
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,680
said that the licensees will license

772
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,929
both the brand and the SOPs the standard

773
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,779
operating procedures how how the the

774
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:31,850
company can run internally so so this

775
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:35,000
tell this suggests to me that perhaps

776
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:37,639
the threshold between a franchise and a

777
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,279
license may be perhaps on the

778
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,900
enforcement of this of the operating

779
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,480
procedures because from my understanding

780
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,780
with a franchise they can send people

781
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:52,519
from the home office to the franchised

782
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:54,440
location and run them through a bunch of

783
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,329
of questions to make sure that

784
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,840
everything is running as it's supposed

785
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:02,269
to in the operating procedures from the

786
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,939
home office and I and and and I believe

787
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:07,250
that with licensees that actually breaks

788
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,470
the law and you can't actually and do

789
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:12,230
that that kind of enforcement so so we

790
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,700
hit that a little bit if you would yeah

791
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,079
my understanding is that that's right

792
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,569
and again this is where the liens give

793
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,889
it a little bit blurry but it's which

794
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,720
what is clear is as a franchisor

795
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,980
absolutely you can send folks from Home

796
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,450
Office in so you look if you're not

797
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,500
doing all this we have the right and we

798
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,600
have the right to take your store away

799
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,549
and take another franchise or from

800
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,209
another store and give it to them you

801
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,769
know if you're not if you're not

802
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:33,558
maintaining the integrity of our of our

803
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,759
brand in our stores that that not the

804
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:35,839
case with a licensing agreement or

805
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,599
you're gonna have to go through a number

806
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,089
of steps to your not claim contract

807
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,740
infringement and then and there has to

808
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:45,199
be steps to remedy that infringement

809
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,630
within the contract that you would you

810
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,890
would take as a French as a license or

811
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,260
towards your licensee give them the

812
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,030
opportunity to cure that so you're

813
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,230
dealing much will sort of standard

814
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:55,759
contract law rather than what you

815
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,140
haven't a franchisor and a franchise

816
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,690
agreement where the franchisor is have a

817
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,030
great deal of power but you're right the

818
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,850
licensing is not necessarily just around

819
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:06,980
a brand it is often around the operating

820
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:10,369
protocols specifically so you know let's

821
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:16,299
say for example somebody develops a

822
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:19,609
better way to create cannabis infused

823
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:22,099
patches right to a but kind of like a

824
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:24,709
whatever marries medicinals or Magana

825
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:27,349
molecular right who do that we do a you

826
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,700
know yeah the transdermal transdermal

827
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:29,808
exactly yeah trained several so let's

828
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,000
say somebody comes up with a really good

829
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:35,049
way to come up to do and thermal patches

830
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,589
and they have their own brand say in

831
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:40,970
Illinois right and then somebody from

832
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:42,740
Arkansas comes is I'd really like to use

833
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,140
that but you know what your brand in

834
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,880
Illinois isn't you know it's it's known

835
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,460
in Illinois but like nobody here in

836
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Arkansas knows your brand I don't put a

837
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,230
whole lot of value in the brand itself

838
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,160
because you know nobody knows it here

839
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,450
and I can put that out in the shelves

840
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,900
and they're not gonna know that from the

841
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:02,269
other transdermal patch but your

842
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,679
methodology is great and I really

843
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:04,940
interested in that and I want to build

844
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,540
my own brand around it

845
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,710
you could license the technology so

846
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,690
let's say you've created some kind of

847
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:15,019
machine that creates this transdermal

848
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,910
patch and then standard operating

849
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:18,289
procedures or standard operating

850
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,360
protocols for how you operate that

851
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:22,159
machinery you could license that machine

852
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:23,209
and those operating procedures but say

853
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,410
you know you can write you can just

854
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,900
white label it put your own brand on it

855
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,370
you don't have to run our you know you

856
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,660
don't have to have our brand but you

857
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:31,459
have to use the Machine you know you

858
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,960
were licensing you the ability to use

859
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,039
this machine so you don't own the

860
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,470
machine we own it

861
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:38,420
we're licensing you to use it and we're

862
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,950
licensing you the intellectual property

863
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,509
that goes along with how to operate it

864
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,069
but that would also fall under the

865
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:44,390
category of the licensing agreement so

866
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,970
it doesn't have to include demand

867
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,220
whereas with the franchisee it's

868
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,529
everything it's the brand it's the

869
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,870
operations it's the SOPs it's the look

870
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:56,599
and feel it's who you buy stuff from

871
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:58,009
it's how much you pay for it it's all of

872
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:59,689
it right so if you're if you're a if

873
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:01,670
you're a franchisor again we'll go back

874
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,230
to the Dunkin Donuts example you let's

875
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,870
say you won't you own a Dunkin Donuts

876
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:08,089
and you know some vendor hits you up and

877
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:10,279
it's like hey I can sell you the same

878
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:11,480
flour that you're buying from dunkey for

879
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:14,720
half the price and it's gonna you know

880
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,269
it's gonna save you you know ten cents

881
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,370
on every you know $0.50 doughnut that

882
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,690
you create or that your that you cook

883
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:22,279
you don't have the right to do that as a

884
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,600
franchisee or if you do that that's a

885
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,059
clear violation of your franchise

886
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,199
agreement and you could you could

887
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:28,970
potentially lose your store for that

888
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,170
that that kind of enforcement comes much

889
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,990
more difficult in a licensing agreement

890
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,880
right on so I've got one more question I

891
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,650
want to keep I want to keep banging at

892
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,810
this license versus franchising at the

893
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,640
threshold points so so you mentioned

894
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,589
that there's a gray area right and the

895
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,810
funny thing about gray area and business

896
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:47,389
people including myself is on one hand

897
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:49,250
you want to get rid of these gray areas

898
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,320
because these gray areas create risk

899
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,049
right and we're all trying to decrease

900
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:56,259
the amount of risk that surrounds our

901
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,659
business investment of time and capital

902
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:01,970
but at the same time I also know that as

903
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,250
a business person I've done most of my

904
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:07,670
best deals in the gray areas of

905
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:10,460
arbitrage kind of like you know finding

906
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:12,769
loopholes and and exploiting them to my

907
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,860
benefit so it's like a great you know

908
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:18,529
gray areas good or bad who is the

909
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:21,529
arbiter of the gray area

910
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:25,250
I'm guessing it's some some federal

911
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:26,990
group who when push came to shove if a

912
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:30,680
decision was to be made whether or not

913
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,319
something was licensed or franchise

914
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,840
there's got to be somebody who plays the

915
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:41,329
umpire to that so who does it eventually

916
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:43,669
fall to so it is there's if there is a

917
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:46,490
federal agency and and in off top my

918
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,690
head I'm not recalling the name of the

919
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,980
agency it's got federal offense

920
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,269
franchise form so there's a federal

921
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,339
agency that looks as it looked at this

922
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:55,220
Oda my understanding is this is actually

923
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:57,589
mostly done at the state level so most

924
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,480
states will license franchises through

925
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:03,199
their their their either their franchise

926
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,730
board or or corporate board and then

927
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,360
even states that don't you don't have to

928
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,889
register as a franchise or

929
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,418
they still have oversight over

930
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:13,519
franchisors because you still have to go

931
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:14,569
through the FDD disclosure process and

932
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,130
there's a long process you have to go

933
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,919
through in order to be a franchisor nor

934
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,940
sell franchises so you could get in

935
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:22,460
trouble at either the state or the

936
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,190
federal level and there's a there's

937
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,119
actually a no it's a category of law but

938
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,539
there's a there's a term called

939
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:31,940
accidental franchise which which which

940
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:34,009
is what gets people in trouble if they

941
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,990
are essentially acting as a franchisor

942
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:39,860
without having gone through the full

943
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:41,658
franchise process they can get fined as

944
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,370
an accidental franchisee their licensing

945
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,710
agreements can all be basically

946
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:47,539
nullified at that point they can get

947
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,300
massive fines they can lose a lot of

948
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:52,429
business so you know very important if

949
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,800
you're looking to get into licensing or

950
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:57,619
any kind of licensing agreement that you

951
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,150
consult with a good corporate attorney

952
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:00,230
or even a franchise attorney to make

953
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,480
sure you're not running afoul of

954
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,809
accidental franchise laws and that

955
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,070
generally comes down to the level of

956
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:08,000
control that you're giving your

957
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,980
licensees

958
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,210
so again if you're if you're just saying

959
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,340
look you have the right to use our brand

960
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:16,099
you don't have the right to do anything

961
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,230
that would besmirched our brand or bring

962
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,400
down our brand value and if you're going

963
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,809
to you know if you're looking for some

964
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,460
if you're trying to use our method ology

965
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:24,769
we really need you to stick to those

966
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,349
SOPs because you can gunk up our

967
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:29,599
machines if you don't do it this way

968
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:31,250
right all that's going to be fine but if

969
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,239
you start saying you have to buy certain

970
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,159
things from certain

971
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,599
people at certain times you have to do

972
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,420
things certain ways you have to offer

973
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,250
certain sales in certain days and we're

974
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,960
gonna do joint marketing for you and all

975
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,670
of our other licensees well now you're

976
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,199
starting to look like a franchisor and

977
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,970
that's the kinda stuff that get you in

978
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,929
trouble the other thing too is which a

979
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:49,219
lot because a lot of people don't

980
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:52,429
recognize the difference between

981
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:55,849
franchise and licensing is just don't

982
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:57,469
use the word franchise I've had a lot of

983
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:58,549
people who've had like oh yeah I've got

984
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:00,109
this great brand and we're gonna go and

985
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,280
we're gonna franchise the brand well

986
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,750
have you talked to a franchise attorney

987
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,310
about it well no well what do you plan

988
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,300
to do well we're gonna license this and

989
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:07,880
real essence that ok great

990
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,220
don't use the word franchise you are

991
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,329
licensed or you're not a franchisor like

992
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:12,589
that's like the number one thing they

993
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:14,630
get somebody in trouble for accidental

994
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:15,860
franchises they use the word franchise

995
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,510
because they just don't know the

996
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,250
difference and they don't get the

997
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,080
distinction so you really want to make

998
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,269
sure that you work with a good corporate

999
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,769
lawyer who really understands franchise

1000
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:26,090
law and accidental franchise so that

1001
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:28,400
your contracts are set up the right way

1002
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,650
your marketing materials are set up the

1003
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,610
right way your licensing agreements are

1004
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,410
set up the right way so you don't

1005
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,030
accidentally run afoul of these these

1006
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:37,279
quote-unquote accidental franchise laws

1007
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,869
right on now that we understand all of

1008
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,340
that we're gonna go to our second

1009
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:42,170
commercial break and we come back for

1010
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,358
set three we're gonna talk about how

1011
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,849
actually to implement one of these

1012
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:48,739
licensing agreements and some pitfalls

1013
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:49,849
to watch out for we're gonna take a

1014
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,500
short break and we'll be right back

1015
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:53,599
you're listening to shaping fire and my

1016
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,420
guest today is Chris Crane co-founder of

1017
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,279
forefront ventures as a listener of

1018
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,079
shaping fire you already understand the

1019
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,480
importance of living soil when growing

1020
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,549
cannabis when you have active microbe

1021
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,740
communities in your substrate you go way

1022
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,289
beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen

1023
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:10,939
phosphorus and potassium having active

1024
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:12,829
microorganisms in your substrate

1025
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,690
supports vigorous plant growth

1026
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:17,049
throughout the plants root zone making

1027
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,760
for higher yields and thriving flowers

1028
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,280
mammoth pee is the first organically

1029
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,720
derived microbial inoculant that focuses

1030
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,330
on your plants nutrient cycling

1031
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:28,069
processes to release soil phosphorus and

1032
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,380
other micronutrients from they're bound

1033
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,960
forms making them more available to the

1034
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,640
plant increased levels of phosphorous

1035
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,500
will also keep internode shorter and

1036
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,659
focus your plants energy on bud

1037
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,670
production not only that but the

1038
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:41,750
microbes act as a defense shield for the

plants rhizosphere

1040
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,519
by out competing potentially harmful

1041
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,290
pathogenic microbes

1042
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,630
pretty cool right mammoth he not only

1043
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:51,429
unlocks the nutrients in your soil but

1044
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:54,130
it also helps protect your plant from

1045
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:57,789
disease mammoth Peas beneficial bacteria

1046
00:37:54,130 --> 00:38:00,390
act like micro bio reactors continually

1047
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:02,559
producing enzymes that release nutrients

1048
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:04,599
mammoths Pia was developed at a u.s.

1049
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,579
university has been extensively tested

1050
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:08,980
by Colorado growers and independent

1051
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:12,069
laboratories mammoth pea is proven to

1052
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,539
increase growth and enhance blooming one

1053
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,340
of the great things about supplementing

1054
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:16,989
with microorganisms is that they won't

1055
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,539
compete with whatever fertilizer program

1056
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:21,369
you're already running simply dose on

1057
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:23,679
top of your fertilizer schedule for

1058

increased benefits to learn more and to

1059
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:29,369
find out where you can buy mammoth pee

1060
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,370
near you check out their website at

1061
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:43,569
www.att.com/biz industry people

1062
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:46,179
everywhere are looking for the purest

1063
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,710
terpenes without adulterants the problem

1064
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:49,299
with most terpene providers is that

1065
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,070
they're not sourced naturally and

1066
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,289
instead are made as a byproduct of

1067
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:56,050
refining petroleum and that's so sketchy

1068
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:58,059
the terpenes sold by true terpenes are

1069
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:01,000
entirely different they are certified

1070
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:02,619
organic non-gmo and food grade that

1071
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,050
means that they are extracted from real

1072
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:07,269
plant sources there are no solvents of

1073
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:10,210
any kind they are distilled only with

1074
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:12,639
steam that's right only steam in fact

1075
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,860
terpenes from true turbines are so pure

1076
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,659
that you can eat them not only that but

1077
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,099
you can stack them with better results -

1078
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:20,170
what I mean is

1079
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:22,299
other companies terpenes have got a few

1080
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,430
percent of impurities and when you stack

1081
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,200
those terpenes to make your blend you're

1082
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:29,019
adding a variety of impurities that

1083
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:31,210
degrade your final product true terpenes

1084
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:32,860
also have strain-specific terpenes for a

1085
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,409
wide range of cannabis strains like

1086

newsletter welcome back you're listening

1110
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:30,530
to shaping fire I'm your host Shango

1111
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,960
Lowe's and our guest this week is Chris

1112
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,820
Crane co-founder of forefront ventures

1113
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,590
so during the first set we talked about

1114
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,809
why folks are wanting to license and

1115
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:41,300
expand in other states and during set-to

1116
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:43,699
we really dug deeply into licensing and

1117
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,980
franchising so we got a really good idea

1118
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:48,230
of what it means to license your brand

1119
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:51,320
how to go about doing that and how to

1120
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:53,210
not get tripped up by agreements that

1121
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,180
are actually franchising which we cannot

1122
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:59,240
yet do it now in cannabis so with that I

1123
00:40:56,179 --> 00:41:02,539
now want to understand how we would

1124
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:05,179
reach out to parties in our new host

1125
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:07,849
target state if we want to expand so

1126
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:09,859
let's say that we are either in say for

1127
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:12,949
example Washington which is totally

1128
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,410
broke so a lot of the companies here are

1129
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:18,710
looking to expand into new states to

1130
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:20,809
hopefully have a greener future and then

1131
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,460
and then of course in California like

1132
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:24,469
everybody wants to expand nationally

1133
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,780
because everybody is aggressive as hell

1134
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:28,159
so so let's say that we have got our

1135
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,400
company and we're ready to move to

1136
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:34,460
another state Chris how do we find good

1137
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:38,240
reliable folks in the target state that

1138
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:39,889
we want to move into to work with so by

1139
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,959
and large there aren't that many license

1140
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:43,730
holders in most of these states rights

1141
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,099
in most states there are caps on the

1142
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,980
overall number of licenses and

1143
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:50,719
oftentimes the states list the winners

1144
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,550
so you can usually go on to the state's

1145
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,619
health department or a new department

1146
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,110
website and get a list of all the

1147
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:58,460
licensees in those states you can not

1148
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,890
often then go on to their corporate

1149
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,230
commission website and find their

1150
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:04,309
corporate foundation documents which I

1151
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,619
usually have some sort of contact

1152
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:08,119
information or you know oftentimes they

1153
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:09,059
may even have a website you can contact

1154
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,009
them that way

1155
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:14,369
so it's not that difficult by and large

1156
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,690
to find out who the licensees are in and

1157
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:18,450
by licensees I mean people who hold

1158
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:20,280
state licenses in these new states and

1159
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:21,868
those are gonna be your your targets to

1160
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,940
license your brand and you need to go to

1161
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:25,170
somebody who has a production license

1162
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,519
the cultivation license a dispensary

1163
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,519
Lysa's depending on what it is that

1164
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:30,659
you're looking to license so if you're

1165
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,670
not gonna go into one of these states

1166
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:35,219
and win a license yourself or acquire a

1167
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:37,950
license yourself it's not that difficult

1168
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,299
to find out who holds those state

1169
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:41,460
licenses and then figure out a way to

1170
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,130
reach out to them when you're vetting

1171
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,329
folks in the target state because let's

1172
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,090
say they're you know there could be a

1173
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:50,400
few hundred or more of these people that

1174
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:54,180
you're that you're targeting what do you

1175
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,599
look at as a first level vetting of who

1176
00:42:54,179 --> 00:43:00,779
you might want to go to first I think

1177
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,800
much like with just about anything you

1178
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,050
want it you want to feel comfortable

1179
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,460
with the management team so you want to

1180
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,440
find out you know who the owners are who

1181
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,059
the managers are you want to do some

1182
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,090
diligence on them there's background

1183
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:13,619
checks ask for references make sure you

1184
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,050
feel comfortable with the management

1185
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:17,760
team themselves and then and then it

1186
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,800
really depends on what it is you're

1187
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,210
looking to license so you know if you're

1188
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,619
a retailer for example and you're

1189
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,480
looking to license your retail brand

1190
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:26,130
you're gonna want to see you know where

1191
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,019
are they do they fit the you know do

1192
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,338
they fit the the types of areas that

1193
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:31,108
you'd like to locate your retail stores

1194
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:32,579
so if you're you know if you're the type

1195
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,049
of company that you know you want your

1196
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,519
stores on Main streets and high

1197
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,960
populated areas there you're probably

1198
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,269
aren't going to be as interested in

1199
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,608
somebody who has a more rural or

1200
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:46,829
suburban location you know if you are a

1201
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:50,400
product manufacturer you want to make

1202
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:54,539
sure that the the the license holder has

1203
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,588
a good operating capacity you know if

1204
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:57,269
you're a cultivator and you're trying to

1205
00:43:55,588 --> 00:43:58,889
learn since cultivation methodology

1206
00:43:57,269 --> 00:44:01,079
right - they have a good cultivation

1207
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:02,639
facility that would fit the types of

1208
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:04,529
operations per recalls that we're gonna

1209
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,629
be licensing or is this just a you know

1210
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:09,359
is this a bad fit from a you know from

1211
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:12,030
from a location standpoint you also want

1212
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,409
to think about distribution particularly

1213
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:16,320
when you're looking at larger states so

1214
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:18,389
in Illinois where I currently live there

1215
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,830
are a number of producers that are we

1216
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,868
call downstate right in the southern

1217
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:22,679
part of Illinois that's logistical

1218
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:24,390
challenging

1219
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:25,649
to get their products into the Chicago

1220
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:27,029
market on a regular basis because

1221
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,309
they're not allowed to warehouse their

1222
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,630
products in Chicago so anytime they want

1223
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:34,049
to make a shipment or they got a drive

1224
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:35,820
you know five six hours to you know to

1225
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,380
Chicago to drop things off and so you

1226
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,900
might want to look for somebody who has

1227
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:43,170
a cultivation or production facility

1228
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,809
that's closer to the the you know the

1229
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:47,550
the more dense markets or it's not going

1230
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:49,199
to be as difficult so all these will be

1231
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,700
factored in but it really does depend on

1232
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,710
you know what segment of the market

1233
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:55,379
you're looking at and what your ultimate

1234
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:58,289
goals are I can imagine that when

1235
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,119
setting up a licensing agreement that

1236
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:02,880
you know when going through the

1237
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,219
negotiation process and and putting

1238
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,880
numbers and compensation into the

1239
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:12,809
document it's probably relatively common

1240
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:16,500
for the licensee and the license or to

1241
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:20,519
have different perceived values of the

1242
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,530
brand where where the the the parent

1243
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,719
company thinks that their brand is worth

1244
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,180
so worth a whole hell of a lot and the

1245
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,099
licensee is all like man you're not in

1246
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:30,569
our state what have you seen about that

1247
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:33,900
where where they have got different

1248
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:36,150
values for the brand yeah that's been

1249
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,010
really interesting and and this

1250
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,650
something we saw play out a lot more a

1251
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:42,120
few years ago particularly these East

1252
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,579
Coast states were really just starting

1253
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,039
to come online knew you had brands like

1254
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:48,420
Dixie or o.penvape for example which at

1255
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,849
that time we're probably the two biggest

1256
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,860
brands on the west coast who had you

1257
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:55,529
know big market share in Colorado and

1258
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,120
California in particular and then people

1259
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:00,740
were winning licenses in places like

1260
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:04,409
Massachusetts or Illinois or Nevada

1261
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:05,789
Arizona and these companies were coming

1262
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:08,699
in and they were marketing themselves as

1263
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:11,369
the best brand in the industry household

1264
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:15,509
names and what we found was a disconnect

1265
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:17,819
between the the brand owners and the

1266
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,340
potential licensees in that the brand of

1267
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:22,710
owners often really valued the brand

1268
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,390
itself thinking like hey we've gotten

1269
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,440
all this market share in Colorado all

1270
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:26,879
this market share in California people

1271
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,490
love our brand or brands a household

1272
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,140
name right you the brand itself comes

1273
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:32,759
with a nice premium right you should pay

1274
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:34,259
up for the right to use that brand

1275
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,820
because it's such a good established

1276
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,630
brand and what a lot of the folks in

1277
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,269
these newer states

1278
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,369
looking at it's going well yeah people

1279
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:42,960
know Dixie in Colorado in California but

1280
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:44,609
if I were to go out and hold most

1281
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,980
cannabis consumers and most patients in

1282
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:48,599
in Illinois or Massachusetts or

1283
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,150
Connecticut most of them probably won't

1284
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,949
know what Dixie is so what I'm more

1285
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:56,760
interested in as the potential licensee

1286
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:58,500
is your operating protocols like I want

1287
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,780
to do marijuana infused beverages or I

1288
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,099
want to do vape pen cartridges but you

1289
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,960
know I don't really know how to do it

1290
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,099
and I know that that trying to do it on

1291
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,320
my own I'm gonna make a whole bunch of

1292
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:09,539
mistakes I'm gonna have to learn and

1293
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,190
that's gonna impact my you know my sales

1294
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:13,980
in the market I'm willing to pay a

1295
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,210
licensing agreement to use your SOPs and

1296
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,699
your operating protocols and your

1297
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,610
equipment and you know and and and not

1298
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:21,719
have to reinvent the wheel but you know

1299
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,760
I don't really care as much about

1300
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:25,649
whether my products are called Dixie or

1301
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,080
like right you know create something new

1302
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:29,610
on my own that's new to the market and

1303
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,230
it's actually I think why reason why a

1304
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,510
lot of those early licensing agreements

1305
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:35,460
didn't work is because there was a real

1306
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:37,980
disconnect over the value of the brand

1307
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:41,070
itself versus value of the operations

1308
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:43,019
protocols I would think to that that

1309
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:46,680
there would have to be some some really

1310
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:50,659
intense thinking by a brand who was

1311
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:53,429
being asked to license their SOPs

1312
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:57,289
without the brand right because

1313
00:47:53,429 --> 00:48:00,239
potentially they could be creating a a

1314
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:02,940
competitor in their own market who are

1315
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:06,119
making quality products just like them

1316
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,769
but then not using their name yeah I

1317
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:09,389
think that you know that that would be a

1318
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:10,710
real concern I think that's why a lot of

1319
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:12,000
these early agreements didn't get done

1320
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:13,230
now we're seeing more of them get done I

1321
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,380
think we've seen more movement on both

1322
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:18,599
sides towards towards consensus of what

1323
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,000
these brands are worth but you're right

1324
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:22,230
now by and large you're not so much

1325
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,400
concern that you're creating a

1326
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,170
competitor within your own market

1327
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,160
because by and large right with the with

1328
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,320
the nature of this being state-by-state

1329
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,089
you're going to markets where you're not

1330
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,950
already there and trying to license that

1331
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,840
technology and I said that brand but for

1332
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:35,129
the owners of the companies you're the

1333
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,720
value to them is really in the brand

1334
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,710
they want to get that brand out there so

1335
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:39,779
if you're a Dixie or you're an

1336
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,220
Incredibles or you're an opener you know

1337
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,620
one of these are wanna brands right you

1338
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:44,939
want to get that brand out there in

1339
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,960
these other states and your best way to

1340
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,000
do that is through a licensing agreement

1341
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,409
that gets challenging when the person

1342
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,219
the other side's going yeah I want you

1343
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:52,500
know I want

1344
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,059
I want the the expertise I want the

1345
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,519
protocols but I don't really care about

1346
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:58,049
your brand and I kind of want to develop

1347
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:59,789
my own brand and so you have to then you

1348
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:03,420
know stop and think is it is it worth it

1349
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:05,099
for me to help create a competitor even

1350
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,139
though reality is I'm getting I'm

1351
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:09,150
getting a cut of their sales right like

1352
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:10,980
the licensing agreements not free so if

1353
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:12,150
I create if I help create someone who

1354
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,800
becomes a really good competitor I'm

1355
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,539
still benefiting from it but I'm

1356
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,220
probably not benefiting in the way that

1357
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:19,050
I would if it were my brand that were

1358
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:20,879
being promoted because that then helps

1359
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:22,349
me expand that brand into other parts of

1360
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,690
the country it helps boost my brand port

1361
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:26,190
my brand profile may have boost my

1362
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,389
valuation is a company because I could

1363
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:30,119
point to my brand being all these

1364
00:49:27,389 --> 00:49:31,529
different states so it's a it's it's a

1365
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,340
real challenge and I could see from the

1366
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:36,960
standpoint of a license or why it might

1367
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,490
be on starter for many of them to just

1368
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,079
say I'm gonna let me know license get

1369
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:41,519
technology and you can do whatever brand

1370
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,858
you want with it now that in and of

1371
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,119
itself I think is a business model but

1372
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:47,429
if you're starting from the point of

1373
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,640
having a really well established brand

1374
00:49:47,429 --> 00:49:53,699
in a more in a more mature market you're

1375
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,650
probably going to want to make sure that

1376
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,210
that brand is being promulgated around

1377
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,369
the country and you're not just no

1378
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,990
seating competitors with the know-how

1379
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:03,450
you've learned through your years of

1380
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:05,250
trial and error one of the things that I

1381
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:06,899
talk with my clients about a lot is

1382
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,420
what's gonna happen to the market after

1383
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,930
Interstate Commerce is allowed because a

1384
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,730
lot of these you know not necessarily

1385
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:16,289
robust companies and individual states

1386
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,880
are just gonna get crushed from

1387
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:19,829
competitiveness primarily from

1388
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,990
California but you know there'll be

1389
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:24,179
artists and brands in individual states

1390
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:26,848
that stay you know strong and can hold

1391
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:29,819
off the onslaught from places where it's

1392
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:32,130
nicer to grow and maybe they've got more

1393
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,740
in-state talent but I would think that

1394
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:37,559
once interstate commerce is is something

1395
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:40,439
that we can do that it will also impact

1396
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:43,289
the likelihood of licenses and that that

1397
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,530
whole ecosystem will change how do you

1398
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:49,289
see Interstate Commerce impacting the

1399
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,540
licensing market well it's a great

1400
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:53,338
question so interstate commerce will and

1401
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:54,929
will change things pretty dramatically

1402
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:57,329
although I think interstate commerce is

1403
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:58,588
gonna take a while to roll out so even

1404
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,489
when it happens I don't think it's

1405
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,570
something that happens you know

1406
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,039
overnight

1407
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:04,079
I think the state-by-state nature of

1408
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,389
this probably stays in play for a

1409
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,930
while as interstate commerce is opening

1410
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:12,298
up but that you know that said I agree

1411
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:15,389
with you I think companies that are

1412
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:17,728
spending new tens of millions of dollars

1413
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:19,379
building out new hundreds of thousands

1414
00:51:17,728 --> 00:51:21,929
of square feet of cultivation space in

1415
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,729
the eastern half of the country you

1416
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:25,199
might find themselves in some real

1417
00:51:23,728 --> 00:51:26,669
trouble when interstate commerce does

1418
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,989
does open up I think interstate commerce

1419
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,909
you're right I think is largely going to

1420
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:32,099
be out west in terms of where the

1421
00:51:29,909 --> 00:51:34,170
cultivation is gonna happen you know the

1422
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:35,849
atmospheric conditions in the eastern

1423
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:39,659
half of the country are really tough for

1424
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:41,278
cultivation much more humid you much

1425
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:42,179
bigger temperature swings and so for all

1426
00:51:41,278 --> 00:51:45,298
those reasons I think you're gonna be

1427
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:46,978
seeing a large-scale greenhouses in in

1428
00:51:45,298 --> 00:51:49,849
places like you know the Central Valley

1429
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:53,308
of California and Arizona and Nevada

1430
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:56,548
Colorado even high deserts with with

1431
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:58,829
with your temperature spring swings and

1432
00:51:56,548 --> 00:52:00,838
and you'll see outdoor in you know many

1433
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:03,989
in in in other places other parts of

1434
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:05,818
California in particular you know as

1435
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:07,739
it's a bit of an aside you know when we

1436
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:09,778
talk about what we do at forefront and

1437
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:11,159
you know we're very focused in the

1438
00:52:09,778 --> 00:52:12,539
eastern half of the country we do some

1439
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:14,608
cultivation but it's very targeted and

1440
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:16,289
we're not doing a really massive scale

1441
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:17,759
cultivation because ultimately I think

1442
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:19,380
when that when that comes this

1443
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:21,088
commoditized is right I mean the prices

1444
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,749
the wholesale prices are going to fall

1445
00:52:21,088 --> 00:52:25,949
you know bulk you fall through the floor

1446
00:52:23,748 --> 00:52:27,598
once you can grow in a massive scale

1447
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:29,608
because ultimately like it's still a

1448
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,709
plant and particularly if you're talking

1449
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:33,298
about growing for extraction where you

1450
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:35,669
don't really care as much about the

1451
00:52:33,298 --> 00:52:38,608
quality of the buds you just care about

1452
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:41,159
volume right I mean the prices are gonna

1453
00:52:38,608 --> 00:52:42,179
come way way way down so when we look at

1454
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,618
you know when we look at where we're

1455
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:45,118
interested in playing the market we're

1456
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,829
not really interested in large scale

1457
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,599
cultivation they're gonna be a few

1458
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:50,930
really big winners in that market but

1459
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:55,019
there's gonna be a lot more losers

1460
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:56,608
it's not you know we just say it's kind

1461
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:57,958
of like likening and playing the end of

1462
00:52:56,608 --> 00:53:00,808
alcohol prohibition by buying a Hopf

1463
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:01,739
farm right well you know if you want to

1464
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:02,849
if you wanna you know you want to want

1465
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:04,440
to do really well in the alcohol

1466
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:05,969
industry you're the beer industry oh you

1467
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,349
don't want to be a farmer you know and

1468
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:09,958
hop farm so you wanna own brands you

1469
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:11,849
want to own distribution right so you

1470
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,409
want you want to own the the the

1471
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:15,059
distributors you want to own the popular

1472
00:53:13,409 --> 00:53:16,618
brands you want to own those

1473
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,880
distribution points but the hop farmers

1474
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:20,010
are the victims it's the least

1475
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,210
well part of the of the equation and I

1476
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,350
think the same ultimately is gonna be

1477
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:24,960
this is gonna be there for cannabis

1478
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:26,130
which makes the brand side right come to

1479
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,769
me back to your original question makes

1480
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,530
the brand sites so much more important

1481
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:33,239
because ultimately the feedstock that

1482
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:35,850
goes into that brand is gonna be really

1483
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:37,739
cheap and other than your really

1484
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:39,690
high-end artisan cultivators like the

1485
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:41,609
absolute best to the best right the

1486
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,590
prices for raw material the prices for

1487
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:45,510
raw flour is really gonna drop but

1488
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:47,610
brands tend to hold their value quite a

1489
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,080
bit better of course the value of those

1490
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,309
brands will come down as well so in

1491
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:51,929
different kinds of infused products

1492
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:53,789
brands so edibles and fate pens and

1493
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:56,369
everything else right those will hold

1494
00:53:53,789 --> 00:53:58,349
their value a bit more than the raw

1495
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:00,750
material and the flowers themselves and

1496
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:03,989
so I think establishing a really good

1497
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:06,900
brand now that can go state to state to

1498
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:09,839
state to state and establishes you and

1499
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,550
establishes a a following for that brand

1500
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,110
and in multiple states across the

1501
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:15,360
country is gonna be particularly

1502
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:17,789
valuable when the rails come down and

1503
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,289
interstate commerce because those brands

1504
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:21,960
are gonna then be able to buy their

1505
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:23,159
product a lot cheaper to create their

1506
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,510
product a lot cheaper and a ship

1507
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:27,299
elsewhere around the country a lot

1508
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:29,430
cheaper while the ball the value of

1509
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,470
their brands well it will come down some

1510
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:34,079
will hold this value a lot better than

1511
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:35,669
the then the raw flowers right now

1512
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,779
getting into that licensing game and

1513
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,639
making sure that you're doing everything

1514
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,310
you can to maximize the exposure of your

1515
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,960
brand I think is really important

1516
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:44,340
because you're gonna want to have those

1517
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,139
distribution channels right if you're

1518
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,579
Brent your brands become important but

1519
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:48,449
being able to distribute those through

1520
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,650
the distribution channels in the

1521
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:51,659
industry also becomes incredibly

1522
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,400
important the way that you get into

1523
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:55,829
those distribution channels today if

1524
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,500
your product manufacturer largely is to

1525
00:54:55,829 --> 00:55:00,869
license your brand to do manufacturers

1526
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,219
in other states and eventually you know

1527
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:03,809
if you do really well maybe you end up

1528
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:05,159
acquiring those those companies that

1529
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:08,190
you've licensed your brand's to down the

1530
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:09,779
road or you pump way more product

1531
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:12,150
through those license stores down the

1532
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,340
road and increase your you know increase

1533
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:17,670
your revenue that way I definitely think

1534
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:19,950
that the big-time players are very aware

1535
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:21,389
of this too and also the next level up

1536
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,769
right because you know I'm at

1537
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:23,699
conventions and at dinner and talking

1538
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:31,389
with these guys

1539
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:33,159
who are invested in highly scaling oil

1540
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:35,828
folk right and they're like yeah you

1541
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:37,868
know like we do our product

1542
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:40,420
manufacturing and we are aggressively

1543
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:43,630
licensing but we're not really all that

1544
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:46,480
invested into the production of the

1545
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:48,930
flowers to the materials to go into the

1546
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,519
oil because they're all waiting for

1547
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:52,960
international commerce well for the u.s.

1548
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:54,209
to get involved with international

1549
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,349
commerce because it's already occurring

1550
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:58,599
we're just not playing in it

1551
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:59,588
because everyone's waiting to like you

1552
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,220
know you know what it's going to be like

1553
00:55:59,588 --> 00:56:05,858
to have all of this flower grown in

1554
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:08,949
Mexico on inexpensive land with less

1555
00:56:05,858 --> 00:56:10,719
expensive labor they you know and they

1556
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:12,338
certainly will have the the intellectual

1557
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,048
property and talent to do the

1558
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:15,219
extractions and then just shift the

1559
00:56:14,048 --> 00:56:17,170
finished product here or where people

1560
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:20,259
will plug it into their actual products

1561
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:22,269
I mean you talk about that to somebody

1562
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:25,180
who hasn't really thought that through

1563
00:56:22,268 --> 00:56:27,189
in their single state business model and

1564
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:30,038
you can just see their face go pale

1565
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:32,139
whereas other hardcore players say for

1566
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:33,819
example in California like they're

1567
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,768
already planning on that happening

1568
00:56:33,818 --> 00:56:37,150
within the next 15 years and they're

1569
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:39,278
they already know what they're gonna do

1570
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:42,250
when that happens and I and I think that

1571
00:56:39,278 --> 00:56:44,889
that I think that that is shocking to

1572
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:46,059
people who haven't considered it yeah

1573
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:47,858
it's a great point I mean the

1574
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:49,750
international piece of this is something

1575
00:56:47,858 --> 00:56:51,909
that's largely off the radar in the

1576
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:53,679
United States but it shouldn't be

1577
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:56,199
because it's you know it's already going

1578
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:58,239
on you've got licenses for for large

1579
00:56:56,199 --> 00:57:00,879
scale cultivation and oil production in

1580
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:03,038
Colombia which by the way is where most

1581
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,720
of the the cut flower industry gets

1582
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:08,440
their flowers from in the US if you go

1583
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:10,239
into you know you buy it like yes yeah

1584
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,889
yeah yeah interesting you go to your

1585
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,909
supermarket you buy a bouquet of flowers

1586
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:15,639
I mean chances are those are those

1587
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:16,838
record in Colombia that most of the cut

1588
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:18,699
flower industry has moved down there

1589
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:20,578
over the last decade or so you know if

1590
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:23,169
you're buying greenhouse produced

1591
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:24,579
cucumbers or tomatoes or peppers in the

1592
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,650
United States chances are those are

1593
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:27,670
produced somewhere in Mexico it's

1594
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:30,519
possible they're produced in southern

1595
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,809
Arizona but most of that was produced in

1596
00:57:30,518 --> 00:57:33,338
Mexico and you're starting to see the

1597
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:36,160
rest of the world catch on to this I

1598
00:57:33,338 --> 00:57:37,869
think the you know the idea that the

1599
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:41,608
large-scale cannabis is going to be

1600
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:44,740
grown in a warehouses in you know Ohio

1601
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:45,289
is just silly I also think that when we

1602
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:47,389
look at what's go

1603
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:48,949
in the international scene you've got

1604
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:50,059
Canadian companies that are building out

1605
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:53,359
you know a million and a half square

1606
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:56,150
feet of greenhouse space to you know

1607
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,700
supposedly supply the global market in

1608
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:01,340
you know places like Ontario and I just

1609
00:57:58,699 --> 00:58:03,319
I can't imagine that in the medium term

1610
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,990
they're gonna be able to compete with

1611
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,960
places like Mexico or Columbia or

1612
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:11,899
Macedonia or Bulgaria or North Africa

1613
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:15,070
right all places that are big

1614
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:17,030
agricultural regions outside of cannabis

1615
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:18,710
right I mean you think about know who's

1616
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,640
gonna supply Europe well Kanna doesn't

1617
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,500
make a whole lot of sense

1618
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:22,460
Germany certainly doesn't make sense

1619
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,050
right you got people investing in

1620
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,510
massive green horses houses in Denmark

1621
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:28,370
what's cold that it's it's gray in

1622
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,110
Denmark it's cold it's gray in Canada

1623
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:32,119
and the cost of living and cost of

1624
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:33,170
expenses are really really high you look

1625
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:34,609
at what I know I would look at like

1626
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:37,369
where is all the tobacco in Europe grown

1627
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:39,079
it's grown from Albania to Macedonia and

1628
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:40,159
Bulgarian to Turkey it's like when you

1629
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:41,750
you know when you get when you pack a

1630
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:42,949
camels and it says fine Turkish tobacco

1631
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,059
and most that's actually grown in

1632
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:46,129
Macedonia Bulgaria

1633
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:47,420
there's not even grow some it's still

1634
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:49,400
grown in terms just Turkish health of

1635
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,409
ours it's Turkish cultivars that's

1636
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,119
exactly right but it's all grown in that

1637
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:54,829
Bay it's the tobacco belt of Europe and

1638
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,929
South Eastern Europe right like that's

1639
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:58,849
where cannabis will grow more

1640
00:58:56,929 --> 00:59:00,379
efficiently the cost of living a

1641
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:02,480
standard cost the production cost the

1642
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,880
labor there is substantially cheaper

1643
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,889
than anywhere in northern Europe

1644
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,660
the same is gonna go for North America

1645
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:10,219
and there's a reason why we don't do

1646
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:11,719
large-scale commercial agriculture for

1647
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:13,719
just about anything in Canada other than

1648
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:16,459
trees right because it's it's expensive

1649
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:17,989
and it's not a great climate for it and

1650
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,220
so I think you know that to think that

1651
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:20,750
like these Canadian companies are gonna

1652
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:24,230
wind up being the suppliers for the

1653
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:26,239
world I I think is kind of silly and you

1654
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,820
know similarly if you're focused on you

1655
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:29,449
know building a really large-scale

1656
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,309
large-scale infrastructure for

1657
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:35,029
cultivation and in most states in the

1658
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:37,369
United States it's gonna be a tough sell

1659
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,660
when first when interstate commerce

1660
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:40,579
opens up but then also when

1661
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:42,859
international commerce opens up new

1662
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:44,449
again outside of I think there will be

1663
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,769
some winners that come that can do this

1664
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:47,480
on a large scale in certain places in

1665
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:49,940
California in certain places in in

1666
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,519
Arizona Nevada where you can build go to

1667
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,780
conferences scale where they happen the

1668
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,650
conditions are right for it but even

1669
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:59,180
there I'll give you an anecdote from the

1670
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:01,460
from from the the greenhouse producing

1671
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:05,088
industry the the largest contiguous

1672
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:08,420
greenhouse in North America I believe

1673
01:00:05,088 --> 01:00:10,940
still is actually in Wilcox Arizona it

1674
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,389
was a company called euro fresh they

1675
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,889
were the largest producers of greenhouse

1676
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:17,420
cucumbers tomatoes and peppers in North

1677
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:18,650
America mostly shipping into the

1678
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,650
northern states in Canada and the winter

1679
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:24,019
months well they were pretty much put

1680
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:26,410
out of business by a very large scale

1681
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:28,789
greenhouse setup in southern Mexico

1682
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:31,068
right they just couldn't compete on

1683
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:32,179
price with massive scale greenhouse

1684
01:00:31,068 --> 01:00:34,940
production coming out of southern Mexico

1685
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:36,889
because cost of labor is so much cheaper

1686
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,240
down there then is even in southern

1687
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:39,379
Arizona where the atmospheric condition

1688
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:44,088
is actually really good for greenhouse

1689
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:47,568
production ironically the owner of that

1690
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:49,818
greenhouse in some Mexico happens to be

1691
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:52,940
the son of a former governor in the

1692
01:00:49,818 --> 01:00:54,440
state of Arizona that greenhouse put

1693
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,269
like I said put out a business the

1694
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,309
largest greenhouse producer of tomatoes

1695
01:00:56,269 --> 01:01:00,469
cucumbers and peppers in North America

1696
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:02,690
in Arizona and the owner then went and

1697
01:01:00,469 --> 01:01:04,548
got one of those satellite greenhouses

1698
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:05,960
not the largest one but the satellite

1699
01:01:04,548 --> 01:01:07,670
one of one of this company's large

1700
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,530
larger satellite greenhouses in

1701
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:11,930
snowflake Arizona and is now converted

1702
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:13,640
that to being a cannabis house and is

1703
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:15,588
now the largest a largest producer of

1704
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:18,828
cannabis in the state of Arizona well

1705
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:21,469
yeah the the the venture capital reacts

1706
01:01:18,829 --> 01:01:23,298
right it certainly does let me ask you

1707
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:26,868
this for those of us who don't have the

1708
01:01:23,298 --> 01:01:29,239
same comparison scale as you have you

1709
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:32,298
said a very large greenhouse and I think

1710
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:35,239
Wilcox Arizona versus another bigger

1711
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:36,739
greenhouse in southern Mexico how many

1712
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:38,449
acres would you say each of those

1713
01:01:36,739 --> 01:01:42,919
greenhouses were just to give folks in

1714
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:45,318
scale oh gosh general general idea I

1715
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,869
mean it was like a few square miles

1716
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:49,369
oh yeah like there Matt like we saw

1717
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:50,780
satellite footage of the one in Wilcock

1718
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:52,338
and you could see like a there was I

1719
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,740
think a nine hole golf course on their

1720
01:01:52,338 --> 01:01:58,190
property and that was like it was like

1721
01:01:54,739 --> 01:01:59,779
1/10 of the whole property it's massive

1722
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:01,548
massive you can see from sattell me if

1723
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,930
you look at the satellite footage if you

1724
01:02:01,548 --> 01:02:05,150
if you if you you can actually put it in

1725
01:02:02,929 --> 01:02:06,798
I think if you put in euro fresh Wilcox

1726
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:09,588
Arizona on on Google Earth or Google

1727
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:11,989
Maps you can see it on there and it's I

1728
01:02:09,588 --> 01:02:12,828
mean it's it's huge right not cool well

1729
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:14,838
thank you for going down

1730
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,999
that international rabbit hole with me

1731
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:19,489
I'm gonna circle us all the way back to

1732
01:02:16,998 --> 01:02:21,318
we are talking about the two sides of

1733
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:23,869
licensing agreements and negotiating the

1734
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:27,949
contract I would think that when the

1735
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:30,349
licensee goes to implement the contract

1736
01:02:27,949 --> 01:02:34,518
that they have set up with the license

1737
01:02:30,349 --> 01:02:36,380
sore that that they will often implement

1738
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:38,718
it incorrectly right either either

1739
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:40,278
because you know they've not done it

1740
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:43,729
before or because they want to make

1741
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:46,219
their own changes have you seen you know

1742
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:49,338
will poor implementations of license

1743
01:02:46,219 --> 01:02:51,829
contracts I have and that's where things

1744
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:54,170
get tricky to actually take you back to

1745
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:55,880
my earliest days and the industry side

1746
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:57,769
of things here back when I was with a

1747
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,150
company called can be which was it was

1748
01:02:57,768 --> 01:03:01,669
an offshoot of Harborside Health Center

1749
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:03,528
is a consulting business and actually we

1750
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:05,239
were we were way ahead of our time that

1751
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:08,478
can be we were actually in the process

1752
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:09,829
of getting a to be a the first cannabis

1753
01:03:08,478 --> 01:03:11,389
franchisor we were gonna franchise a

1754
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:14,420
couple of dispensary brands including

1755
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:16,818
Harborside back then before the company

1756
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:18,259
went under but so that's actually where

1757
01:03:16,818 --> 01:03:20,179
I learned a lot about what you have to

1758
01:03:18,259 --> 01:03:22,429
do for franchising but you know

1759
01:03:20,179 --> 01:03:24,048
Harborside Health Center in Oakland one

1760
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:25,608
of the one of the you know the best

1761
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:27,978
known names and biggest dispensaries in

1762
01:03:25,608 --> 01:03:32,208
the country opened into their first

1763
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:34,698
satellite location in San Jose and they

1764
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,690
did it initially through a licensing

1765
01:03:34,699 --> 01:03:37,099
agreement in this was something that we

1766
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:38,539
help them with it can be and the

1767
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:40,729
consulting side of things was to help

1768
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:44,269
get that new store up and running and so

1769
01:03:40,728 --> 01:03:47,448
they licensed the Harborside brand and

1770
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:49,458
some of the protocols to Harborside San

1771
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:50,568
Jose and so the owner was that the owner

1772
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,919
Harborside San Jose was a different

1773
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:54,798
owner than the owners of Harborside

1774
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,229
Oakland the original store and that that

1775
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,489
owner I won't name names frankly it's

1776
01:03:57,228 --> 01:04:01,698
been about a decade only remember the

1777
01:03:58,489 --> 01:04:03,228
name at this point but decided that you

1778
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:05,059
know he wanted to do different things

1779
01:04:03,228 --> 01:04:06,828
without with with the way Harborside was

1780
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:08,269
being run and so you know early on you

1781
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:09,709
saw some all signs like he wanted

1782
01:04:08,268 --> 01:04:11,088
everybody wearing you know polo shirts

1783
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:13,879
with the Harborside brand on them and

1784
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:15,978
you know part of what part no part of at

1785
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,298
least in Steve DeAngelo and the harbor

1786
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:19,308
site owners minds who a part of what

1787
01:04:17,298 --> 01:04:21,978
made her besides such a great experience

1788
01:04:19,309 --> 01:04:24,109
was allowing their employees to express

1789
01:04:21,978 --> 01:04:25,669
their individuality so they didn't have

1790
01:04:24,108 --> 01:04:26,420
you know dress codes outside of you know

1791
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:28,338
you can't wear something

1792
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,480
it's inappropriate to work but they

1793
01:04:28,338 --> 01:04:31,159
wanted people to be able to express

1794
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,139
their individuality to be able to relate

1795
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:34,368
better to people who came them into the

1796
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:35,539
stores and you know now you've got this

1797
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:36,200
licensee you saying we want everybody in

1798
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:38,358
a polo shirt

1799
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:39,710
Harborside logo but it's just once it's

1800
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:41,210
one small example there were a lot of

1801
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,730
other things like that where the license

1802
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:46,099
oh I think I can do better by doing XY

1803
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:48,079
and Z and it caused some real

1804
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:49,519
consternation amongst the original

1805
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,200
Harborside owners who felt like well

1806
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,940
this is not our brand you know this

1807
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,289
isn't it's not even necessarily that

1808
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,400
what they're doing is wrong but this

1809
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:57,230
isn't our brand and we're really

1810
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,539
concerned about the way that this brand

1811
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:01,159
is being implemented because we want to

1812
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:02,808
maintain the integrity of the Harborside

1813
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:05,088
pram something that we put our blood

1814
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:08,089
sweat and tears into and you know

1815
01:05:05,088 --> 01:05:11,150
ultimately it was a it was a little bit

1816
01:05:08,088 --> 01:05:13,880
of an ugly fight to to get control of

1817
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:15,829
that and back and and I can't go into

1818
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,088
the or I won't go into the details of

1819
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,309
what happened because there was you know

1820
01:05:17,088 --> 01:05:21,619
there was a little bit of ugliness there

1821
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:23,240
but you know by and large in the end he

1822
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:24,440
Harborside owners were able to take that

1823
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:25,578
back and they ended up you know they

1824
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,929
they ended up I don't know whether it

1825
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:28,730
was a buyout or exactly how it was

1826
01:05:26,929 --> 01:05:30,169
structured but basically took it took

1827
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:32,619
that control of that San Jose store and

1828
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:35,930
operated it as a company owned the store

1829
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:37,970
you know so essentially a real satellite

1830
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:40,368
Harbor side rather than a licensed

1831
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:42,259
harbor side because they just felt that

1832
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:43,338
through a licensing agreement like this

1833
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:45,890
they weren't gonna be able to maintain

1834
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:47,119
the integrity of their brand as well as

1835
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:48,259
they could if they were operating

1836
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,400
themselves or they could if they were

1837
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,750
franchising it but that you know that

1838
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,789
really wasn't an option at that point

1839
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,858
right on that makes a lot of sense so

1840
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:58,190
I've got one more question for you and

1841
01:05:54,858 --> 01:06:00,429
you know you have given a lot of ever in

1842
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:03,349
how you want to go about establishing

1843
01:06:00,429 --> 01:06:06,348
your license but how also not how to

1844
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:08,660
screw it up and so I'm sure that when

1845
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:10,880
you when you are you know at conventions

1846
01:06:08,659 --> 01:06:13,129
like I am and you're overhearing people

1847
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:16,160
talking about their their their efforts

1848
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:18,798
to license and and sometimes you hear

1849
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:20,269
something cringe and you know you hear

1850
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,190
something that makes you cringe and

1851
01:06:20,269 --> 01:06:25,309
we've heard a lot of those things today

1852
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:27,889
but what is one good piece of advice

1853
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:30,019
that you can offer people who are

1854
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:32,960
seeking to license their brand outside

1855
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:34,759
their origination state that they may

1856
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:39,230
not be thinking about and you hope to

1857
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:40,250
god they do think about oh I mean I

1858
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:42,170
think the two big thing

1859
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:44,300
and we've hit on on both of these at

1860
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:47,119
various points but I mean the two bigs

1861
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:49,160
that jump out at me is number one have a

1862
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,260
really good corporate attorney with

1863
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:52,579
experience in franchise law even if

1864
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,869
you're just doing licensing to make sure

1865
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:56,059
you're not running afoul of accent on

1866
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:57,858
franchise laws as I mentioned but you'll

1867
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:59,750
make sure things are papered up really

1868
01:06:57,858 --> 01:07:01,250
really really well if you want to be

1869
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:03,380
able to protect your brand you have to

1870
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:06,889
have a good contract that you can that

1871
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:08,750
you can rely on to you know as much as

1872
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:11,480
it's you know I'm not a litigious person

1873
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:13,280
you've got to have a good attorney from

1874
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,449
the very beginning to help you set this

1875
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,500
thing off right to help you structure it

1876
01:07:14,449 --> 01:07:17,449
the right way to help you write your

1877
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,829
contracts the right way having that

1878
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:20,960
having that having an having an attorney

1879
01:07:18,829 --> 01:07:23,539
there is absolutely critical and then

1880
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,280
the second thing is make sure you're

1881
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:28,159
really comfortable with the people that

1882
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,530
you are licensing to so do as much

1883
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:31,940
diligence as you possibly can on the

1884
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:34,369
principles and the managers of the

1885
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:36,500
company that you're licensing to you

1886
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:37,910
know really dig deep into who they are

1887
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:40,250
talk about you know talk about their

1888
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:41,809
their past business experience ask for

1889
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,550
references as to talk to people that

1890
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:44,900
they've worked with in the past asked if

1891
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:47,750
they've done licensing agreements and

1892
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,789
how those have gone in the past but you

1893
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,440
don't you know don't just rush into a

1894
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:52,579
deal because you really want to be in a

1895
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,139
state and you found somebody who's

1896
01:07:52,579 --> 01:07:55,460
willing to pay you the money because

1897
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:57,500
ultimately if you wind up in bed with

1898
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:59,900
the wrong person it can be really

1899
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:01,608
painful in a really expensive process so

1900
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,320
you really really want to do your

1901
01:08:01,608 --> 01:08:05,329
diligence well you really want to feel

1902
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,369
comfortable because ultimately you're

1903
01:08:05,329 --> 01:08:09,259
entrusting your brand or your protocols

1904
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:11,088
to this person and this company

1905
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:13,790
potentially for you know for a decade or

1906
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:15,139
more and you want to make sure that

1907
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:16,130
they're gonna do right by it that

1908
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:17,960
they're not gonna bring you know

1909
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,239
disrepute to your brand which ultimately

1910
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,680
will reflect negatively on you because

1911
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:23,209
when it comes down to it the consumer

1912
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,920
doesn't know if they're buying a brand

1913
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:26,180
in one state versus another state the

1914
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,009
consumer doesn't know whether that was

1915
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:30,048
licensed or whether that was produced by

1916
01:08:28,009 --> 01:08:31,609
the same company that produced it in the

1917
01:08:30,048 --> 01:08:33,619
first state and so if somebody does

1918
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:35,960
something wrong with your brand and and

1919
01:08:33,619 --> 01:08:37,759
and and and you bring some sorta

1920
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,920
disrepute to your brand that reflects on

1921
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,210
your brand all around the country and

1922
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,560
you can deal with some of that through

1923
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:43,759
litigation you could deal with some of

1924
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,589
that through contracts if you have to

1925
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,569
but the whole point is to not get there

1926
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:49,670
in the first place not have to do that

1927
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:50,630
kind of damage control and the best way

1928
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,730
you can do that is to make sure that

1929
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,779
you're really really comfortable with

1930
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:55,250
whoever you're

1931
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:57,829
gonna be working with and thinking about

1932
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:59,960
licensing your brand or your protocols -

1933
01:08:57,828 --> 01:09:01,880
I think you really hit on the point

1934
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,288
solidly when you say you know remember

1935
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,719
that this is a long term relationship

1936
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:07,429
because you know I think it's good

1937
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:09,259
advice for folks when they're looking at

1938
01:09:07,429 --> 01:09:11,328
somebody to date and to being a

1939
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:14,599
long-term relationship with you know

1940
01:09:11,328 --> 01:09:16,038
choose somebody who fights in a way that

1941
01:09:14,599 --> 01:09:18,199
you feel reasonable right because like

1942
01:09:16,038 --> 01:09:21,170
if you date somebody who fights fair or

1943
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:23,388
fights dirty you very well could end up

1944
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:25,219
with a really ugly breakup but if you if

1945
01:09:23,389 --> 01:09:27,739
you if you get in a relationship with

1946
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:30,259
somebody who is at least respectful

1947
01:09:27,738 --> 01:09:32,328
enough that you can fight fairly if you

1948
01:09:30,259 --> 01:09:34,578
do break up chances are it won't

1949
01:09:32,328 --> 01:09:37,729
necessarily be ugly and it surprises me

1950
01:09:34,578 --> 01:09:40,278
sometimes when I meet these folks who

1951
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:41,928
are aggressively licensing you know

1952
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:44,719
they're working on three or four or five

1953
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:46,099
state deals at the same time and you

1954
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:47,719
know I understand their priority that

1955
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:49,389
they want to quick and get them done so

1956
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:52,730
they can move on they've got a busy day

1957
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:55,849
but at the same time this is a serious

1958
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:58,578
relationship and and I always recommend

1959
01:09:55,849 --> 01:10:00,828
that you know you you go to the state

1960
01:09:58,578 --> 01:10:02,389
you meet with them try to you know try

1961
01:10:00,828 --> 01:10:03,679
to have more than dinner you know try to

1962
01:10:02,389 --> 01:10:06,559
do something with them because you can

1963
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:09,469
learn a lot by about the communication

1964
01:10:06,559 --> 01:10:12,380
of the other management team by how they

1965
01:10:09,469 --> 01:10:14,448
speak to their spouse or the rental car

1966
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:16,460
that they choose to drive or how they

1967
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:19,189
handle who's paying the check really

1968
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:21,529
simple things like that we can all pick

1969
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:24,500
up on oh all right I see how they would

1970
01:10:21,529 --> 01:10:26,599
be under stress because this is how they

1971
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:28,279
are in their normal life and and I think

1972
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:30,230
a lot of people figure out well you know

1973
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:31,819
we're all papered up everything I'm

1974
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:33,888
protected legally let's just move

1975
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:35,658
forward and I tell them you know you

1976
01:10:33,889 --> 01:10:37,639
really need to get some more face time

1977
01:10:35,658 --> 01:10:39,279
with these folks because you really are

1978
01:10:37,639 --> 01:10:41,328
getting into a relationship with them

1979
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,439
yeah I mean if you're you know if you're

1980
01:10:41,328 --> 01:10:44,420
at the point where you're having to

1981
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:46,939
enforce legal agreements right you're

1982
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,349
already at a really painful point so the

1983
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:49,549
whole point is to not get there and

1984
01:10:48,349 --> 01:10:50,690
frankly you can have really good

1985
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:51,440
contracts and really good legal

1986
01:10:50,689 --> 01:10:53,538
agreements and if you have an

1987
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:55,250
unscrupulous person the other side it

1988
01:10:53,538 --> 01:10:56,599
could be really painful and really

1989
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:58,760
expensive even if you ultimately wind up

1990
01:10:56,599 --> 01:11:00,110
winning right I mean I say once you get

1991
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,309
to the point where you're in a lawsuit

1992
01:11:00,109 --> 01:11:02,630
or you're in arbitration with somebody

1993
01:11:01,309 --> 01:11:04,849
the only winner is there or the attorney

1994
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:06,469
yeah right for everybody else involved

1995
01:11:04,849 --> 01:11:07,289
it's really painful it's really

1996
01:11:06,469 --> 01:11:09,390
challenging

1997
01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:10,710
usually wind up settling where you know

1998
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:12,570
nobody's really happy with the way

1999
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:13,949
things came out I think your advice to

2000
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:15,389
spend time with them and see how they

2001
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:16,949
interact with things is really good if

2002
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:19,289
anything you can do to get somebody

2003
01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:21,149
under stress but then to see how they

2004
01:11:19,289 --> 01:11:23,010
respond to stress before you get into

2005
01:11:21,149 --> 01:11:23,969
that relationship with them that kind of

2006
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,380
business relationship with them and I

2007
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:27,480
think that goes for licensing it goes

2008
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,710
for partnerships right jayvees any of

2009
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:30,869
these things are really important

2010
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:32,220
because it's easy to get along somebody

2011
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,989
when everything's going fine when you're

2012
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,310
talking about all the money you're gonna

2013
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:37,500
make together and the deal you're gonna

2014
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:40,170
do together and no everything's great

2015
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:42,420
and he'll stress it and that's when you

2016
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:44,190
see people's true colors and on that

2017
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:47,010
note you know I actually think one of

2018
01:11:44,189 --> 01:11:48,719
the one of the better ways and this set

2019
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:51,090
this this is gonna sound up it may sound

2020
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,740
a bit odd but one of the better ways to

2021
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,150
see how somebody deals with stress in

2022
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:58,159
particularly stress in an adversarial

2023
01:11:54,149 --> 01:12:01,799
relationship is actually through a a

2024
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:03,059
tough contract negotiation it's through

2025
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,860
the negotiation for the licensing

2026
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,970
agreement itself so that's something I

2027
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:08,670
think you don't necessarily in a rush

2028
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:10,680
because this is the one time when you

2029
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:13,289
are actually adversarial so you go from

2030
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,789
you know you meet somebody you talk

2031
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:16,019
about we should do some business

2032
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:17,609
together right everything's rosy

2033
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,710
everybody's happy everybody loves the

2034
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:21,719
idea right it's not adversarial at all

2035
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:23,130
you're really happy together

2036
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:25,949
that's you know that's kind of like the

2037
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:27,329
you know the honeymoon dating phase and

2038
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:29,069
then then you got to get things papered

2039
01:12:27,329 --> 01:12:30,479
up and then you start bringing lawyers

2040
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:31,739
in and then there's provisions of

2041
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,909
contrast that they they're they're not

2042
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:35,039
gonna like this provisions you're not

2043
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:36,539
gonna like there's push and pull it is

2044
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:37,500
inherently an adversarial relationship

2045
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:38,750
and I've always found this to be a

2046
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,010
little bit odd because you go from

2047
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:42,420
everything's great to all sudden we're

2048
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,710
on opposite sides and we're each pushing

2049
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,060
for what's in our own interests as

2050
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:46,590
opposed to the other person's interests

2051
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,670
and then as soon as that's done you're

2052
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:49,739
in the boat together and everything's

2053
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:51,210
good again right and you're on the same

2054
01:12:49,739 --> 01:12:53,399
team again and so it's this weird

2055
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:56,489
interim time when you're negotiating a

2056
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:59,789
contract when if you you know if you do

2057
01:12:56,489 --> 01:13:02,039
make it a real negotiation you get a

2058
01:12:59,789 --> 01:13:03,899
window into how somebody's gonna respond

2059
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:05,670
in an adversarial stressful relationship

2060
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:07,379
and I've actually had situations where

2061
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:09,329
I've been in contract negotiations with

2062
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:11,489
somebody and ultimately said you know

2063
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:14,069
what what not interested into his deal

2064
01:13:11,489 --> 01:13:16,260
like the the dollars and cents are there

2065
01:13:14,069 --> 01:13:18,420
the you know the the anything else lines

2066
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:20,010
up but but you guys are a-holes

2067
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,149
yeah but

2068
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,500
but it's been a nightmare to deal with

2069
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:24,210
in all this and what's gonna happen when

2070
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,890
we have a disagreement over the business

2071
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:27,480
right if this is a nightmare

2072
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:28,619
that's gonna be even worse and so I

2073
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:31,019
think you can learn a lot from

2074
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:32,399
contracting about how some was gonna

2075
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,720
respond and if you get a bad feeling

2076
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:35,429
about like I just don't like the way

2077
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:37,110
these guys are handling that you should

2078
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:39,300
probably walk away from that deal that's

2079
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:41,069
