00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,480
Cannabis smells really good most of us

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,730
buy cannabis based on its smell we

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,339
unscrew the mason jar stick our nose in

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,760
there and take a mighty whiff your body

6
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,528
tells you if you want that strain or not

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,420
during episode 11 we spend a lot of time

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,730
talking about cannabis terpenes with

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,519
world's famous neurologist and cannabis

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,368
researcher dr. Ethan Rousseau he

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,829
explained how THC CBD and the other

12
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:37,259
cannabinoids work in cooperation with

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,500
terpenes in the plant in what's called

14
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:43,049
the entourage effect the terpenes are

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,878
the plants aromatics they are why

16
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,878
cannabis smells so good whether it's

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:51,238
pine or chocolate citrus or skunker

18
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:53,549
any of the other aromas of cannabis one

19
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,820
of the essential aspects of healing with

20
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:58,709
cannabis simply is its smell if you

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,539

Shango 'lose my guest today is Ben

36
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,879
Cassidy co-founder of Tru terpenes we're

37
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,700
going to talk with Ben about cannabis

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,859
aromatics and aromatherapy how terpenes

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,109
are isolated for sale and how you can

40
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,118
use terpenes even without cannabis for

41
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,399
everyday healing and quality of life

42
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,618
welcome to the show then hey thanks for

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,450
having me on it's a real honour so you

44
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:50,519
know let's get right to it and talk

45
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,590
about where terpenes come from I mean we

46
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,670
know where they come from in nature but

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,469
how are isolated terpenes extracted or

48
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,879
manufactured one of my favorite things

49
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,739
about that question I think it's

50
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,750
probably you know once somebody gets

51
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:04,798
over the idea or starts to understand

52
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,968
what is a turkey and then they're

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,469
immediately like well how do you get

54
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:10,859
them so it's one of the ones that I get

55
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:13,439
asked the most and what I like to

56
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,270
initially say to people is you your ex

57
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,280
the probably a lot more familiar with

58
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,380
isolated terpenes than you think you

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,379
know and so let's just start with saying

60
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,479
that terpenes are separated from plant

61
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,000
material typically through two different

62
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,709
methods one of them is vacuum

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,949
distillation and one of them is steam

64
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,450
distillation and sometimes you can use

65
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:35,459
steam distillation in a vacuum

66
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:38,609
distillation setup but just to kind of

67
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,469
give a rough preliminary description of

68
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,690
vacuum distillation it's where we're

69
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:45,030
removing the atmosphere a lot of people

70
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:47,189
are starting to see these fancy

71
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,890
glassware setups for short path

72
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,719
distillation and other kind of high

73
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,619
level extractions within the cannabis

74
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,419
industry just know that the actual

75
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,939
purpose for these distillation setups

76
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,469
has been kind of more tailored towards

77
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:02,550
the essential oil industries for a long

78
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:04,259
time and so we're using the same

79
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,250
technology that's been around for a

80
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:07,769
while

81
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,180
to isolate terpenes with vacuum which

82
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,530
means like I said we remove the

83
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,990
atmosphere when you remove the

84
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,000
atmosphere you're basically making it

85
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,459
easier for things to boil off they don't

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,370
have to fight the vapor pressure for

87
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,830
them to become active in our in our in

88
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,050
an environment so vacuum distillation is

89
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,510
great because it allows you to use a

90
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,890
very little amount of energy and a

91
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:30,359
little amount of heat which means the

92
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:34,649
molecule doesn't get distorted or

93
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:38,520
destroyed steam distillation is a little

94
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,050
bit more widely used but it it allows

95
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,570
some of the molecules some of the

96
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,670
terpenes to kind of change in state

97
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,319
they're not necessarily just like they

98
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,449
were in the plants so there's kind of

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,829
positives

100
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:52,560
you know they steam distillation allows

101
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,600
for larger batch sizes and a little bit

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,509
less sophistication when it comes to

103
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,709
equipment vacuum distillation allows for

104
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:05,159
very very precise and gentle extraction

105
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:08,099
practices so yeah really it's a process

106
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,169
of taking raw plant material turning it

107
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,509
into an essential oil and then taking

108
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,250
that essential oil and slowly boiling

109
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:14,518
all of the individual components out of

110
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,129
it

111
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,739
oh one thing I'm not hearing any of that

112
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,569
is any chemical so so it sounds like the

113
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,149
two processes you've described so far

114
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:26,219
are actually pretty clean but if that is

115
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,329
correct you know there's there's

116
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,819
different industrial

117
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,348
applications or kind of distillation

118
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,060
procedures that somebody might take

119
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:35,699
plant material and they might use a

120
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,709
solvent under vacuum distillation or

121
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,009
steam distillation but in this case when

122
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:43,948
we're working with food grade and

123
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,300
sometimes above that grade chemicals

124
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,669
that people are going to be ingesting or

125
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,860
using in fragrances and in other kind of

126
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:51,628
related fields it's always been a really

127
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,580
important thing in our line of work

128
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,840
personally with our company to make sure

129
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,209
that there hasn't been any solvents used

130
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,188
in the process right on so so if that's

131
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:01,408
a good example I want to talk briefly

132
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:03,509
about the bad example you know a couple

133
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:04,978
weeks ago we had dr. Ethan Russo on the

134
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,800
show talking about terpenes and

135
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:10,408
cannabinoids in general and he surprised

136
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:16,939
me he said that some terpenes are

137
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:21,408
derived by they're coming from petroleum

138
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:24,389
refinement and it's a byproduct of that

139
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:25,978
what what tell me about that I don't

140
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,800
really know what they would do so give

141
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,360
me a little background so he actually

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,098
after listening that episode when I went

143
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,840
live which I just have to say is maybe

144
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,339
one of my favorite podcasts of all time

145
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,718
not just because I'm on your show at

146
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,060
this moment but really doesn't want to

147
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:40,889
know I loved it it inspired me to look a

148
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,538
little bit more into that because I had

149
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,120
a few ideas but I wasn't really sure

150
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:46,110
we've all you know a lot of people are

151
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,699
starting to hear at this point

152
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,778
especially when I go out and speak to

153
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,579
people you know people have heard

154
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:52,918
cannabis might have 200 terpenes and

155
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:55,050
that there's you know 30 or 40,000 in

156
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,060
nature and so it's a very diverse class

157
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,038
of chemicals so to say that something is

158
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,110
a terpene doesn't necessarily you know

159
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,978
it's not it's not a small class of

160
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,990
chemicals you're not going to

161
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:05,430
necessarily find the same terpenes in

162
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,019
cannabis that people are going to be

163
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,269
getting from these industrial sources

164
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:13,620
petroleum so when I looked into it what

165
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:15,930
I was able to find is people are

166
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,569
distilling in an industry has not really

167
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,158
people but industry has been distilling

168
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:24,718
petroleum for things like mineral

169
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:27,449
spirits kerosene naphtha and they they

170
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:31,168
as far as being a hydrocarbon molecule

171
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,580
they're very similar so I think for my

172
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:34,408
best guess without having reached out to

173
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,778
dr. Roy soda to confirm

174
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:39,899
based on what he was saying I think that

175
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:41,339
we can assume that any carbon-based

176
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,339
organic

177
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,619
substance that is you know made of

178
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:49,259
isoprene which is the building block of

179
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,879
terpenes can be considered a terpenes so

180
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,430
I think it's just such a wide diverse

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,319
class of chemicals that yes in fact many

182
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,090
of them can be derived from all sorts of

183
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,490
organic materials and you know a lot of

184
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,979
times we don't really think of mineral

185
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,750
spirits or kerosene gasoline you know it

186
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,340
seems so chemical in nature it doesn't

187
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,629
really seem like it's an organic product

188
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,609
but it really is you know that it's

189
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:12,240
derived from crude oil and through

190
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,360
distillation processes cleaned up so

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,340
that is kind of my best guess at this

192
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,990
point as to without having being able to

193
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,839
speak with him directly right on that

194
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,060
make sense and so it's not that we're

195
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,060
getting you know dhilae meaning from

196
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,449
citrus fruit and also from petroleum

197
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,129
it's a specific set of uncommon terpenes

198
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:34,229
that we would get from petroleum

199
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,750
production I believe and maybe you know

200
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,700
and maybe I I would even say those might

201
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,410
be some of the most prevalent terpenes

202
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,659
on the planet just because of how much

203
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,210
oil and how much crude oil is actually

204
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,400
distilled and then you know the number

205
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:49,310
of uses for kerosene and naphtha and

206
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,839
other kind of solvents of that nature

207
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,240
but yeah as far as the the ones that

208
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,060
we're all and at least in this community

209
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,829
quite interested in from my knowledge so

210
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,839
far I don't think you really need to be

211
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:03,959
concerned that it came out of gasoline

212
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,668
or crude oil producing gasoline for your

213
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,680
like your alpha-pinene or your mere

214
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:09,000
scene or Lynn Alou you know right on

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,310
cool well then that makes a good point

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,839
so even though there are truly trashy

217
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,180
terpenes they're not really the ones

218
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,219
that we work with in our sphere and so

219
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,470
so let's focus on our so let's talk

220
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,260
about the grades of terpenes because you

221
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,450
know one thing I have certainly read

222
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,159
people fighting about quality of

223
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,469
terpenes you know on Facebook and

224
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,210
different forums and and we all know how

225
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,729
ugly and inaccurate a lot of those

226
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:35,699
debates are so so let's go through you

227
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:39,030
know a couple different standards that

228
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,770
can be used to grade a turbine so I know

229
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:44,009
a lot of folks who are selling terpenes

230
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:47,100
they really push that they are organic

231
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:51,389
and food grade what does that mean to me

232
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:54,300
as you know as a purchaser as a consumer

233
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:54,778
of terpenes good question as far as food

234
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,389
grade go

235
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:59,578
is that really just means that the Food

236
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:02,789
and Drug Administration has placed this

237
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:06,388
substance on the approved food additives

238
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:08,519
list so you know our company really

239
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:11,850
focuses on only selling terpenes that

240
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,769
are found within cannabis and it just so

241
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,600
happens that we haven't ran into a

242
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,730
Caterpie and that was found in cannabis

243
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,620
that also was not found on the Food and

244
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,350
Drug Administration's list of approved

245
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,879
sources so in that case you know all of

246
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,120
the terpenes that we're working with our

247
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,220
food grade grass a lot some people might

248
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,889
not know grass stands for generally

249
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,600
recognized as safe that that means for

250
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,549
human consumption it doesn't mean that

251
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,079
it's you know it's free-range and you

252
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,649
can just bathe in the stuff it just

253
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,998
means that under the right circumstances

254
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:44,850
with proper product formulation that

255
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:47,399
this can be used in a cosmetic product

256
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,589
or at nutraceutical product or a food

257
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,149
product right on that makes sense and so

258
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,670
then the organic part that probably

259
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:57,389
refers to whatever your source plant

260
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:59,969
material was raised without pesticides I

261
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:02,490
so it definitely does if it's got like a

262
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,600
third-party certification on it for for

263
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:08,669
being organic but I actually have a

264
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,069
statement pulled up here it's actually

265
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:14,639
from it's an FDA FDA statement and

266
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:17,068
basically terpenes are by definition an

267
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:20,370
organic molecule they contain carbon

268
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:24,778
they they don't they don't exist outside

269
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:29,220
of being organic so the FDA FDA actually

270
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:31,799
allows all terpenes that are not

271
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,089
synthetically derived to be listed as an

272
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:38,068
organic substance because in isolation

273
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,679
they again it's a carbon containing

274
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:42,419
molecule it is organic I see that that's

275
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:44,399
like those of us who are nerds for

276
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:47,399
organic food we would call that little o

277
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,129
organic meaning yeah it's about it being

278
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,409
a natural source not necessarily whether

279
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:55,438
or not uses pesticides right which which

280
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:57,028
kind of brings me to the the point that

281
00:10:55,438 --> 00:11:00,838
I usually bring along bring around with

282
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:03,688
that which is that what's most important

283
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,429
I think with surfing's is looking at you

284
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:07,919
know what else is in the solution it's

285
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,449
very difficult almost impossible to get

286
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,828
a

287
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:14,930
100% terpene solution or even a 99.9 and

288
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:16,699
most of them it's just very difficult to

289
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,528
do and so you need to really look at

290
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,180
what is in that other percentage and

291
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:22,939
that's that really it becomes what's

292
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:27,289
important you know a lot of the terpenes

293
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,209
are very similar by chemical nature they

294
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:31,009
have almost the exact molecular weight

295
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:33,138
of one another under the right

296
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,409
circumstances within the plant and

297
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:38,600
outside of the plant they can actually

298
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:41,299
turn from one to another so it's very

299
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,860
easy for limonene alpha-pinene and muir

300
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,269
seen for instance to kind of phase shift

301
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,110
between each other

302
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:50,750
given their their environment so you

303
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,159
might have a bottle of 99.9 percent

304
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,078
lemony and it doesn't mean that it's

305
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,789
contaminated with something it really

306
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,559
might mean that that final fraction in

307
00:11:55,789 --> 00:12:00,948
there was some nursing and alpha pionen

308
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,268
that just could not be separated so

309
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:04,609
that's that's kind of what I like to

310
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:06,769
always bring it back around to is it's

311
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,320
with as far as these two Europeans go a

312
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:11,089
terpene is organic but you know the

313
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,949
package that it comes in and the other

314
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:14,600
substances and the solution is what we

315
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,169
really need to look at right on that

316
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,170
makes sense

317
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:20,719
so so in this industry do we really care

318
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:22,639
whether or not the original plant was

319
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,930
grown GMO or not is that is that

320
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,819
something that we want to be aware of

321
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:32,000
making purchases I you know I think you

322
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,528
have such a diverse crowd of people that

323
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,730
are consuming I think it's important to

324
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:39,019
make make sure that people are aware

325
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,250
beforehand that it came from you know

326
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,159
whatever they're consuming came from

327
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,720
non-gmo myself personally I come from

328
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,480
the camp that I I think that we should

329
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,610
investigate GMO I don't think that it's

330
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,980
something to be shunned but I also think

331
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,419
that everyone should be notified of what

332
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,829
they're consuming and people should have

333
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:57,289
the ability to opt out if they're not

334
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:58,789
interested and I think that you know if

335
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:00,679
that applies to food and I think it

336
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:03,198
applies to cannabis as well right on

337
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,318
that's a good point so that brings us up

338
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:10,099
to what is probably the most discussed

339
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:11,990
and possibly controversial part of what

340
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,970
isn't is not occurring because you know

341
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:19,620
terpenes got really hot and interesting

342
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,750
in being able to extract

343
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,019
anibus profiles right you know the first

344
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,850
time I saw this being done was at the

345
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:30,600
Emerald cup in let's see that would have

346
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:33,540
been 2015 Emerald cup tawny bruiser ah

347
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,540
from United cannabis had like all these

348
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,099
people around him and he was taking what

349
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,230
you know you know folks are bringing him

350
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:45,710
up what was otherwise like mediocre

351
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:48,629
slabs of shatter and and he was taking

352
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:52,110
you know Canada's profiled terpenes and

353
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:53,309
like painting the the dab oil and then

354
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,990
the folks would go in dab it they're

355
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,769
like oh that's the best Gorilla Glue

356
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,649
I've ever had

357
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,778
so they were they were adding terpenes

358
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,759
after the fact and people were going

359
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,950
bananas it was it was it was quite

360
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,860
impressive to see everyone's excitement

361
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:11,160
about taking mediocre cannabis product

362
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,860
and super charging it with with a

363
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,329
terpene profile so so you know after I

364
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,820
got into that I realized how

365
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:21,089
controversial it was about whether or

366
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,540
not you know different cannabis

367
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:28,050
companies were either a taking actual

368
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:31,319
cannabis flowers and distilling from

369
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:35,669
that to get the actual terpenes that

370
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,610
words in a batch of flour or be doing

371
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:41,370
research to find out what terpenes were

372
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:45,180
in safer groups say for example Gorilla

373
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:51,810
Glue and then hand blending food-grade

374
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:53,879
terpenes to to emulate what the terpene

375
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:56,278
profile would have been if you would've

376
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,740
taking taken them directly out of the

377
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,958
flower and man people will fight all day

378
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,459
long on social media about that so so

379
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,949
why don't you break it down for us

380
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:08,039
you know the differences between those

381
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,959
two approaches absolutely I think I

382
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:12,689
first would just start by saying my same

383
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,889
opinion about the GMO substance kind of

384
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:20,430
applies to this as well I think that you

385
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:22,949
know isolated terpenes we don't have the

386
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:24,299
entire catalog of 200 available to us at

387
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,400
this point and there's a couple of

388
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,708
different reasons for that some of them

389
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,779
are incredibly difficult to have an

390
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,969
isolation and that's because they might

391
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,829
have a they might have a

392
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,840
boiling-point around room temperature or

393
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,910
eighty degrees or so which is why when

394
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,410
you're in a hot row room it really just

395
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,850
smells something special and you're

396
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:44,610
never really going to be able to

397
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,290
recreate that or fully capture it with a

398
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,029
with a final product you know live

399
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:50,009
resins and other extractions are doing a

400
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,559
pretty good job of capturing as much

401
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:54,860
terpene as possible but at the end of

402
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:59,699
the day there are some of these

403
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:02,129
compounds that are not easily isolated

404
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,780
and so what that leads to is the

405
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:06,570
terpenes that we actually have at our

406
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:09,569
disposal so add-back are primarily the

407
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,270
heaviest most stable molecules the mono

408
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,790
and sesqui turbines so if you you know

409
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:18,029
if you were imagining you know you let's

410
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:21,029
say you started with a really glue for

411
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:23,069
just to follow your example and you took

412
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,559
that into the testing lab that we prefer

413
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,020
to use this time SC labs and they gave

414
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:30,269
you the terpene analysis back which at

415
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,309
this point they count 434 of them you

416
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:35,549
know you would have it would that that's

417
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:37,439
going to tell you the natural ratio that

418
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:39,750
the terpenes that they're able to test

419
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,340
for are found in in that plant and then

420
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,009
there's one other special number on that

421
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,019
page and it's the total content by

422
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:49,169
volume so you're going to see all these

423
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,539
different ratios you know and it 34 of

424
00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:53,909
them you'll see alpha pining at 3% and

425
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:55,649
and beta pining a two-person yawn so

426
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:58,559
it's going to be listed out in either

427
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:00,600
percentages or by milligrams per gram

428
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,609
and then at the bottom it's going to say

429
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,470
but the total content of that entire

430
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,970
gram was 4% or 7% or something along

431
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,430
those lines it's going to vary depending

432
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,250
on if it was a flower sample if it was

433
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,900
grown indoor/outdoor or if it was a

434
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,369
concentrate and how it was extracted so

435
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,009
what's really important to look at is

436
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:22,529
you know if you're looking to emulate

437
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:25,769
cannabis naturally you're going to want

438
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:27,869
to only add back those mono and sesqui

439
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:30,029
terpenes but let's just keep it easy say

440
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:33,000
those 34 Kirkenes you're going to want

441
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:35,399
to look at what what does the plant

442
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,920
naturally produce at its best case

443
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,780
scenario fresh off the plant before any

444
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,050
sort of degradation has happened or miss

445
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:43,629
handling

446
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:46,450
and then try to emulate that so not just

447
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,130
slopping it on and you know and assuming

448
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,340
that more is going to be better but

449
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,410
really kind of precisely maybe even take

450
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,699
you know measuring measuring big like

451
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,090
that's again we'll follow your example

452
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,380
so we'll say a slab of concentrate

453
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:02,169
running that running atropine tests on

454
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,330
that and seeing where it is right now

455
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:06,509
currently as like kind of a blank canvas

456
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:09,629
without any additives to it and then

457
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:12,460
let's say you get a a plus top-shelf

458
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,380
concentrate that you really admire from

459
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,970
another source you know somebody else

460
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,370
did some live resin and you have some

461
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,650
standard vho you could look at the

462
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:22,629
terpene content of that live resin and

463
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,570
compare it to the terpene content of

464
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,910
your BHO and you could spike all of the

465
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:31,089
individual mono and sesqui torian's to

466
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,759
make it more like the the a plus

467
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:35,859
medicine but so I think you know that's

468
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,609
best case scenario what you saw Tony

469
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:41,289
doing was because he because you know

470
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:43,529
the the product he was working with is

471
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:47,799
supposedly cannabis derived terpenes

472
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:51,789
it's taking those natural ratios in the

473
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,109
proper dilution and adding it back so as

474
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:55,599
you know nature already did all the

475
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:57,459
heavy lifting with that I really am a

476
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,019
fan of those sorts of products I think

477
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,759
that the you know the only reason that

478
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,970
I'm in the business that I am right now

479
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,349
is because they're very cost prohibitive

480
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,289
they're about you know 15 to 20 times

481
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:10,299
more by the time you get to the consumer

482
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:13,629
level of somebody buying a milliliter

483
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:16,109
next to a milliliter cannabis derived

484
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:19,030
first isolated plant drive terpenes and

485
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:21,159
they're also a little bit less shelf

486
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:22,660
stable and a little bit more

487
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,940
inconsistent as well you know somebody

488
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,070
has to continue to grow that crop of

489
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,400
cannabis under the same conditions to

490
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:32,500
produce the same to produce the same

491
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,940
flower to then be distilled under this

492
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,079
that you know it's just it's a lot of

493
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,279
new kind of tech coming into play and

494
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,689
people haven't been isolating to

495
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,329
Europeans for a long time and it's a

496
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,940
little bit of a not as as much available

497
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:47,409
as far as like source material yeah you

498
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,150
know you can only grow so many plants

499
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,259
most places in this world and then you

500
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,660
have to decide what you're going to do

501
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:55,140
with those and I'm just not convinced

502
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,279
personally that still

503
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,820
Cannabis drive terpenes out of that is

504
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:03,789
maybe the necessarily the best use for

505
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:05,379
really good cannabis so I think kind of

506
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:07,240
as a compare to get back to like

507
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,710
comparing apples to apples you know I

508
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,720
think limiting from an orange and

509
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,548
limiting from cannabis they're

510
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,400
chemically identical and this is true of

511
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:17,168
all terpenes the other ones that I think

512
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,419
people might be familiar with our lintel

513
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:22,809
rule and lat from lavender and you're

514
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:24,970
seen from hops but what I think

515
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:27,099
ultimately it comes down to is the

516
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,380
importance of purity and in relation to

517
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:32,230
contaminants you know if you have five

518
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:35,470
milliliters of limiting you want that to

519
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:38,380
be as close to as possible a pure

520
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:42,910
limiting and if you're dealing with like

521
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,169
a distillation like what we work in you

522
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,808
know achieving those super high

523
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,580
percentage purities is one thing you

524
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:52,839
know you want to be a but we should have

525
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:54,369
everything above 96% but then the other

526
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,279
side of that coin is making sure that

527
00:20:54,369 --> 00:21:00,359
the other 4% that's remaining is not

528
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:03,039
pesticide solvents or other degraded

529
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,469
organic material one thing that a lot of

530
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,509
people might not be familiar to hearing

531
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:12,009
is that you know things chemicals like

532
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:14,890
acetone or a couple of other like known

533
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:16,839
solvents are actually can be produced by

534
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,750
the degradation of plant material of

535
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:22,629
other natural organic material as it as

536
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,970
UV and time kind of play their course so

537
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:28,030
I think that was a little bit of a

538
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,850
roundabout so I apologize but really I

539
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:31,750
think as far as source comes and maybe

540
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:34,480
you could actually return to the

541
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,069
question yeah right on so so bringing it

542
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,589
back to that the cannabis strain

543
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:39,730
profiles part and you answer my question

544
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,779
really well explaining the difference

545
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,400
between the cannabis derived and the

546
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:47,379
plant food derived but you know what it

547
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,669
occurred to me is that when you describe

548
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:56,049
how cannabis derived is going to you

549
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:59,500
know be 15 to 20 percent more extent eat

550
00:21:56,048 --> 00:22:01,269
iams more expensive what that made me

551
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,940
think of you know I've seen a handful of

552
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:05,619
terpene companies and I know the prices

553
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,930
they charge you know a lot of these

554
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:09,809
folks that kind of

555
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:12,900
right there copy to suggest that there

556
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:15,960
derived their profiles are extracted

557
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,759
from cannabis they just can't be doing

558
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,620
it for the price that they're selling it

559
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,539
at and it sounds to me like you know

560
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,159
some companies are probably you know

561
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:27,149
being a little creative with their

562
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,920
copywriting you know just because it's

563
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,690
so much cooler you know people generally

564
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,970
think it's cooler to take your terpenes

565
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,710
directly from the flower but that's so

566
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,049
cost prohibitive that maybe they're

567
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,200
writing their copy too to kind of

568
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,609
suggest that in an abstract way but when

569
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,819
when push comes to shove they're

570
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:47,549
actually pulling terpenes from from food

571
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:51,149
plans and then just doing their absolute

572
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:53,069
best to make a blend that matches the

573
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:56,970
terpene profile that they got on a test

574
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:59,490
it yeah and I mean I guess to start off

575
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,549
to say I we really made it our we took a

576
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,799
position early on because everything

577
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:06,869
that you just said was our thoughts that

578
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,480
I've had and that our company has had

579
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:12,449
but we took a position early on did not

580
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,339
try to police the industry just because

581
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,500
you know there's so much to focus on

582
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:19,889
within the organization that what people

583
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,730
are doing on the outside you know we're

584
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,880
good you know I just don't have a

585
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,910
crystal ball so what I will say is that

586
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,490
I think it's not it I think part of what

587
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,779
you said with people to copy I think

588
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,150
people are getting pretty creative with

589
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,160
their copy at least in my experience

590
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,019
I've bought from several of the

591
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,900
companies that suggests that it's

592
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:42,450
cannabis derived and what it really

593
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,009
appears to me is as a something along

594
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,920
the lines of like a cold trapped

595
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:48,990
cannabis terpene from a vacuum oven or

596
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,050
maybe even a you know a distill batch

597
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,789
combined with isolated terpenes and this

598
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:55,440
isn't a new practice by any means you

599
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:58,589
know the the essential oil and perfume

600
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,410
industry since I think probably its

601
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:03,599
inception or very shortly thereafter has

602
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:07,560
been plagued with companies that will

603
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:09,179
take lesser at lesser oils and cut more

604
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,700
expensive oils to make them stretch

605
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,470
further so yeah I mean it's it's a

606
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,080
practice that in one way or another is

607
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,850
happening we just like I said we never

608
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,230
really wanted to police the industry and

609
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:19,969
we've never been embarrassed that we

610
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,950
sell

611
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,509
plant-derived terpenes so we've just

612
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,910
always made it blatantly obvious that

613
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,849
these are from other sources and tried

614
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,940
to give people the tools to decide if

615
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:33,619
working with us is is within there know

616
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,480
what kind of within their guiding

617
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:37,219
principles for what their business is

618
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,740
trying to achieve right on that makes a

619
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,329
lot of sense you know no reason for you

620
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,210
to police the industry you know one of

621
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:46,490
the things about having both a free and

622
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,980
open market and also the Internet if

623
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,599
somebody is selling schlock it's the

624
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,710
words going to get around and they're

625
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:54,379
going to have to deal with that better

626
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,798
to focus on your own startup company and

627
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,179
your own science and go from that so you

628
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,918
know we're kind of late for our first

629
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:02,210
break so we're going to get to that but

630
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,440
anybody who's been listening to the

631
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,539
first set here and they're like man

632
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,070
they're kind of leaning on the on the

633
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:09,529
manufacturing and science part a little

634
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:11,869
heavy do not fear set 2 is going to be

635
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:13,660
all about how to use terpenes in

636
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:16,339
everyday life so please stay for that

637
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,798
you are listening to shaping fire i'm

638
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:21,639
Shango louse and my guest today is Ben

639
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,349
Cassidy co-founder of true tear pains

640
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,179
for anyone who is paying attention to

641
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:28,339
cannabis medicine it has become

642
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:30,410
incredibly apparent that full extract

643
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:32,509
cannabis oil known to some as Rick

644
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,580
Simpson oil is the cornerstone of

645
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:37,129
healing humans with medical marijuana if

646
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:38,928
you own a medical dispensary or retail

647
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,990
store you know that your customers are

648
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:43,490
asking for it every single day and if

649
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,160
you have been working with patients and

650
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,329
seeking out quality full extract oil in

651
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,450
the Pacific Northwest

652
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:52,369
you know the provider deep-green Kat

653
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,860
Jeter and her team at deep green have

654
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:56,750
been making full extract cannabis oil

655
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:59,359
and setting the standards for quality

656
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:02,179
and exact dosing for years in Washington

657
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,668

product as whole plant while the assured

664
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:22,250

knowing your sources reputable trusts

00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,808
your host Shango low so our guest this

704
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:53,878
week is Ben Cassidy co-founder of Tru

705
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:56,579
terpenes so the first set we were

706
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:59,459
talking all about how isolated terpenes

707
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:02,189
are extracted or manufactured and the

708
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,369
differences between terpenes that come

709
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,259
from from raw cannabis versus come from

710
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:09,509
plant sources well that's really

711
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:11,190
interesting for people who are nerdy

712
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:12,179
about the science part but I'm sure

713
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,769
there's people who are listening who are

714
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,559
like alright I got it I know what

715
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:18,509
terpenes are now how do I use them in my

716
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,220
everyday life and you know I'm going to

717
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:22,079
start with the example that is actually

718
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,028
how I met you then and what really

719
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,999
impacted me and how I knew I wanted to

720
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:29,368
have you on the show this past year in

721
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:31,829
December I was down at Emerald cup and

722
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:34,378
then was part of a group of cannabis

723
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:36,480
owners and I and we all rented this this

724
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:37,849
wine Villa so we call se together it was

725
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,749
really great right because all these

726
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,908
cannabis business owners were all

727
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:44,608
learning from each other and at one

728
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:46,179
point Ben went around the room and he

729
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:49,028
gave everybody just a live

730
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:51,970
a bit of beta-carotene in their hands

731
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:54,730
and encourage them to you know cup their

732
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,950
hand and inhale deeply and I've never

733
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,200
done that before and made it carry a

734
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:02,619
flame just smelled so good and it made

735
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,538
me feel so calm and it made me realize

736
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:08,199
that even though up to this point all of

737
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:10,359
my care about terpenes was really what

738
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,058
was in the flower I never really thought

739
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:15,969
about using the terpenes independently

740
00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:18,249
from cannabis for quality of life and so

741
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,308
you know since that time I've gotten an

742
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:24,190
you know an ultrasonic terpene diffuser

743
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:27,009
and and you know while you showed me how

744
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:29,288
to dad it so so let's go through some of

745
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:32,470
those ways that people can use terpenes

746
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:34,690
at home without actually burning or

747
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,629
debating some marijuana okay yeah

748
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,820
definitely I think the just like you

749
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:43,118
were saying the the first and I think

750
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:44,980
maybe easiest is probably it's through

751
00:29:43,118 --> 00:29:48,220
the process of what you've called hand

752
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,110
huffing I want to just first start by

753
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,919
saying what I actually had everybody try

754
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:56,019
at the Emerald cup was a was beta Kari

755
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,269
athlean but I had mixed it one to one

756
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:00,009
with with just an extra virgin olive oil

757
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:02,440
and I think that that's just an

758
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:03,849
important note to start off with for

759
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,350
anybody at home that might want to try

760
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,719
this just because we want to make sure

761
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:11,069
just like any other essential oil that

762
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,499
we're going to put it with a carrier oil

763
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:16,329
unless you're you know a Troma therapist

764
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:17,710
or an expert that's been using these for

765
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:19,689
a really long time I think you can

766
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,749
always assume that you should probably

767
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:25,210
cut them with something because they are

768
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:26,528
very just kind of powerful chemicals

769
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,740
each and every one of them many of them

770
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:31,179
act as solvents in high purities so just

771
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,169
want to start with that and say make

772
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,960
sure that you're being safe and

773
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:37,509
practicing you know good aromatherapy

774
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,190
practices so with hand huffing the

775
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:40,868
reason I really wanted everybody to

776
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,990
apply the beta Kari awfully into their

777
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:46,628
hands was kind of twofold it is one of

778
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,480
the most relaxing and calming you know

779
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:51,219
it's to our particular mixes derived

780
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,929
from a combination of black pepper and

781
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,139
clove and you know it very much

782
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:58,750
resembles both of those plants it's it's

783
00:30:55,138 --> 00:31:00,429
spicy and earthy and so just just

784
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,740
when you come into contact with it it's

785
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,660
immediately everything I think that

786
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,269
you've just described it's relaxing and

787
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,830
it's it's really you know it's in my

788
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,509
opinion it's you know you people have

789
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:12,039
heard chew on black peppercorns if

790
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:14,680
you're you know if you're too high or

791
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:17,470
something of those nature and I think

792
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,420
that beta carry a Selene is is so

793
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,850
interesting for that purpose because

794
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,670
it's not overly stimulating it's not

795
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:26,799
in-your-face too strong and it's one of

796
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:30,490
the more benign terpenes and by that I

797
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,169
mean that you can be around a lot of it

798
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,630
before you start to kind of get to an

799
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,550
intoxicated level whereas there's some

800
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,560
terpenes like let's say terrain e all

801
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:41,019
which is the main terpene and roses and

802
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,659
geraniums which really can start to have

803
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:44,950
an effect on you very quickly so I like

804
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,730
to start with beta carry ethylene it

805
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,930
helps people get their hands turkey and

806
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,910
and then we move from there that the

807
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,259
second reason why it so it's very it's

808
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,150
just it's a good learning tool and

809
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:56,920
nobody's going to get hurt from it in

810
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,700
most cases the other reason being is

811
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,710
it's a topical anesthetic and it works

812
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,180
very quickly so that's that's the other

813
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,640
reason why I really like to introduce it

814
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,680
to people is because you know everybody

815
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,380
at one time or another in their life or

816
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,750
most people have had the opportunity you

817
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,220
know to have a sore muscle or something

818
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,349
along the lines where they rubbed a

819
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,559
cream on and we're expecting some sort

820
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:23,919
of relief and you know there's obviously

821
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,349
varying degrees of success with those

822
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,090
some of those like an icy hot pack and

823
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:31,809
like vicks vapor rub for instance

824
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:33,009
actually are containing terpenes but so

825
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:34,119
with the hand huffing i just want to

826
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:36,220
always encourage people to make sure

827
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,639
you're taking you're using an olive oil

828
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,430
or coconut oil sweet almond oil you can

829
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,470
get on google and look around for

830
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:47,830
aromatherapy carriers and you'll find a

831
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:50,350
list of 30 but you know the main ones

832
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:52,329
that i really like to do that with are

833
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:54,789
the primary ones from cannabis and i

834
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:56,439
think that it's just because i'm so

835
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:58,149
familiar with them and i kind of know

836
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,580
what to expect when working with them so

837
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,500
should we go down that road or would you

838
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:04,809
like to go into other methods yeah let's

839
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,759
go into other methods so you recommended

840
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:08,889
to me an ultrasonic diffuser which i

841
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:10,220
picked up and i love when you go ahead

842
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,200
and explain that in

843
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,630
why it's making my room smells so good

844
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,090
right now yeah that's actually probably

845
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:20,240
the way that I consume the most terpenes

846
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:22,639
and everybody within our company is the

847
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,839
ultrasonic diffuser which basically is

848
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:33,288
just using a small amount of water and a

849
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:35,569
and a vibrating sound waves to nano to

850
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:37,308
make the particles of the of the

851
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:38,928
essential oil and water into nano

852
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:41,000
particles so that they can be puffed up

853
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:43,130
into the air and naturally breathed in

854
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,490
in lower concentrations so whereas we're

855
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:48,890
getting a direct inhalation of the of

856
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,259
the extract when it's in our hands we're

857
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,549
kind of filling the room ambience with

858
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:55,970
terpenes when we use an ultrasonic

859
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:58,190
diffuser and that's like I said I think

860
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,159
I feel like it is a little bit more

861
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:03,350
natural because we're getting kind of a

862
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,240
diluted it's come combined with oxygen

863
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:06,439
we're breathing it over there period of

864
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,989
time

865
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,570
I personally start my day every single

866
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:13,309
day in my office I close the door and I

867
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,369
kick it on and I put some lemonade and

868
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:19,219
sit all in it both citrus derived

869
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:21,679
terpenes and that really just seems to

870
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:24,918
be kind of like even had a looted too in

871
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,838
his episode very sunny and bright and

872
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:28,309
alerted and so that's that's kind of the

873
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:32,389
way that I'll start my day if I'm sick

874
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:34,549
or thinking that I'm getting sick I use

875
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:37,250
alpha tiny alpha tiny necks as a

876
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,019
bronchodilator and anybody that's had

877
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,019
interaction with it I think we'll it

878
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:43,550
testify that that it's kind of opens the

879
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,898
lungs and makes it just much easier to

880
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,830
breathe that's that's what you had

881
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:53,179
mentioned earlier Shango and you know

882
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:55,069
it's just it's it's very it's low-impact

883
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:58,369
it's certainly there I think

884
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:01,010
therapeutically active but it's not

885
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:02,900
gonna not going to give you any sort of

886
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,910
chance to you know inhale something

887
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,460
that's too potent or too strong and it's

888
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:08,838
not going to sense your hands or you

889
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,309
know anything like that it's just very

890
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:13,608
easy to set in the corner of the room

891
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:15,409
and let it run in just one of my

892
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:18,348
favorite reactions to kind of take note

893
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:20,029
of is the before and after somebody

894
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,800
that's never used one before and you

895
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,330
know a lot of people you know

896
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,240
different differing opinions on how

897
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,739
aromatherapy works and what it is but to

898
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,809
you know I just like to let it speak for

899
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,519
itself so to have somebody sit down in a

900
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:33,590
room and start a conversation and let

901
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,750
the diffuser run for a few minutes and

902
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,309
then to watch the face change as they

903
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,469
realize that they feel different than

904
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:41,989
before you know four or five minutes

905
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:43,489
before that I just I just really love

906
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:45,379
the aromatherapy diffuser and that's

907
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:46,969
what I would generally recommend to

908
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,460
anybody that's starting to get into

909
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:51,649
terpenes and having interest in them

910
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,659
just because it's it's low-impact

911
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,990
it's pretty cost effective terpenes will

912
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:58,279
last a long time in it and it really

913
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,649
gives you the ability to start to

914
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,450
investigate them and then once you start

915
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,849
to learn more about other ways of

916
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:06,829
preparing and consuming them then you

917
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:08,089
can kind of move on to that right on

918
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:09,349
that makes a lot of sense you know one

919
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,390
of the things that I found really easy

920
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:14,150
too is you know while there were really

921
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:16,879
nice ones that were 200 bucks I got mine

922
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,670
for 50 bucks on Amazon and you know all

923
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,630
I did was search ultrasonic diffuser and

924
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,430
then there were you know all these

925
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,050
different ones that that I could choose

926
00:36:22,429 --> 00:36:26,179
from and yeah you know they're cooler

927
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:29,720
ones that I can upgrade to but I'm up

928
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:32,899
and going for 50 bucks and and not only

929
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:34,849
that but I like that it's a way to share

930
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,920
terpenes with other folks too

931
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:38,299
you know I'll have people over for you

932
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,490
know a dinner party or loaded together

933
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,670
or whatever and it will fill the room

934
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:45,409
and people always comment on the smells

935
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,510
and that always gets me talking about

936
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:49,670
terpenes and then you know turns into a

937
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:52,880
little education thing sometimes which I

938
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,869
obviously am into so before we go to the

939
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,180
commercial let's let's talk about

940
00:36:55,869 --> 00:37:00,739
dabbing terpene by themselves you gave

941
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:02,119
me a really great experience that know

942
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:03,500
we were down there in California and I'd

943
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:09,650
like you to describe it for other folks

944
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:12,050
yeah I just for for sake of everybody

945
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,059
else in our organization who isn't a

946
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:17,240
huge fan of me always showing that off

947
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:18,860
but I think no running into people like

948
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:22,119
yourself who are so passionate about it

949
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:24,800
and willing to to you know experience it

950
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:28,069
we had actually inhaled a very small

951
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,750
amount of alpha-pinene for the effect of

952
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,820
opening our lungs and I just want to say

953
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,340
that the the company that I'm with does

954
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,860
not really endorse that practice are we

955
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,180
really really

956
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,950
suggest that people use terpenes for

957
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:43,759
topical and oral administration at this

958
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:45,859
time but I but things I want to talk

959
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,620
about it if you want to talk about it

960
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:52,550
exactly basically what we had done is we

961
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:54,440
had taken a like a fait battery mod

962
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,330
that's what they're called the one that

963
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,480
I had particularly went from five to

964
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:02,869
forty watts and we put a ceramic nail on

965
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,570
it that had a kind of like a to go water

966
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:09,500
pipe attached to it and so we basically

967
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:12,320
had taken just deep about a third of a

968
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,559
drop which I usually measure out with a

969
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,940
toothpick or something of that nature

970
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,289
we had dipped down into the alpha piney

971
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,639
and taking the drop and put it on the

972
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:21,469
nail and I think that this is really

973
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,569
important to where as people when people

974
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:25,579
are dabbing cannabis concentrates they

975
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:27,110
generally already have the nail at the

976
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:29,360
temperature that they'd like it to be at

977
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:31,280
which then they go in and they inhale it

978
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,519
and it all vaporizes but I haven't

979
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,960
really found the right temperature for

980
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,989
that and so what's worked really well

981
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,780
for me is starting with a cold nail

982
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:44,149
adding the terpene and then allowing it

983
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:46,340
to come up to temperature with the nail

984
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,410
and then it paper eise's at exactly the

985
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,730
right point as soon as it as soon as

986
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:54,139
it's hit the temperature where it does

987
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:56,990
vaporize and it seems like it's a much

988
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:58,940
less violent reaction whereas as an

989
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:00,679
experiment again not a suggestion but as

990
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,769
an experiment if you wanted to just drop

991
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:05,089
like a drop of Turkey and on a 600

992
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:07,579
degree nail or something you would see

993
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:09,590
it dance around and then just poof off

994
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,059
and I think that that rapid expansion

995
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,170
would happen and that's what would lead

996
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:15,440
to somebody having a really poor

997
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,300
experience so most terpenes and not all

998
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,849
terpenes can be just inhaled directly I

999
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:23,060
really wouldn't suggest just going

1000
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:24,829
through a whole catalogue of them but in

1001
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:26,630
the case of what we did like I said it

1002
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,779
was just a very small amount alpha

1003
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,760
pining and you know the physical

1004
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:34,730
response is so dramatic afterwards just

1005
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,460
the you know you can definitely feel the

1006
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:40,429
ease of taking oxygen into your lungs

1007
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:43,519
and I think personally kind of a mental

1008
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:45,829
clarity or alertness it's like you know

1009
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,750
not necessarily the same thing as you

1010
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:49,009
know after your first dab of the day

1011
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,329
it's a little bit still

1012
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,820
been more clear than that it's a little

1013
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:55,090
bit lighter so very very positive I

1014
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,740
really hope to develop a product around

1015
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:59,300
alpha pining if we're able to you know

1016
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:03,019
go through the right channels as far as

1017
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,820
FDA approval basically for that sort of

1018
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:07,519
thing because just because something is

1019
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,890
grass rated or food safe doesn't mean

1020
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,929
that you can put it into a product and

1021
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:14,000
inhale it right on that makes sense and

1022
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:16,789
you know it's funny when you mentioned

1023
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,650
putting the putting the Terp right on a

1024
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,389
hot email or something and having a

1025
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,579
dance around well I definitely don't

1026
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:25,549
want to hit that because the potential

1027
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:27,710
terpene toxicity I do want to see that

1028
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,900
so I might I might do that at home just

1029
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,420
as a visual experiment and not actually

1030
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,760
hit it and you know um you know people

1031
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,260
are like you know how can I do this on

1032
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,680
the go you know there's there are these

1033
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:41,750
new portable dab rigs that are based on

1034
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,119
batteries and those seem to go really

1035
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:46,070
well actually the one I've got from uber

1036
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,259
technologies I just I put a little bit

1037
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,809
of terpene there on the nail and then I

1038
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:53,090
just let it start coming up to temp and

1039
00:40:50,809 --> 00:40:55,519
then as it comes up to temp I can hit it

1040
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:58,670
and man you know when you gave me the

1041
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:01,820
pining to try for the first time I was

1042
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:05,630
you know well I have asthma right and so

1043
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:09,559
the idea that my my my lungs opened up

1044
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:12,140
and I could breathe and I felt you know

1045
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:15,259
the power that comes from being in a

1046
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:16,759
forest right you know Ethan and I were

1047
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,350
talking about that you know take going

1048
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,050
out into the forest and taking a forest

1049
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:22,579
bath because it makes you feel you know

1050
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,410
it makes you feel like you want to throw

1051
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:26,150
your shoulders back and put your chin up

1052
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:28,250
and you are full power is it's amazing

1053
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:31,760
just like taking a little bit of pining

1054
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:33,170
will do that to you and and and so you

1055
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,140
know slowly I've worked my way through

1056
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,280
all that all the terpenes I have and you

1057
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:39,109
know you know there's a big difference

1058
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,120
between doing that with pining or mere

1059
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,450
scene or little they really do each have

1060
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,150
their own their own care caricature or

1061
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:48,829
character but the thing that I would I

1062
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,539
would say if somebody really was was

1063
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:52,940
interested in you know kind of figuring

1064
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:54,949
out which ones are of greater interest

1065
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,780
for that is look at a look at a terpene

1066
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:58,939
analysis and just look at the ratios

1067
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,860
that they're found naturally in the

1068
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,329
plant you know if you know alpha pining

1069
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,670
is found in pretty high levels near

1070
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:05,250
scene

1071
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,750
sound in pretty high levels but other

1072
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,179
terpenes like again I'll bring up

1073
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,949
geranium or maybe little much smaller

1074
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:12,000
quantities they're you know they're for

1075
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:15,359
the amount that's in there they're very

1076
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,789
potent but just kind of using that logic

1077
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,289
as a rule of thumb for how much you

1078
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:21,570
might want to consume if any one of them

1079
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:23,309
is led me pretty well all right

1080
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:25,500
fantastic so let's go and take another

1081
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:27,840
short break you are listening to shaping

1082
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,079
fire and my guest today is Ben Cassidy

1083
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,910
co-founder of true turbines businesses

1084
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,500
everywhere are constantly striving to

1085
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:36,569
reach out to people through advertising

1086
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,219
we all know though that trying to reach

1087
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,380
a cannabis audience with a quality

1088
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:42,089
message is pretty difficult that's why

1089
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:45,000
many people choose to advertise on the

1090
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:46,950
shaping fire podcast advertising on this

1091
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,019
show allows us time to talk about your

1092
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:50,819
product service or brand in a way that

1093
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:53,309
really lets people know what sets your

1094
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,110
company apart from others bold people

1095
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:56,610
who own companies know that getting in a

1096
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,730
relationship with their customers is

1097
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:01,920
essential that is what we offer we will

1098
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:04,380
explain your service or product and what

1099
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,599
sets it apart as desirable and help our

1100
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,700
audience get in contact with you it's

1101
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,509
pretty simple really

1102
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:12,509
advertising does not have to be all

1103
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:14,100
whiz-bang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

1104
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,800
find that people prefer just to be

1105
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:19,079
spoken to calmly accurately and with

1106
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,900
good intentions if you want to make your

1107
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,819
own commercial spot you can do that too

1108
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,950
because the podcast is young but growing

1109
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,080
in an exceptionally fast rate if you

1110
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:30,149
become an advertiser on the shaping fire

00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,320
fraction of the cost we'll be asking for

00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:36,569
in just a few months and yet everyone

about your company again and again for

1117

years it's a great deal for you pay a

1118
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,850

00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:09,089
this week has been Cassidy co-founder of

1128
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,390
Tru terpenes so you know then it's very

1129
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:14,519
common now for cannabis product

1130
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:16,109
developers to spike their products with

1131
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,590
terpenes you know they'll go ahead and

1132
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,480
process

1133
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:20,370
however they're going to but if they

1134
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,050
want it to be relaxing maybe they'll add

1135
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:24,119
some little little or mirror scene or if

1136
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:27,450
they want it to pick you up they'll add

1137
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:29,489
some you know commonly known as you know

1138
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:32,279
sativa terpenes like like citrine or

1139
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:34,919
something like that and you know I know

1140
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,300
you have got a lot to say about that

1141
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,920
and but why don't we want you to

1142
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,800
synthesize that a little bit down and

1143
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,590
and and just give us your thoughts for

1144
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,720
product developers you know on turf

1145
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,390
stability and degradation and homogenize

1146
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:49,049
ation and things like that okay yeah

1147
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:51,599
absolutely

1148
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:55,560
I think just like I had said before I

1149
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,480
think spiking with terpenes is it is an

1150
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,239
acceptable practice I just think there

1151
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,340
also should be you should disclose that

1152
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,169
you've done it that's what we encourage

1153
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,809
all of our clients to do we encourage

1154
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,940
them artwork from our company that they

1155
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:10,199
encourage them to co-brand with so that

1156
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,849
if they have questions that those

1157
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,429
questions can be directed to us so that

1158
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:16,949
we can properly answer them so I really

1159
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:18,299
think if you're getting into it it's

1160
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:19,859
just all about making sure that people

1161
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,539
know what they're consuming nobody wants

1162
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,180
to be surprised

1163
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:26,190
you know they later on so that's one of

1164
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:29,690
the most important things I think the

1165
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:32,670
ability to influence a product

1166
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:34,380
especially like I think I've had the

1167
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,340
greatest success with like with

1168
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:40,710
tinctures and topicals we have an

1169
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:43,440
incredible blend that we put into in

1170
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,970
call an indica blend tincture in the

1171
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,829
corrigan market same thing we have

1172
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:48,449
sativa they've been great and we

1173
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:51,110
wouldn't really be able to do it without

1174
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:54,869
the control of isolated terpenes because

1175
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:56,849
it's a standardized recipe from you know

1176
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:58,589
from batch to batch to batch everything

1177
00:45:56,849 --> 00:46:00,389
comes out identical so I think that

1178
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,829
that's a definite Pro if you're if

1179
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:04,529
you're working with products you know

1180
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:09,029
distillates or isolates isolated CBD or

1181
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:11,700
you know distilled THC are two very kind

1182
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,750
of more common cannabinoids that are

1183
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:14,519
that are definitely becoming

1184
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,139
commercially viable for people to use in

1185
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,000
making products combining those with

1186
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:20,750
terpenes so that you can control the

1187
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,630
outcome of the product is really

1188
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:27,110
rewarding and can be lucrative so what

1189
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:29,599
I'll say about the stability is that

1190
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:31,940
isolated terpenes

1191
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,610
I'm told by several of the people that

1192
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,769
we've consulted with from you know PhD

1193
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:40,880
chemistry world are much more stable

1194
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:42,949
because there's less chemistry basically

1195
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,200
able to happen within within the bottle

1196
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:48,859
of terpenes let's just say you had a

1197
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,569
cannabis derive profile of terpenes from

1198
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:52,970
you know from an OG Kush or something

1199
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:55,940
like that you might have 70 terpenes in

1200
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:58,459
there that are slowly degrading with

1201
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,559
with UV and with time and with you know

1202
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,470
if they're not you know kept at room

1203
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,509
temperature verse under some sort of

1204
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:07,189
colder conditions so they definitely

1205
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:09,650
have the opportunity to grade where when

1206
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:11,990
you have this isolated chemical you can

1207
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,750
more readily prepare for how it's going

1208
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:17,029
to degrade and you know you can put a

1209
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,769
shelf life on it but with these unknown

1210
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,510
solutions that are different from batch

1211
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:23,840
to batch if you if you're going with

1212
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:26,120
with a complex profile it's a little bit

1213
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,280
harder to do so isolated terpenes I'm

1214
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,159
told and you know from our experience

1215
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,540
are much more stable but all organic

1216
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:35,269
things degrades so it's just something

1217
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:38,869
to take into consideration as far as

1218
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:44,449
homogenous Asian you know it they

1219
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:46,009
terpenes are our non-polar so they need

1220
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:49,219
to MIT we need to make sure that they

1221
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:51,560
are mixed into the right carriers just

1222
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:54,559
about any oil or fat based carrier is

1223
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:57,739
going to work great the easiest I think

1224
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,869
healthiest that I'm aware of personally

1225
00:47:57,739 --> 00:48:01,849
as MCT MCT works really great with

1226
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:04,429
terpenes for somebody that's first

1227
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:07,429
getting into it right now I think making

1228
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:09,500
like a home-based MCT tincture with or

1229
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:12,109
without cannabinoids is a really good

1230
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,760
way to start experiencing these in a

1231
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:17,019
relatively safe manner as long as you're

1232
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,350
doing your research on concentrations

1233
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:23,030
and what I what I really encourage

1234
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:24,650
people to do when they're starting to

1235
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:27,110
get into product development with

1236
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:30,019
terpenes is walk before you crawl you

1237
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:32,660
know they're there's so many of them you

1238
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:36,559
know they say up to 200 at this time we

1239
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:38,149
offer 31 of them they're in it's about

1240
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,929
we're going to explain that even further

1241
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:43,579
but taking on so many different terpenes

1242
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:45,980
it really just gives you

1243
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:48,679
you know 31 more if you bought our whole

1244
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:50,659
set you'd have 31 more variables so I

1245
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:53,000
really encourage people to get used to

1246
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:54,349
kind of the core eight the the terpenes

1247
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,849
that are high it sound in the highest

1248
00:48:54,349 --> 00:49:00,920
quantities and kind of define unique

1249
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:02,750
branches of the cannabis family tree and

1250
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,320
just to briefly go through those that's

1251
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:10,840
alpha piney Lynne Ahlul Bayt Akari

1252
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:15,019
awfully eucalyptol lemony mere seem

1253
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:18,410
Turpin Helene in Turanian they all can

1254
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:20,989
be tied to common essential oils as well

1255
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:22,339
that most people are familiar with and I

1256
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:25,429
really encourage people to look into

1257
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:27,050
aromatherapy and find the waves that

1258
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,579
though the plants that contain these

1259
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,230
terpenes the way that they're essential

1260
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:31,849
oils are used naturally and then kind of

1261
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:33,800
start to mimic those you'll find some

1262
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:35,360
that are more prevalent in topical

1263
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,910
applications and others that are used

1264
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:41,180
and consumed orally or some that are

1265
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:43,849
never consumed but ru zombie Otley and

1266
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:45,589
inhaled through the air so I just really

1267
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:48,860
you know some for somebody getting into

1268
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:50,720
this it's not you know like like another

1269
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,460
book it's not in just a new form of

1270
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:53,989
cannabis extract where you can throw it

1271
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,820
on the nail and inhale it and you're

1272
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:58,159
just comparing the difference between a

1273
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:03,140
co2 oil and a BHO or something these are

1274
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:05,449
are definitely highly highly potent

1275
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:06,739
therapeutic compounds so I just I you

1276
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:09,289
know I always invite people to do their

1277
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:11,479
homework you know definitely pay for a

1278
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:13,039
consultation with with a company that

1279
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,679
works with these regularly or with an

1280
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:19,250
organic chemist to just get it get your

1281
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,230
get your bearings down because you know

1282
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:23,449
we for as much as everybody wants them

1283
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:25,010
to be therapeutic you know with that the

1284
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:26,539
other side of the coin is that they can

1285
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:29,810
you know they can have dramatic effects

1286
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:32,119
that you may or may not be so so

1287
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:33,799
satisfied with if Houston properly so

1288
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:35,389
right on well said you know one of the

1289
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,550
things that you know I've got a lot of

1290
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:40,159
respect for product developers I've

1291
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:42,920
dabbled in it myself mostly enough to

1292
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:45,199
realize how challenging it is it's one

1293
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,730
thing to to put something together that

1294
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,730
works right then and there but as soon

1295
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:53,179
as you add you know degradation

1296
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:55,340
homogenous Asian shelf stability and and

1297
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:56,989
some kind of product liability if the

1298
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:59,630
wrong kind of person get

1299
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:02,329
what you've made I realize what a craft

1300
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,099
product development is and I would and

1301
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:05,989
you know adding you know spiking with

1302
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:09,469
terpenes to it it adds a whole nother

1303
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:11,239
level to of you know artisan to the

1304
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:14,569
craft because I would say that people

1305
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:16,339
are who are our adding terpenes to their

1306
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:18,380
products the ones who are doing it

1307
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,930
really well aren't just spiking the hell

1308
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:23,000
out of one they're actually crafting you

1309
00:51:20,929 --> 00:51:25,940
know several of them together for a

1310
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,159
desired effect and and that is

1311
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,920
challenging just totally up and beyond

1312
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,960
what the rest of the the soda or the

1313
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,900
edible or the capsule is it's like a

1314
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,730
whole nother level of expertise

1315
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:41,150
absolutely and you know the other thing

1316
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:43,219
with with these being highly volatile

1317
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:45,440
meaning you know they evaporate easily

1318
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:48,819
being being very volatile scent

1319
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:52,280
molecules there also have a very strong

1320
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:54,650
flavor on the palate so you know in

1321
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,720
bringing them into a product it's not

1322
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,960
necessarily just as easy as you know

1323
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:01,250
taking your current existing recipe and

1324
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,460
adding some terpenes to it you know you

1325
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:06,530
the the entire recipe kind of needs to

1326
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,329
be analyzed to make sure not only that

1327
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:12,619
you're not going to ruin the flavor or

1328
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:14,420
grossly manipulate the flavor but that

1329
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:16,010
is not going to like you said kind of

1330
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,720
like the shelf stability side of things

1331
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:20,540
like three months down the road that

1332
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,399
it's not going to separate or that you

1333
00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:24,469
know some sort of discoloration or

1334
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,670
something along those lines happens so

1335
00:52:24,469 --> 00:52:29,059
it really is something to kind of

1336
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:30,800
integrate into a product and then you

1337
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:32,719
know we usually recommend that people

1338
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,510
give it like 8 to 12 weeks shelf

1339
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,549
stability test there are laboratories

1340
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:39,440
that you can work with within the within

1341
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:42,109
the food and cosmetic industries that

1342
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,269
can do some simulated testing to kind of

1343
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:46,250
help you get some more rapid feedback

1344
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:48,579
they can they can do about a week's

1345
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,409
worth of microbial testing and then

1346
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:53,239
build upon that a model that could kind

1347
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:55,099
of give you an idea but ultimately it's

1348
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:57,108
again it's it's kind of just like with

1349
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:59,299
any other new input you're going to need

1350
00:52:57,108 --> 00:53:00,619
to really put in your own R&amp;D we get a

1351
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,060
lot of people that will call us and

1352
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:04,220
really want the you know the Silver

1353
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:05,929

1354
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:07,399
shut right on you got to build the

1355
