1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,638
so Ethan you know um we're starting to

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,679
see Tarpin added into everything right

3
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:13,119
uh for better for worse um sometimes

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,440
they're just trying to make a product

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,399
taste a little bit better um and

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,000
sometimes they're actually adding tpin

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,079
like like oh we've added you know

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,679
citrine to this product it will make you

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,639
happy right um and then and then other

10
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,800
folks are just straight up adding Tarpin

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,240
to you know you know dabbable oils and

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,640
things like that so so there's a lot of

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,199
different implementations of tpin right

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,439
now and something that people ask me all

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:45,440
the time is at what point does a tpine

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:47,679
become um effective in the human body um

17
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,159
is there a threshold point where you

18
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,840
haven't had enough of the tarpine you

19
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,639
haven't had enough of the tarpine and

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,520
then at some point you're like oh this

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,320
is this is your threshold point where

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,079
you get the advantages of it and then

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,759
and then somewhere up here suddenly now

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,558
the tpine is doing less well for you

25
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,239
which you've talked about extensively

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,118
but this area to know when um a tpine

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,798
added to a product is actually giving me

28
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,599
any benefit how how would we weigh that

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,799
well uh it's difficult but uh good gauge

30
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:22,199
would be uh if someone finds a Cho ver

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,520
for which they like the effects say that

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,520
they're vaporizing uh kimar they like it

33
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:32,798
it might be a good thing uh to uh

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,039
extract ra uh to make an edible product

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,799
uh which would be particularly an

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,118
advantage for someone who had a chronic

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,600
condition where they wanted to uh be

38
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,399
able to dose effectively two or three

39
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,959
times a day as opposed to many times a

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,960
day if they were

41
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,759
vaporizing um part of the problem uh the

42
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:53,599
reason this has come about is there's

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,680
been a big move particularly in

44
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,038
Washington state towards

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,880
concentrates and in the state 60% of

46
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:06,200
sales now concentrates but um often

47
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,919
these are have developed an

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,080
imbalance um so

49
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:15,039
particularly uh with the CO2 extracts to

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,959
some degree as well uh with buttine

51
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,919
extracts which I don't particularly

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:24,239
recommend we're getting upwards of 70

53
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:28,000
even 90% THC to the exclusion of of

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,959
turpins and this is a real problem um

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,840
this is a situation where even

56
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,000
experienced cannabis user might take one

57
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,840
hit of a concentrate and pass out from

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,439
what's called orthostatic

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,800
hypotension uh just because it's a

60
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,959
slowed down there hard enough that they

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,879
can't get blood flow to the brain and

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,719
they hit the deck uh so that part's

63
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,199
dangerous but

64
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,800
additionally you've lost the turboid

65
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,919
because of the way that the material was

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,040
concentrated um and

67
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:02,518
processed but there are ways around this

68
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,919
concentrates rather should be made in a

69
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,519
way that preserves the terpenoids there

70
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:11,958
are two common ways to do this one is

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,640
with cold ethanol extraction and this

72
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,920
tends to get the terpenoids out at the

73
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,639
same time as the cannabinoids and and

74
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,359
preserve them so tinctures even though

75
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:27,759
they're oldfashioned remain a good way

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,239
to extract and to store cannabis uh

77
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,878
stably uh the other way uh is with CO2

78
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,599
extraction which is notorious for

79
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,479
causing a loss of terpenoids but instead

80
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:42,039
of doing one run that usually will get

81
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:45,280
the cannaboids effectively but lose a

82
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,359
lot of the terpenoids is to do one run

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,719
aimed at extracting each and then

84
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,879
combining them and there's nothing wrong

85
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:57,280
with this it just takes longer um but uh

86
00:03:53,878 --> 00:04:00,518
would be a better way uh to do this in

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,598
terms of the amounts um everything is

88
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,759
relative um there was one analysis of

89
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,919
things

90
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:11,840
that tried to demonstrate how potent

91
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,039
terpenoids are and indicated that uh a

92
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,560
concentration of

93
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,599
.1% uh can have a measurable effect but

94
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,040
it really didn't say how that was

95
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
administered so if we look at how

96
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,360
terpenoids are most effective certainly

97
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,199
they are on inhalation and I think most

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,199
people realize that there are also

99
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,560
effective when applied on the skin and

100
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,000
this is the ba basis of aromatherapy

101
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,519
massage um people shouldn't think that

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,639
this is witchcraft because you can

103
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,918
produce measurable levels of the

104
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,360
terpenoids in the serum after

105
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:52,079
application on the skin um they are

106
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,400
somewhat less effective orally uh but

107
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,680
that's not to say that there's no

108
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,519
benefit uh at all and so people

109
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,519
shouldn't shy away from that um

110
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:06,439
but um in general um we need to see

111
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:09,198
higher amounts of terpenoids in

112
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,800
cannabis-based medicines it would be

113
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,080
easy to exceed the necessary

114
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,560
concentrations if they're added from an

115
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,800
external Source MH you know I think that

116
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,439
um I think at the that the heart of this

117
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,038
is is customer and patient education

118
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:29,680
right because um the the market is

119
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:32,240
providing these um you know 70 80% ta

120
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,560
THC oils because when people are going

121
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,160
in they want the most bang for their

122
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,038
buck and so they they look for the

123
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,560
highest THC content not realizing that

124
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,240
as you're increasing your THC content

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,199
you're you're lessening the space

126
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,519
available for the minor canabo and the

127
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,520
Turpin and every and and especially CBD

128
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,680
which will help moderate and actually

129
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:54,240
make your THC High more pleasurable and

130
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,199
so um um you know what would what would

131
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,720
you recommend as far as you know trying

132
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,840
to uh I don't know backfill the market

133
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,840
to to to perhaps you know reach the

134
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,478
reach patients so that maybe the demand

135
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,439
changes so that what's being brought to

136
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:14,639
the market is changed sure well uh this

137
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,918
is a problem I've had this conversation

138
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:22,199
with many Bud tenders um and uh the

139
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:24,399
average consumer goes into a a cannabis

140
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,800
dispensary and usually ask for the

141
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:30,079
highest THC available a good bu Bud

142
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,478
tender will try to disabuse use them of

143
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,079
the notion that this is what they really

144
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,399
want um and try to explain that the

145
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,800
quality of their experience might be a

146
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:43,799
lot better with a more balanced

147
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,800
chovar um CBD has somewhat of a

148
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,680
reputation as a buzz kill uh but this

149
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,360
really isn't accurate either in the

150
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,879
olden days

151
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,720
um more often cannabis had a balance

152
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,360
between THC and

153
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,199
CBD um and and uh that was still

154
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,439
pleasurable for people in the

155
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,840
recreational Market um it takes a

156
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:12,598
tremendous amount of CBD usually given

157
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:15,839
before THC to totally eliminate uh its

158
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,598
ability to produce a high rather what it

159
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,359
will do when they they're used in

160
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,360
conjunction is it might blunt the Peak

161
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,240
High somewhat it also delays the onset

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,240
of the Peak High um and most importantly

163
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,280
prolongs the overall effect uh so that

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,639
people don't need to dose as often

165
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:38,359
whether they are using it recreationally

166
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,639
or to treat a specific disorder uh so

167
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,479
there're many advantages and then again

168
