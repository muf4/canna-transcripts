2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,920
the best farmers are connected to the

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,879
land physically emotionally and

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,080
spiritually the relationship is

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,719
incredibly intimate as the farmer tends

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,839
to the plants and the soil and the Earth

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,839
returns food fiber and flowers the

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,079
farmer integrates themselves into the

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:28,118
living system of the field and becomes

10
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,000
one with Nature's cycles and rhythms

11
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:31,640
this is the style of cannabis farming

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
that is the pride of the Emerald

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,200

between humble mesino and Trinity

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,800
counties it's the heart of America's

show uh I totally want you to talk a

48
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,560
little bit about where you live because

49
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,319
you know in the short time that we've

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
been getting to know each other um

51
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,239
you've been telling me about where you

52
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,000
live there in Northern California and it

53
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,919
just sounds like a totally amazing place

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,159
to will not only live but grow cannabis

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,118
will you just tell everybody about it a

56
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,159
little

57
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:14,159
bit okay um I live in what's known as a

58
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,318
banana belt region here in mesino

59
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,120
California in a town called lonville I

60
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:23,399
live at the bottom of a peak called kado

61
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Peak and uh our let me think four or

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,719
five of your past Emerald Cup winners

63
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,360
are my uh neighbors here in our

64
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,479
neighborhood and uh on the back side of

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,319
my property is probably a a one of the

66
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:41,439
most well-known uh Vineyards in the

67
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:43,000
region too and so um you know that many

68
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,519
great Emerald Cup winners are coming

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,719
from that area is it are people trying

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,400
to come there to grow because of the the

71
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,840
additional Sun that you get or is there

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,039
something special with the local soil or

73
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,400
or do you just get less um you know less

74
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,000
Mist so that's less likely to get mold I

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,080
mean what's the what's the magic there

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,360
well I think that 45 100 foot Peak

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,440
behind us the the onshore flow splits

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,200
and goes around us and so the

79
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:15,919
microclimate here is very unique and uh

80
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,919
that's what makes it possible to go grow

81
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:23,079
grapes in this area I imagine it would

82
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:25,000
be a great region also for uh you know

83
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,560
how like shade your own coffees and

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,438
things like that are preferred yeah I

85
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,158
think we have kind of the same type of

86
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:35,919
clim here and uh when I first moved here

87
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:39,318
the property above me it was um

88
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:42,280
dominated by the cartel grow and after

89
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:45,359
the landold had gotten in trouble a few

90
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,479
times they needed uh some uh people that

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,720
could move onto that that property and

92
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,438
you know exclude you know the cartel

93
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:57,158
from coming back that's where I brought

94
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:59,840
in uh I put are you familiar with uh Leo

95
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:03,479
stone from aici in a yeah totally Leo

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,200
and Jean yeah okay so Leo was working

97
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,560
for an old friend of mine and they their

98
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:11,359
partnership was just splitting up and

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,519
you know Leo was in the Army so I uh I

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,560
put Leo and another friend of mine that

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,040
was ex Special Forces on the property

102
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,439
above me and that's where a fishing was

103
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,360
born wow that's a great story I'm really

104
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,600
glad I asked and you know that there

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,160
there's something about having your grow

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,160
in this in this uh shadow of the

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,759
mountain or you know essentially being

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,960
protected by the mountain since the

109
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,038
mountain is splitting the clouds there's

110
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:39,159
a there's some romance in that yeah it's

111
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,639
I I don't know what I did to be so

112
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,960
blessed as to have the universe you know

113
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,800
let me have the property that I I'm

114
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,478
living on now but it it's a beautiful

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,960
place and I'm just honored to be here

116
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,360
right on fantastic so let's let's talk

117
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,239
some probiotics so you know we talk a

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,360
lot about probiotic growing on this show

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,639
but you know for a lot of Growers uh

120
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,560
still using bottled nut nut that term

121
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,199
may not actually mean anything I mean

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,000
they know that it's some kind of natural

123
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,759
growing but because they're so used to

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,519
using bottles and may not have done the

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,240
research yet they you know the term

126
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,319
doesn't mean much for them would you

127
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,918
explain the frustration that many

128
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,360
cannabis Growers have with bottled

129
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,079
nutrients and why a probiotic approach

130
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,439
is

131
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,879
different well one thing that many of us

132
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:28,560
realized is that because I mean most of

133
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,360
us I'm I'm not excluded I came from the

134
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,399
bottle background too

135
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,840
I I originally came here from Sacramento

136
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,719
and I worked for uh and with Dale and

137
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,038
Molly fry they taught me how to grow

138
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,520
with like Earth Juice but when I moved

139
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,680
up here you know I kind of fell in like

140
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,839
everyone else and started you know using

141
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,280
bottles cuz they were so easy to use and

142
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,038
the the appearance you know the bag

143
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,758
appeal was incredible you know what came

144
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,639
from some of like the original 321 mix

145
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,479
from General Hydroponics created some

146
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,840
incredible incredible crops you just had

147
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,038
to really have your your flesh game on

148
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,758
you know strong so that you know it

149
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:09,240
wasn't so noticeable that they were

150
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,520
grown with

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,960
synthetics after a while though you know

152
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:18,439
um especially if one has any kind of a

153
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,680
vision or anything like that it kind of

154
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:25,038
keeps you from from going that route any

155
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,759
longer I I'll tell you a story okay

156
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,839
um I come from the dairy industry I I

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,439
was in the dairy industry for roughly 2

158
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,679
years in the Sacramento Valley and up in

159
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:38,000
the Yakama Valley in Washington I I ran

160
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,759
my dad's subsidiary company up north and

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,680
uh one of my customers we were we we

162
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,360
covered silage pits they they say that

163
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,240
we were instrumental in you know um

164
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,360
getting the farmers to adopt solid state

165
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,519
fermentation with their their feed for

166
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,639
silage that's a fancy way to say we

167
00:06:54,519 --> 00:07:00,318
covered it and fermented it you know I

168
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,598
was working at this Mega Dairy

169
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:08,680
uh up in Washington state called the or

170
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:10,519
dairy and Henry or um he decided that he

171
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,319
wanted to have the runoff from our

172
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,719
fermenting of the silage pits uh go into

173
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,479
his manure

174
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Lagoon and what happened is instead of

175
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,399
the Manu Lagoon you know being the the

176
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,080
typical one with you know everything

177
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:27,359
Dead all around it his manure Lagoon was

178
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,279
it was starting to attract um you know

179
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,240
frogs Ducks things like that

180
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,439
and uh we the only thing we could figure

181
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,918
was that maybe it was because the the

182
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,719
runoff from using the lactic acids and

183
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,359
things to ferment the silage was in some

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,840
way bio remediating some of the toxins

185
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,598
in the manure lagoons that um you know

186
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,439
keep Wildlife from coming typically

187
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,399
around

188
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:57,158
them and we did some scientific testing

189
00:07:53,399 --> 00:08:00,000
and fairly quickly uh the or DA's uh his

190
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:02,079
manure Lagoon and his Dairy was no long

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,158
you know regarded as part of this toxic

192
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,560
super fun site that's where we kind of

193
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:09,680
developed you know way back I mean this

194
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,038
is like

195
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,478
1993 or 4 the theory of beneficial

196
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,279
runoff coming from these silage pits

197
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,240
that we were uh inoculating and

198
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,638
fermenting with lactic acid bacterias

199
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,840
and I I worked with some of the best um

200
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
nutritionists from UC Davis because

201
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,278
through fermentation we could make the

202
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,200
food more bioavailable for animals

203
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:38,918
also well we took in we used the same

204
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,680
Theory I I started working uh with uh

205
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,679
Reverend Eddy Le you know at the healing

206
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:47,239
Fields the the famous healing fields and

207
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,879
he wanted to buy this 40 acres and

208
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,080
across the highway from his main

209
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,519
facility and and grow the huge Garden

210
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,399
that everyone knows you know it was so

211
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,120
famous

212
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,639
now

213
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,159
and we he asked me Allan how do you

214
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,919
think we should irrigate it and I said

215
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,278
well you've got that Canal right there

216
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:05,479
that runs through the middle of the 40

217
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:08,720
acres and goes directly to Clear Lake

218
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,000
and he said yeah but if we do that then

219
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,480
you know we're going to get in trouble

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,480
with EPA from the runoff from the fields

221
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,000
I said well wait a minute let's let's go

222
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,680
back and use you know some of the

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,799
technology that I used in the dairy

224
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,479
industry and claim beneficial runoff and

225
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,719
then what we'll do is we'll test the

226
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,879
canal and prove you know uh that the

227
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,519
runoff from the crops uh was beneficial

228
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:36,480
to Clear Lake it proved out to be true

229
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,959
we we basically made um a 40 acre eban

230
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,159
flow that's pretty radical actually you

231
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,799
know I mean not only reputationally

232
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,199
since cannabis runoff has got such a bad

233
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,599
reputation and agricultural runoff

234
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,079
generally has got a bad reputation the

235
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,879
idea that your runoff could actually be

236
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,799
beneficial to the natural environment

237
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,200
and not throw it out of balance that's a

238
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,838
pretty radical thought well I mean not

239
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,839
only that um it we in my opinion proper

240
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:06,440
risk management right test your runoff

241
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,920
and prove scientifically that it's

242
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,839
beneficial for the local ecology and

243
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,240
that way if some State regulator or

244
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,360
someone wanted to come and pull your

245
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,159
licensing it would give you standing in

246
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,480
a court of law to to you know keep them

247
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,600
at arms length and keep your operation

248
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,480
running yeah that makes sense and I

249
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,600
think it's probably worthwhile to unpack

250
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,200
the idea of um the fermented materials

251
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,920
that you're were putting on top you know

252
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,320
essentially what you're doing

253
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:36,639
is you are adding uh microbial

254
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,160
communities to you know both the grow

255
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,959
and then the surrounding areas and so

256
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:44,838
instead of just pounding your your crops

257
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:47,638
with NPK that when it runs off it throws

258
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,959
nature out of balance instead of just

259
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,879
adding those you're actually adding the

260
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:56,439
you know the basic communities of life

261
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,838
and so when they run off your property

262
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,839
they're just help you know they're just

263
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,200
providing the basic community of life in

264
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,079
a different place exactly exactly

265
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,360
although I would add one thing to it you

266
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:10,599
don't want to just um add the microbes

267
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,879
you want to add the microbes and the

268
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,639
prebiotics that are necessarily to uh

269
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:18,720
while they're breeding you want to to

270
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,759
meet every epigenetic need that they

271
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,480
might have you want we want super

272
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,078
microbes so what kind of diet you know

273
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,560
what what what are these prebiotics that

274
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,439
you add that U you know gives them this

275
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:34,919
Buffet so that they can go Hog

276
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,639
Wild Well if you understand Oneness with

277
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,599
the soil and the microbes and you

278
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,278
understand that you yourself or you're

279
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,680
predominantly made of

280
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,439
microorganisms then I thought I'm going

281
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,399
to treat my fermentations and my

282
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,600
microbes the same way that a

283
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,839
naturopathic doctor would treat a a

284
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,720
female with a fertility

285
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,959
issue so when I make like our grow Kashi

286
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,759
product I I add a multivitamin mineral

287
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,599
comp complex and lots of other you know

288
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:07,200
like fresh Juiced uh beet juice and

289
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,959
things like that all organic and I

290
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,199
really go out of my way I treat my 300

291
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,239
lb fermentation Barrel nutritionally as

292
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:18,559
if it was a person and we were treating

293
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,879
that person for a fertility

294
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,879
issue that makes sense to me you're

295
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,679
you're you're creating a beneficial

296
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:29,240
environment for growth yeah and so if if

297
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,399
the prebiotics that we use in our in our

298
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,320
solid state fermentation aren't used up

299
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,519
during the

300
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,079
fermentation then they still are

301
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,839
basically in the toolbox of the microbes

302
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:44,679
to be handed out later

303
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,000
on yeah that makes sense to me so so

304
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,638
we're going to talk more about um the

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,240
particular fermentations that you prefer

306
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,240
in the second set but but before we wrap

307
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,519
up the first set here you know we

308
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,159
started by talking about the bottles and

309
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:03,720
the 321 and the like the really

310
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:05,799
beautiful um you know uh uh bag

311
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,680
beautiful flowers that you got with that

312
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,240
and then you said you shifted to the you

313
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,359
know the probiotics so I'm sure that

314
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,440
there's a lot of Growers who are

315
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,639
concerned that they'll have lesser

316
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,639
yields or that the flowers will have

317
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:21,440
less bag appeal from moving from bottled

318
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,278
nutrients to nutrient teas and such that

319
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,720
we're talking about today you know what

320
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,720
have you seen from others who have

321
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
gotten Brave and made the jump from what

322
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
they're you know they're comfortable

323
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,440
with in the bottle to something more

324
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,679
natural that we're talking about today

325
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,760
well first can I tell you that I didn't

326
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:40,120
just make the jump because of ecology

327
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,958
although that's a very strong point I

328
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:47,560
made the jump because um I was an

329
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:49,119
emerald cup judge and I was thinking

330
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,000
what in the

331
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,159
world is the difference in the winners

332
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,879
because I mean I'm pretty competitive

333
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:00,759
guy you know and so I was thinking that

334
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,360
it might mean nutrient density you know

335
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:03,720
because in wine that's the difference

336
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,440
between something that has you know

337
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,680
complex uh Aroma and taste is you know

338
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,399
High nutrient density is everything in

339
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:15,838
wine you know you know what a low

340
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:20,320
density uh uh low nutrient density wine

341
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,639
is called no I don't it's vinegar oh so

342
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,519
anyway I I said how can I test this I

343
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,360
called up a a company called natural

344
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,879
check and I talked to the CEO and he

345
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,399
actually owns theany too but he um he

346
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,198
said you know Alan I have been waiting

347
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,799
20 years for somebody from Cannabis to

348
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:40,278
call me and what I want to share with

349
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,838
you is that in my 20 years in the field

350
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:45,078
I've never

351
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,560
seen anything grown with synthetics

352
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,559
reach a high nutrient density level and

353
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,838
I said oh my God that's interesting I

354
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,479
have access to all of these entries from

355
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,480
the emerald cup what if we you and I

356
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,839
could figure out a way to uh

357
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,399
reconstitute the the herb and then I

358
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,639
could get uh use your refractor meter to

359
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,799
to get a bricks rating on it and he said

360
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,440
okay that's great we did that and what I

361
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:13,159
found is that all of our winners had a

362
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,519
very high nutrient density content

363
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,519
compared to the rest of the

364
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:22,799
contestants so they were they were super

365
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:25,719
packed with I mean life force for lack

366
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:30,078
of yeah they they had they had a way

367
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,120
more trace minerals in them than the the

368
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,758
you know the the plants that and the

369
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,399
entries that you know really uh never

370
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,680
stood out mhm so I thought huh well

371
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,278
what's H how how can I reach this

372
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:46,239
nutrient density level you know and well

373
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,838
it's through natural farming practices

374
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,159
through basically allowing the plant to

375
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,560
live in symbiosis with these mycelium

376
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,039
and these probiotic uh microorganisms in

377
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:01,399
the soil and so

378
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:03,599
uh you know fast forward a few years I'm

379
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,958
I'm working with uh

380
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,040
Eddie and well how do I say this without

381
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,239
sounding

382
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:13,599
crazy just go for it we're good with

383
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,600
crazy here okay so I'm working with I

384
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,959
knew Eddie for seven years and I hung

385
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,079
out and I watched people come and go and

386
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:25,879
Eddie had this famous poster on his

387
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,919
stairs that showed all the Illuminati

388
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:29,600
families and he was always like those

389
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,078
are the bad guys

390
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,720
and I was like yeah but Eddie you see

391
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,120
that Keller name right there I'm a

392
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,600
Keller I go we're no different than the

393
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,078
microbes you know those families 5% of

394
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,440
those families are good people because I

395
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,000
fully believe that we're no different

396
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,000
than the microbes we're made out of 5%

397
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,440
are you know roughly of us are uh

398
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,639
pathogenic so basically you know

399
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,880
sociopaths and Psychopaths 5% of us are

400
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,240
probiotic you know like uh people that

401
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:03,240
are more empathic and then 90% roughly

402
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,318
of us of our species are uh well they're

403
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,679
opportunistic just like the

404
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:10,678
microbes it's sad to say but I believe

405
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,559
this and so he said well what do you

406
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,480
mean I go well I'm a Keller look on your

407
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,119
thing there you're saying that all those

408
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,959
families and everyone in them are bad

409
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,399
and I'm saying you've known me for how

410
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,959
many years you do you really think that

411
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,360
you know I'm an evil person just because

412
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,558
I come from one of those families he

413
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,359
said no matter of fact I want to share

414
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:32,000
something with you I'm like okay goes be

415
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,319
back here next uh next week and and

416
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,640
people that are in the know know that at

417
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,439
Eddie's Farm um seasonally they had like

418
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,600
a tea

419
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,679
ceremony where it was like a a tea for a

420
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,159
Southwestern

421
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,960
Shaman you know mushrooms and such yeah

422
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,558
yeah and so I go I went back down there

423
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:56,679
and I'm a guy who uh I'm you know old

424
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:59,359
Bouncer and stuff I I had only smoked

425
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,600
pot and uh drank

426
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,399
alcohol I always steered clear of hard

427
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:08,359
drugs and I had never done mushrooms or

428
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,600
anything like that and so I brought uh I

429
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:11,479
brought my wife down with me because

430
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,839
Eddie wanted me to stay the night you

431
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,360
know and do this tea tea ceremony at

432
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:19,359
midnight and I also was a guy who had

433
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,359
built you know three three companies

434
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:25,558
previous to getting into you know the

435
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:28,199
Cannabis game and so I did that you know

436
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,240
with like Tony Robbins using his

437
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,038
programs and so I know that if you're

438
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,400
going to go meet someone important you

439
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,960
know the very best way that you could

440
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,320
honor them is to try to uh come up with

441
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,120
a great question for them that you think

442
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,319
they might want to

443
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,479
answer well I don't know you know I

444
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,960
guess if you're going to do mushrooms

445
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,839
and have a mushroom tea maybe you're

446
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,400
trying to meet God or something or

447
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:51,279
nature and so earlier in the day my

448
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,000
brother who was doing great with these

449
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:57,519
sub irrigated Planters these Earth boxes

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,640
he said um Allan I I think uh he's

451
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,319
pretty intuitive my brother he said I

452
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,759
think these uh Earth boxes have

453
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,960
something to do with like the technology

454
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,038
behind the Hanging Gardens of

455
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,840
Babylon so I go down there and I'm going

456
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,038
to go to this tea ceremony and my wife

457
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,199
and I go upstairs to go to sleep we come

458
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:16,839
back down do the Tea Ceremony go back up

459
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,600
to go to sleep you know at about 1:00

460
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:22,319
and I wrote down on a piece of paper uh

461
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:26,399
how did the Hanging Gardens of Babylon

462
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:29,119
operate and I fell asleep to what looked

463
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,240
like um a stack of different color

464
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:34,119
moving back and forth and I just had

465
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,679
this weird the the first of all it was

466
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:39,319
like a mission it was like if you should

467
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:43,798
accept this Mission you know and okay

468
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:47,399
I'm down uh and I had this dream and it

469
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:48,918
was like you know how uh in a computer

470
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,200
when you put a zip Drive in like

471
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,520
nothing's there and you put the Zip

472
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,640
drive in and it's all there mhm and I

473
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,440
kind of saw I didn't kind of saw I got

474
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,400
like the the business plan on on how

475
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,519
those Gardens operated and how they used

476
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,440
solid state fermentations cuz those

477
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,879
people in those times were the kings of

478
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,759
fermentation and how they used um these

479
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,200
sub irrigated Planters but the sub

480
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,679
irrigated planter really represented a

481
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,600
gut and what you did is there was like a

482
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,759
fairly soilless medium in the bottom you

483
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:22,240
built a melal mat on top of it then you

484
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,200
put your manure on top of that but then

485
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,679
they they covered it with a skin so that

486
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,679
the mycelium and the things that are

487
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,200
normally light pruned are no longer

488
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,798
light pruned and so that because they

489
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,200
were in a desert region the thing used

490
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,918
about a third of the water that any

491
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,640
other type of farming would use it took

492
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:43,200
me two years to talk myself into trying

493
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,960
it but when I when I did try it it it

494
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,720
not only worked but it worked

495
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,440
exceptionally well and so we started uh

496
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,079
Eddie was in prison about that time and

497
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,000
we started doing a methodology patent

498
00:20:53,079 --> 00:21:00,279
for what it meant to be probiotic

499
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,240
farmed and um

500
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:05,038
let's see where I can go from

501
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,798
there we were working with a a patent

502
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,400
attorney down in the Bay Area who um

503
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,759
apparently talked to some friends about

504
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,679
the work we were doing and the next

505
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:18,798
thing you'd know we had uh some people

506
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,640
from the alcohol in and tobacco industry

507
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,000
contacting us and they were all friendly

508
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,240
at first they wanted cuz we were doing

509
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,839
this patent methodology patent in the

510
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,319
name of humanity because you know you

511
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:33,959
don't want like information like that to

512
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,038
be taken and shelf

513
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,000
away and so they contacted us and they

514
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,000
wanted to give us like $5 million for

515
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,200
Eddie's likeness and All rights to

516
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,640
prootic farmed in the methodology patent

517
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,558
um but they would not in any way

518
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,520
guarantee that they wouldn't shelf the

519
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:55,879
technology oh wow so we told them no and

520
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,400
then all of a sudden they started

521
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,278
mentioning some friends of ours that

522
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,679
were in um free energy that had had um

523
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,159
gag orders and things placed upon

524
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,720
them and they were kind of threatening

525
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,120
that they could not only place a gag

526
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,200
order on us somehow but they could make

527
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:15,359
Eddie's time in prison rougher I mean at

528
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,278
first they're like yeah sign with us we

529
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,879
we could put the legal team on and maybe

530
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:20,839
even get Eddie out of prison a little

531
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,600
early yeah they changed their tune at

532
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,278
this point no matter of fact they just

533
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,759
became dicks about

534
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:31,880
it and so I called Eddie and Eddie said

535
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:33,359
um Allan I want you if you're down go up

536
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,799
to because I was headed to the emerald

537
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:41,278
cup that day and he said make it public

538
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:42,119
knowledge um Tim allowed me to uh do a

539
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,278
quick

540
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,158
workshop and I just taught everyone

541
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,720
everything we knew right then and

542
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,600
there wow that's a that's a very

543
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,278
fortunate thing I mean not only for

544
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,038
everybody who was there and for the

545
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:58,319
ideas behind the tech but gez I mean

546
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:59,919
that could have gotten bottled up from

547
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,839
that point forward that was a pretty

548
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,360
brave move just to decide to tell

549
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,759
everybody all at once and uh and get

550
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:08,119
that information out

551
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,240
there yeah we had some plants that were

552
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,918
grown there's some videos that you saw

553
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,200
on Discovery Channel where um Tim Blake

554
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,240
was walking through one of his green

555
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,558
houses and he was petting this one plant

556
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,798
in the middle of the

557
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:21,399
greenhouse that's the plant that that I

558
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,918
planted that

559
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,200

00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,158
is Alan adinon founder of the probiotic

00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:59,640
Farmers Alliance on Facebook and Gro

604
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,880
Kashi so before the break we were

605
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,038
talking about you know the history of

606
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,960
probiotic growing coming to the Cannabis

607
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:10,519
world and and how you essentially made

608
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,640
that information you know open source at

609
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,679
at an emerald cup but one thing I want

610
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,759
to hit before we go into what you know

611
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,840
some of your preferential uh nutrient

612
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:20,240
fermentations are is you know there's a

613
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:23,398
lot of people who are going to be

614
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,079
weighing using synthetic nutrients to

615
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:28,558
get really bag worthy you know you know

616
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:31,240
flowers with really great bag appeal

617
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,480
versus going the probiotic route which

618
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,839
takes a little bit more effort and um

619
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,440
and you never really like locked down

620
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,839
about the flower itself why you think

621
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,679
it's better than the synthetic stuff so

622
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,639
so if you if you'd hit that for me

623
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,720
before we move on I'd appreciate that oh

624
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:55,399
sure okay it's my opinion that when you

625
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,200
let a melal mat dictate the delivery how

626
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:58,719
how much nutrients and exactly what

627
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,880
nutrients and Trac minerals are

628
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,759
delivered to the plant that's when you

629
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,559
can achieve these these very high

630
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,919
nutrient density levels I think that

631
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:09,000
some people they fall victim when they

632
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,799
first try to go organic and they don't

633
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,759
understand that it's going to take your

634
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,200
soil one two sometimes maybe three crops

635
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,278
to get up to its full

636
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,679
potential by the time your second or

637
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:22,278
third people in noil know this you know

638
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,320
but by the time your soil gets up to its

639
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:26,278
second or third crop that's when you

640
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,879
really start competing heavily with the

641
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:32,440
same yields that we would have attained

642
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,960
from uh our our bottled crops now I will

643
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,200
say this um when I first started doing

644
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,919
this to get traction with people um we

645
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,440
called it anerobic hydroponics through

646
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,480
probiotics and I put on a series that

647
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,159
you can find if you go into the

648
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,599
probiotic Farmers Alliance and you type

649
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,080
in dep on a dime I showed people uh

650
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,119
every day I said okay here's what we're

651
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,359
going to do we're going to show you

652
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:59,519
every day what we did on the

653
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:02,558
crop and uh we were able to

654
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,398
uh grow a crop of the syx we had some

655
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,639
other plants but synx was mainly what I

656
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:09,119
was working with because it had been

657
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,240
heavily tested by uh SC labs and other

658
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:14,798
labs so we knew what to expect from it

659
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,599
when we grew it out using our probiotic

660
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,440
methodology or what we call probiotic

661
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:23,599
farmed with the sips it it set new

662
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,480
records for tpin and to this day now

663
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,480
that was around a year and a half ago

664
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,278
and one of the top clubs up here is

665
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,120
owned by Tim Blake and it's the healing

666
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:36,038
Harvest Farms Club um we we've held the

667
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:39,599
uh the top price point for a year and a

668
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:42,720
half with the the synx from that crop

669
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:47,558
that we grew in front of everybody so I

670
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,079
wanted to um alleviate people's fears

671
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:51,960
that they would not be able to compete

672
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,398
you know if they took this

673
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,480
route right on that's that's what I was

674
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,678
looking for and so um you know is the is

675
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,240
the bag of feel the same like visually

676
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,399
cuz like sometimes when describing um

677
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,759
you know uh uh synthetic and indoor

678
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,359
versus probiotic and outdoor it feels

679
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,079
like you know they they both produce

680
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:15,240
decent flowers but but the the indoor

681
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,278
synthetic stuff is kind of like like

682
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,759
looks like an Olympian and sometimes

683
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:25,398
looks a little strange because it's

684
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:27,919
so um grown in a super uh un

685
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:29,839
unnatural um artificial kind of way but

686
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,519
the product you get is still amazing and

687
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,879
wins insane Awards and is enjoyable to

688
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,599
smoke um but then but then you got the

689
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,720
other kind of folks like think of maybe

690
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,959
like a high school cross country Runner

691
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,159
also super fit but they run on country

692
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,240
roads and you know they're obviously a

693
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,880
fit person but they um you know they're

694
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,919
they're a little more natural right and

695
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,640
so they're these are both incredible

696
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,038
athletes but they they they appear

697
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,840
differently does the probiotic stuff you

698
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,398
know even when it smells good does it

699
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,639
still have the Toleration that you get

700
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:04,359
with um with synthetics or do you give

701
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,759
up a little bit of that for a nose and a

702
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:10,199
taste that'll blow everybody

703
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,720
away no we surpass the synthetics right

704
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,720
on but you know one of the one of the

705
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,839
statements that we made early on um is

706
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,399
the the truth is in the

707
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,199
smoke now in our community one of the

708
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,359
cool things about our community is I

709
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,000
don't care who is in the smoking Circle

710
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:31,519
I I could be standing there with Kyle or

711
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,359
Ed or you know rest Soul Jack or Eddie

712
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:37,000
any of these people and we're not like

713
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:39,079
uh typical wine snobs if some new if

714
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,119
some kid walks up to our circle and has

715
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,960
an herb that'll blow our mind that's

716
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,518
what's cool about cannabis you know a

717
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,440
lot of people in our industry talk the

718
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,200
talk but if you can show up with herb

719
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,600
that blows people's minds that's walking

720
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,679
the walk yeah you know and it's not just

721
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,959
you know I I was able to be successful

722
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,159
you know doing that but now with like

723
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,798
the PFA we're coming up on 20,000

724
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:05,399
members there and there are people that

725
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:08,679
are actually using our logo uh growing

726
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:10,639
probiotic to uh establish themselves in

727
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,399
their local markets because people are

728
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,159
looking you know they're going around at

729
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,798
the clubs looking and asking okay where

730
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,480
can I get robotically fired materials

731
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,240
and when we say the proof is in the

732
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,960
smoke if it wasn't they would call

733
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,679
[ __ ] on us and they would have a

734
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:30,360
long time ago yeah that makes sense and

735
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,519
you know I if if I saw a fa logo um on

736
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,439
somebody's grow I would be attracted to

737
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,679
that I mean in a way it's a it's kind of

738
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,159
like a seal of approval um the things

739
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,278
that I've learned and let's be real

740
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,960
clear the probiotic Farmers Alliance is

741
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:45,798
a group on Facebook um about you know

742
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,720
20,000 people strong um where everybody

743
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:50,440
is discussing in detail um these

744
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,839
techniques that were we're merely

745
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,038
skimming the surface up today so so

746
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:56,678
that's where I got turned on to

747
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,919
probiotics and and and and met Allen

748
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,559
luckily um so anyway you should check

749
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,200
that out if you're into this topic that

750
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,839
we're talking about today but but your

751
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,399
logo itself the the purple triangle if I

752
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:08,199
saw that on somebody's grow I would

753
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,278
immediately be into that stuff because I

754
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,240
know that it's grown in a way that I you

755
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,880
know that I aspire to grow better at and

756
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,399
it probably tastes great and I know that

757
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,039
it's not going to have any garbage in it

758
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,199
right and even the logo you know the

759
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:25,158
group designed the logo the group

760
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,319
started as just beta testers I took 25

761
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,960
testers um and when you say that I'm the

762
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,720
founder of PFA that's technically I I'm

763
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,038
a

764
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,759
co-founder um Michael Fong people know

765
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:39,798
him as uh m4k uh at Gage green I was

766
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:43,359
working with them at the time and and he

767
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:46,240
and I started it with uh the 25 first

768
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,439
people in what's now the PFA they they

769
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,558
were from the gug green testers MH and

770
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,679
uh when when we were done beta testing

771
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,918
we had 3 or 400 members members by then

772
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,000
of gashi cuz we had the members help us

773
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,559
formulate it we wanted to know of the

774
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,079
top Growers what what would you want in

775
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,319
your Bashi if you were going to have a

776
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,678
dream

777
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:08,558
Bashi so he helped me form that and and

778
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:10,600
that's where it all

779
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:11,759
started right on cool well thank you for

780
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:14,678
clarifying that I always like to have

781
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,558
the oral history to be straight so so

782
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:19,240
hey so we've got about um oh about four

783
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:21,319
or five minutes here before our next

784
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,720
break um and I'd love to have you

785
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:25,558
describe how to make you know I know

786
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,079
there's lots of different nutrient tees

787
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:31,079
that can be that can be made would you

788
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,558
just give a a simple recipe um that

789
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:36,439
people can start with um so that they

790
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:39,079
can you know find see what it's like to

791
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,639
make their own fermentation and Tre

792
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:42,359
treat their plants with it so that that

793
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:44,479
you know so we have like a a place to

794
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:46,918
start for people and then hopefully they

795
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,679
get excited by the results and then they

796
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,639
you know they start researching more and

797
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,240
join the probiotic Barbers Alliance so

798
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:53,839
so give us something simple that people

799
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,839
can start

800
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,759
with it depends on what's local in their

801
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,558
region I mean if you

802
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,879
had these skills can really be looked at

803
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,720
as um a survival skill what would I do

804
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,039
if I only had horse manure or what would

805
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,679
I do if I only had rabbit manure or

806
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:14,679
llama or alpaca you know I you would

807
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,038
make a tea out of it and and basically

808
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,759
make a beverage that you're going to

809
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:21,839
feed to the Earth you'd use a one

810
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:25,158
problem with

811
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,439
um manties and things like that

812
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:31,760
is there there could be a pathogen

813
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:34,320
hiding in it so we depend on competitive

814
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,000
uh exclusion to out compete those

815
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,398
pathogens by using our favorite

816
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,638
probiotics which is like the lactic

817
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:44,599
acids and the lactic acid

818
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:46,759
bacterias so you know look and find

819
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:50,480
what's what's around you like Jack har

820
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:54,119
wanted me to use um sugar sources from

821
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,759
different uh crops grown locally around

822
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:58,000
Clear Lake at the time too for

823
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,599
biodiversity you know sometimes we had

824
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,679
plums available to us and all this but

825
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,398
later on we decided to use beets because

826
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,200
I mean a beet is a sugar source that

827
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:09,838
basically Grows Right in the myal layer

828
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,679
and so I also thought uh I wanted to

829
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,078
make sure that the streptomyces was in

830
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,039
our Bashi so I knew it was going to be

831
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,359
in the wheat because I use a menonite

832
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:20,878
grown organic uh hard red winter wheat

833
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:23,838
brand but then as a backup because my

834
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:26,279
theory is one you know one is two is two

835
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,358
is one one is none so I knew that if I

836
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,560
Ed the Beet and the wheat I'm going to

837
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:33,039
make sure that I have plenty of imos and

838
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,878
especially the streptomyces in it and

839
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,719
that streptomyces and the lab are going

840
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,078
to out compete any pathogens that might

841
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,918
be hiding in uh other components that

842
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:45,039
you can find to put in your

843
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,719
tea so to so to break this down even

844
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,878
more basic so are you saying that you

845
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,118
take you take a you know five gallon

846
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:55,078
bucket and cut up some beets and um put

847
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:58,280
your your hard winter wheat in there and

848
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,920
and fill it with water and put a in it

849
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,359
and let it sit for 3 days and let it

850
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,320
start to ferment I mean is it is it that

851
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:07,920
simple no I put it all in my solid state

852
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,920
fermentation

853
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,440
first and then after that I can take my

854
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,280
solid state fermentation and put it in a

855
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,880
in a bucket and I really wouldn't use a

856
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,119
a bubbler because these are these are

857
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,800
more Anor robic microorganism it was it

858
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,440
would be like if you were making a beer

859
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,000
or a kabas you wouldn't use a bubbler I

860
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,960
understand now and when you say when you

861
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,960
say solid state is that more of what I

862
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,800
think of like traditional compost like

863
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,000
just meaning no no added liquids just

864
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,119
mix no there there's added liquids but

865
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,119
it's at roughly a 60% moisture

866
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,079
content so you mix it up until it's good

867
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,920
and wet you know

868
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,440
but a A good rule of thumb would be when

869
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,760
you make your solid state fermentation

870
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,079
add fluid until you can just barely

871
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,680
squeeze some drops of water out of it I

872
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,318
mean it was the same indicator that we

873
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:00,480
used for silage when when I was working

874
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:01,880
with the the nutritionists from Davis

875
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,400
they would tell me Allan check the

876
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,920
silage while they're bringing it in from

877
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,760
the fields and and let me know if you

878
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,800
can squeeze water and it rolls down your

879
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,119
wrist your wrist call me because I'll

880
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,720
have the truck stop harvesting the crop

881
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,000
from the

882
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:20,239
field I see so so I would um so you mix

883
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,239
the beets and you mix the wheat and you

884
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,118
add just a little bit of fluid and you

885
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,519
get it all turned up and you just let it

886
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:30,160
sit how long would you let that sit and

887
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:33,519
ferment before you go ahead and and put

888
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:36,239
it into um water to make your

889
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:39,239
tea you know with a solid state

890
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:42,118
fermentation uh the best way to tell if

891
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:45,479
it's done is uh wait for the pressure to

892
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,680
stop number one and then number two when

893
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,159
you take that material add water let it

894
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,879
sit overnight and your pH goes to four

895
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,358
or just under four you know that you've

896
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,960
had a successful fermentation mhm would

897
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:59,119
you break out that part you said um you

898
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,519
fermented till stops what what exactly

899
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,559
do you mean by

900
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:04,519
that well you know when you're making a

901
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,199
fermentation like beer or anything else

902
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:09,039
like that you know the pressure that is

903
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:11,639
that is the the off gassing that occurs

904
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,440
yeah wait for the off gassing that is

905
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:17,199
occurring to stop I

906
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,920
see one way is that I mean in the old

907
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,439
days I used to put a balloon on the

908
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,880
barrel you know on a Barb and it would

909
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,358
blow up the balloon and then when the

910
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,160
balloon stopped blowing up and it

911
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,199
contracted I would know the fermentation

912
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:31,960
was compl complete nowadays I I just you

913
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:34,719
know I know in these food grade barrels

914
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,838
how many days it takes me so I don't I

915
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,318
don't have to you know do that research

916
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:42,358
anymore yeah right on and when I when I

917
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:44,920
make um you know uh sauerkraut and stuff

918
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,358
I use a plug on the top of my Carboy

919
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,079
that uh you know it's it's an scurve and

920
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,799
it's got water in it so I can tell that

921
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,560
there's bubbles going through it so you

922
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,960
just throw one of those on top and then

923
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,078
when when that stops giving off gases

924
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,240
you know that you're you're good to put

925
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,200
it in some water so when you do you just

926
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:02,679
immediately put it in water mix it up

927
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,159
and put it on the plants because I would

928
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:07,960
think that going from the dry uh state

929
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,039
to be in the in the water state if you

930
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,960
don't use it right away um that you're

931
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:13,639
going to choke off the microbes that are

932
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,679
living in

933
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:19,400
there yeah um what you want to do at

934
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:23,078
that point is dry it and then you can

935
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,119
store it you know like you've got these

936
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,440
how how did Joseph make the wheat stay

937
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,640
good for seven years for the pharaoh he

938
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,358
fermented it and then he dried it and

939
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,318
then they put it away that's what we do

940
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:36,159
with this

941
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:37,759
stuff I see and so so once it's on the

942
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,118
Shelf when you want to reactivate it and

943
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,119
put it on your crops do you take it out

944
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,079
and just put it you know mix it right

945
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,519
into your soil or are you making even

946
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,240
even bothering to make a tea out of it

947
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:51,000
at that point well what we want to do is

948
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:54,879
have a multi-purpose product and so we

949
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,199
could uh if we make a tea out of it then

950
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,760
um we can apply it foliarly but if we

951
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,199
apply it you know as the tea we're we're

952
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,040
not really putting down the trace

953
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:07,118
minerals onto the soil surface so we you

954
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:11,358
could go both routes make a tea out of

955
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,960
some of it and then go in and broadcast

956
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,679
your bokashi onto the soil surface

957
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,199
roughly every 10 days to two weeks

958
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:21,199
depending on how big the plant is

959
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:24,799
because we're not just giving the the

960
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:26,759
plant and the the soil the probotics

961
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,079
that it needs we're giving it the

962
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,119
probotics that need it needs and the

963
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,519
prebiotics you know the food for the

964
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:38,079
microbes to keep the microbes happy and

965
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:41,239
very uh active if we if we can keep the

966
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,960
like the streptomyces In Bloom and we

967
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:48,358
can see it growing then we know that uh

968
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,159
it is both making the plant's immune

969
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,679
system and the soil's immune system

970
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,480
everything that it can be at its Zenith

971
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:57,838
and also the the photosynthesis will

972
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,559
occur at the highest rate possible

973
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,519
right on I follow you so before before

974
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:05,799
we go to break I just want to say that

975
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:08,159
you know there is a you know hopefully

976
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,318
at this point we have gotten folks

977
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,759
excited about okay that there's

978
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,719
alternatives to the bottle that you can

979
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,640
create these you know these Ultra Rich

980
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:22,000
um uh microb communities and mycelium

981
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,679
communities in your substrate and they

982

984
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,800
you a cycle or two or three to get your

985
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:32,838

1005
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,800
Kashi using pesticides when growing

1006
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,039
cannabis has been common for a long time

1007
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,280
nowadays though we know better we know

1008
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:19,920
that most pesticides formulated for food

1009
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,160
crops have never been tested for use

1010
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,559
with cannabis they've been tested to be

1011
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,799
eaten in tiny doses they have not been

1012
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,480
tested to be inhaled and especially not

1013
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,280
concentrated ated into a cannabis oil

1014
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,079
chemical residues from pesticides are

1015
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,480
not healthy for anyone but they are

1016
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,160
especially dangerous for patients for

1017
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,480
commercial cannabis Growers this has

1018
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:41,318
become very impactful cannabis

1019
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,880
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

1020
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:46,838
educated enough that they avoid Growers

1021
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,440
who used pesticides not only that but

1022
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,039
States across the country have begun

1023
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,280
making pesticide testing mandatory on

1024
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,800
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

1025
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,839
come to find a better way to fight

1026
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,480
Garden pests than covering your cannabis

1027
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:04,318
and chemicals and there is a better way

1028
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,480
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

1029

know I know that you uh your life's work

1059
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,880
as far as probiotics go was the

1060
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,359
development and the releasing of gashi

1061
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,200
which is you know your own special blend

1062
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:29,799
of bokashi and you know I had never

1063
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,199
heard of Bashi before I joined the

1064
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,280
probiotic Farmers Alliance to learn

1065
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,919
about it so why don't you take a moment

1066
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,480
and kind of explain what it is and how

1067
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,400
it works to kind of bring people up to

1068
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,159
speed cuz you know I know when I first

1069
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,838
when I used it for the first time after

1070
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:45,318
you gave me a sample of at Emerald cup I

1071
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,039
I freaked out a little bit because like

1072
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:49,119
all this stuff I had never seen happen

1073
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,480
in my soil you know all this out of

1074
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,640
control mycelium and unidentified

1075
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,960
microbes and colorful but beneficial

1076
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:57,118
molds it was very strange so why don't

1077
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,358
you go ahead and just talk a little

1078
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,318
little bit about what Bashi is uh from a

1079
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:04,358
probiotic level and we'll kind of just

1080
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,880
take it from

1081
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:08,880
there okay the Bashi would be a

1082
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,640
supplement that you add to your soil you

1083
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,760
know so that you could take advant

1084
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,598
advantage of competitive exclusion out

1085
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,280
on the crops in the

1086
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:20,318
fields in Roman times you know it was

1087
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,200
used um you know how you had the

1088
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:25,679
different deities one of the deities in

1089
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:29,039
Roman times one of the Gods was called

1090
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:30,919
lacus and tus was in you know we know it

1091
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,759
as lactic acid bacteria but it was in

1092
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,880
charge of the safeguarding and the

1093
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,800
storage of

1094
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,640
crops um the other one the streptomyces

1095
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,160
melum we're talking about I'm still

1096
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,078
looking for more links so that I can

1097
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:49,358
really nail this down but um it was

1098
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:51,280
known as uh St Anthony's snow and

1099
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,759
everyone knows about St Anthony's fire

1100
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,839
you know what I mean it's ergotism and

1101
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,280
things like that and it it gets into the

1102
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,719
joints of people well the cure for St

1103
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,640
Anthony fire was this St Anthony snow

1104
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:05,959
this actinomyces

1105
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,799
streptomyces and what we know is that uh

1106
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,039
when all the wheat back in those days

1107
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,720
was put put away you know there was a

1108
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:15,039
labor force that had to uh ferment it

1109
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,039
and put it away and one of the reasons

1110
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:21,920
why it it was done by hand is that as

1111
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:23,599
these Roman soldiers were returning what

1112
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,760
let me say this to you when you create a

1113
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,640
soldier you must create a psychopath

1114
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,040
because that Soldier has to be able to

1115
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:34,078
kill to reindo that Soldier into society

1116
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:37,159
what you need is some sort of an

1117
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,280
empathogen you have to reinstall empathy

1118
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:43,159
in into that Soldier and that's why they

1119
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,800
would have had this work done uh By Hand

1120
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:47,279
by these soldiers that were having

1121
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,359
problems that were coming back the you

1122
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,640
know direct exposure to the hands and

1123
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:52,920
the feet with the lactic acid bacteria

1124
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:56,440
and by the way we can go to Google

1125
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,440
Scholar and look this up and find that U

1126
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,599
PTS treatments there are they are

1127
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,720
scientifically valid uh PTSD treatments

1128
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,760
that include these these probiotics that

1129
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,838
we're talking about especially lactic

1130
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,800
acid

1131
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:13,239
bacteria it it reinstalls empathy in

1132
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,640
people wow so my thought is well let's

1133
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:17,519
do the same thing I I will get myself a

1134
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,960
a I'll surround myself with with

1135
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:24,079
veterans that you know have have had or

1136
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:28,039
still have PTSD and uh have them make

1137
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,760
these products and watch the out come

1138
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:33,960
and what I've watched is a a real

1139
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,040
turnaround in a lot of these guys so I'm

1140
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,599
I've worked with uh small business

1141
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:40,759
administration and will continue to to

1142
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:43,440
uh provide therapy to these to these

1143
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:47,119
guys through their involvement in in

1144
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,440
this bokashi or gashi making it's also

1145
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,358
nice because um you know we're we're

1146
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,079
always looking with the veterans to

1147
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,558
provide retraining when they come back

1148
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:00,400
so working in solid state fermentation

1149
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:03,359
Tech Technologies is a that's a great uh

1150
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,720
Avenue for them to go you know into yeah

1151
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,078
and you're getting these these these

1152
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:10,598
folks who are you know skilled and

1153
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,640
really good at project management and

1154
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:14,519
and getting things done and you're

1155
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,838
you're teaching them how to use those

1156
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:18,318
skills in a way that's you know good for

1157
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:20,679
the Neighbors good for the neighborhood

1158
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:23,719
good for the environment what an amazing

1159
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:26,960
retraining program and um just the idea

1160
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:29,799
that them working with the the the the

1161
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,000
labs and probably handling the soil with

1162
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:35,000
their hands as well the fact that that's

1163
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,880
all healing them and and regrowing

1164
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,519
empathy in them I mean that's really

1165
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,079
profound I didn't actually know you were

1166
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:42,719
going like that far with this and that

1167
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,880
that's that's pretty heavy duty stuff

1168
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,399
I've never heard that before I I want to

1169
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,960
I want to share some news that I got

1170
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,480
just this last week now one of my I'm

1171
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,960
folding the grok Kashi company in and

1172
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,920
grok Kashi is going to be a product

1173
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,358
under the plant candy label uh plant

1174
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,159
candy also uh we'll have liquidates that

1175
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,960
are revolutionary because our partners

1176
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,879
hold like 170 patents in the gold mining

1177
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,440
industry and one of the problems with

1178
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,880
liquid humates is is heavy metal content

1179
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,920
so when we run these these humates

1180
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,559
through gold mining equipment we can

1181
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,559
pull out most of the heavy metals and

1182
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,319
get them out of the

1183
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,319
way now what's cool is that one of my

1184
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:25,759
partners has a direct Avenue with four

1185
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:28,079
of the largest oil companies right now

1186
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,079
so imagine if you

1187
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,119
oil

1188
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:32,640
pipelines you know they're they're prone

1189
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,800
to rupture it

1190
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,519
happens so if we found the average

1191
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:42,160
amount of oil that was spilled from one

1192
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:43,759
of these uh and we know that like Bashi

1193
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:47,440
have been used Ian bokashi have been

1194
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,359
used like on on the Exxon bdes uh or no

1195
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,559
I think it was the Costco Busan here in

1196
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,960
the the Bay Area to clean up oil so if

1197
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,319
we figure out the the amount of oil

1198
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,440
that's regularly spilled and we have the

1199
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:01,798
veterans make uh that much bokashi you

1200
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,798
know three times the amount of the

1201
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:06,960
average spill and have it on site then

1202
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:08,599
it provides retraining for the veterans

1203
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,960
but we're getting great involvement with

1204
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:13,400
the oil companies

1205
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,199
because wherever the rupture

1206
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,880
occurs we go there and we will train the

1207
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,558
veterans and have the veterans in that

1208
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,358
area make the the grok Kashi for the

1209
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,040
next oil spill so the area that was

1210
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:27,119
ecologically

1211
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,838
impacted they're also going to get

1212
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,798
funding in the form of you know those

1213
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:35,279
veterans in that area are hired and

1214
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:37,559
retrained to make the Bashi uh for the

1215
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,798
next oil spill cleanup so if it was

1216
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,119
10,000 barrels that they spilled we're

1217
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:43,119
going to make 30,000 barrels of Bashi In

1218
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,680
that

1219
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,720
region and so it's it's

1220
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:52,239
um you're you're adding to the local

1221
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:55,639
economy too yeah absolutely and and and

1222
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,318
getting training for those local vets we

1223
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,838
we found a way with these corporate

1224
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:01,480
sponsors you know uh I pray it goes

1225
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,519
through the way we we hope it does but

1226
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,679
it looks it looks like it it is going to

1227
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:07,920
become a reality that we're going to be

1228
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,239
able to open up shop wherever these oil

1229
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,440
spills

1230
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:15,239
occur yeah it feels very much like a um

1231
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,519
a kind of a Johnny Apple seat as the as

1232
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:20,318
the environmental blight happens you're

1233
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:23,358
suddenly coming in and teaching the

1234
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,318
local vets how to um make Rashi which

1235
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,639
then fixes the environment and also

1236
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:29,440
creates new local business and retrains

1237
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:32,199
the vet it sounds like it's a win-win

1238
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,720
winwin like everybody involved gets a

1239
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:38,838
win exactly it's it I hate to be uh too

1240
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,558
simple at it but or stating it but it's

1241
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:42,880
like threatening them with a good time

1242
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,000
because it's it's the best public

1243
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,559
relations that they could ask

1244
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,159
for right on so hey I really appreciate

1245
