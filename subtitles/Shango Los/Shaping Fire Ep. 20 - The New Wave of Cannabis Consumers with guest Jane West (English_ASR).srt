2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:09,899
the media loves to soon about the rapid

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,089
growth of the cannabis industry in fact

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,769
the latest estimates are that by 2020

5
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:15,179
the cannabis industry will have revenue

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,460
of forty four billion dollars a year

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,079
that's on par with the entire gross

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,750
domestic product of the country of

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,729
Panama the market will swell as more and

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,259
more states legalize and new marijuana

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,689
products are developed to respond to

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,820
that demand those of us who have been

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,099
cannabis enthusiasts for decades have

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,649
had access for a long time to the casual

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,929
unlicensed market we enjoy cannabis and

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,460
use it to heal ourselves now though

17
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,530
we're beginning to experience a change

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,628
like has never occurred in cannabis

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,399
before we've reached a tipping point

20
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,259
where new folks are getting turned on to

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,840
cannabis who may never have used it

22
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,308
before some are coming by way of medical

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,199
marijuana because they are seeking

24
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,539
natural relief without the side effects

25
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,429
of pharmaceuticals some are looking for

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,350
an alternative to alcohol for partying

27
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,269
because even though we like it alcohol

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,730
is still a poison and cannabis is much

29
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,618
safer than alcohol while others simply

30
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,420
were always cannabis tokers who just

31
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,430
didn't know it yet now that they have

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,868
legal access to marijuana have tried it

33
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,670
they have fallen in love with the

34
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,920
creativity and good feelings that come

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,170
with it it is these people who are the

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,700
future of cannabis they will vote for it

37
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,710
with their ballot and they will vote for

38
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,450
it with their cash and nothing moves

39
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,789
mountains in America like cash does

40
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,650

new cannabis consumers entering the

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,780
market now and how cannabis product

67
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,340
developers can create innovative

68
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,430
approaches to meeting their needs

69
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,879
welcome to the show Jane oh thank you so

70
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,460
much for having me so so you first began

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,349
cultivating this this new market of

72
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,780
cannabis enthusiasts through your series

73
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,819
called edible events and the events were

74
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,129
you know more upscale than nearly any

75
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,259
other cannabis events and they included

76
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,359
fine art and classical music and they're

77
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,789
held at times that you know worked for

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,650
folks who had kids at home did you find

79
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:49,139
that the folks who came out to these

80
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,550
events were were already integrated into

81
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,069
the cannabis scene or were they

82
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,160
primarily cannabis curious folks who had

83
00:02:53,069 --> 00:03:00,859
found a home and an event that that that

84
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:05,789
you put on and spoke to them um so in

85
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,890
2014 I scheduled out 12 edible events

86
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:11,519
one for each month and we were actually

87
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:14,189
able to produce seven of them before the

88
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,790
city just basically shut it down so each

89
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:20,789
one each event there were more and more

90
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:22,650
people who were newbies and who were

91
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:24,419
cannabis curious the first the first

92
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,000
couple events were were almost pure

93
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,708
cannabis industry people people that

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,139
were in the cannabis industry or people

95
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,240
that were looking to get into it by the

96
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,399
second event I had already been featured

97
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,409
in a few different news stories so

98
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,080
people wanted to come to the event not

99
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,449
only to be part of it but also to meet

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,430
all the different sponsors and contacts

101
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,609
that were there so that was definitely a

102
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,349
component the beginning but as the

103
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,890
events continued to happen on a regular

104
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:55,079
basis and especially after our

105
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,689
partnership formed with the Colorado

106
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,440
Symphony Orchestra we really started to

107
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,959
bring in a new group of consumers who

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,000
were very curious about incorporating

109
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,620
cannabis into their lives so at the

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,830
beginning was your goal originally to to

111
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,680
bring in the the cannabis industry folks

112
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,299
first or was your goal originally to

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,579
bring in the newbies because of course

114
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:23,399
with this show our goal is to hopefully

115
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,109
inspire people in other cities to do the

116
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,409
similar thing so who is your original

117
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,129
target

118
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:34,090
um honestly my original target was me

119
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:37,990
this is I am a regular cannabis consumer

120
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:39,789
and I absolutely prefer canvas alcohol

121
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,460
as like my substance of choice on a

122
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:46,060
Friday night and I simply wanted to

123
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:48,549
create a really high-end event with

124
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,990
great food and wonderful music in an art

125
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,720
gallery that I would wear a cocktail

126
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,689
dress to on a Friday night and also be

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,120
able to openly consume cannabis there

128
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,990
and so as a result in order to

129
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,629
accomplish that goal

130
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:06,129
I needed both sides of that group I

131
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:07,290
needed the cannabis companies who I was

132
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,969
also providing them a great opportunity

133
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,710
to showcase their brands especially with

134
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,230
all the advertising limitations we have

135
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:16,899
in this space and I wanted to learn more

136
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,210
about all their products I mean up until

137
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:21,729
the day of legalization adult youth

138
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:24,060
legalization on January 1st 2014 in

139
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,879
Colorado I really it was only a flower

140
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,530
consumer and so I wanted to learn more

141
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,779
about all these incredible infused

142
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,689
products on the market as well so they

143
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,129
really became like a great place for

144
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,829
consumer education about new products

145
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:41,259
coming out and then it was a safe

146
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:43,810
welcoming location like right in the

147
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:45,668
heart of the Santa Fe Arts District that

148
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,780
you could go attend a cannabis event

149
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:52,299
which absolutely normalized that as I

150
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:54,969
was building the event series I went to

151
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,000
several events that were advertised as

152
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,220
cannabis events just to kind of see what

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,750
was happening in the market and most of

154
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,470
them were like wood they were not real

155
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:10,240
organized they were in locations that

156
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:13,390
were not like central to Denver and they

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,310
the ones I did attend were not the scene

158
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:18,459
that I really wanted to be part of and

159
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,740
didn't reflect my cannabis experience so

160
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:22,539
you were saying that the as you did more

161
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,759
of these events more of these these

162
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,470
crossover new folks came and got

163
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,449
involved how do you think that they

164
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,390
found out about it because you know

165
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,668
people who are not into cannabis don't

166
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,829
necessarily read all of the cannabis

167
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:38,079
things so were you putting some kind of

168
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,668
copy out there or through the press to

169
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,949
let them know that this event was for

170
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:43,279
them

171
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:47,360
I mean I did my very best to build a

172
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:49,669
straightforward webpage of each one of

173
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,699
the events and I listed off all of the

174
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:55,970
menus and I really also tried to feature

175
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,709
all utilize the network of everyone we

176
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,310
were showcasing at the event to promote

177
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:03,469
the event so for instance we were in one

178
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,509
of the best art galleries in Santa Fe at

179
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,040
Space Gallery and we would talk about

180
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,439
the different artists that we're

181
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,090
showcasing there and at each one of the

182
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,920
events there'd be some like special

183
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,299
activities so we we would talk in

184
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,390
advance about how you can come watch

185
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,759
this particular like body painter or

186
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,209
this woman that was skilled in origami

187
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,689
different things depending on the event

188
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:28,729
but you know candidly the very the most

189
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,129
important thing I did to promote the

190
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,980
events was to just keep my message solid

191
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,219
with every single media interview there

192
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,939
had the opportunity to take at the time

193
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:44,270
I invited a lot of like smaller media

194
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:45,800
companies and even guest bloggers who

195
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:48,829
were really interested in the space and

196
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,259
we're so wanted to attend and so I would

197
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:53,599
always have a pretty large medium PR

198
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,579
list and take extra time to talk to each

199
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,879
one of them when they were at the events

200
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:59,959
so I could really make sure that they

201
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,290
understood what we're trying to create

202
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:06,109
here and could share a message often

203
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,120
when anything is taboo that it went off

204
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,650
to anything that is taboo first comes in

205
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,930
the mainstream you know there's usually

206
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:13,669
lots of giggling about it right so do

207
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,560
you find that these new crossover

208
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,750
cannabis enthusiasts have to spend a

209
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,550
little time you know working out the

210
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,709
fact that they're doing something that

211
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,199
until recently had to be underground and

212
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,269
instead was now only illegal federally

213
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,879
but essentially it was okay for them to

214
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:34,340
be at the party um yes I absolutely do

215
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,549
for the cannabis curious I in my opinion

216
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:40,490
the first step is the most important one

217
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,109
like they have to decide that they're

218
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,120
interested enough to go into the

219
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,330
dispensary and see what products are

220
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,799
there for them but after that very first

221
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:53,700
step they see this whole world of

222
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,419
different products and

223
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,370
and like for instance in Colorado

224
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:01,379
records in Colorado but there's so many

225
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,320
different high quality products that

226
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:05,759
have in all different uptake systems and

227
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,030
there's chocolates and mints and

228
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,759
tinctures and patches and bass pens and

229
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,079
and as you're looking at the products

230
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,600
and evaluating them you realize that

231
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,700
this is not what you thought it was and

232
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,159
you know these are high quality products

233
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,080
being made by companies that have been

234
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,600
in space for a long period of time and

235
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,310
and you you learn that as you learn

236
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,720
about all the different brands and so

237
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:30,659
once you've taken that first step

238
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,759
through the door the dispensary you

239
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,039
really your eyes are opened up to all

240
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:38,399
the things that this can be and then

241
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:41,219
just curiosity takes over and so that

242
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,209
seems to be kind of the standard newbie

243
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,850
path in Colorado at least that the idea

244
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,250
of sparking their curiosity is a great

245
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,420
goal and the idea of taboo let's talk

246
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,639
about for yourself for a moment I know

247
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:56,279
you promoted these parties originally

248
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,870
under the pseudonym Jayne West and that

249
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,569
the ink on the new canvas laws were

250
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,639
barely dry at this point did you create

251
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,560
your pseudonym of Jayne West to keep

252
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,629
your cannabis life separate from your

253
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,129
day job or was the idea intentionally

254
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:10,259
from the beginning to start breathing

255
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:17,189
life into a lifestyle brand called Jayne

256
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:20,240
West so at the very heart of it the idea

257
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:24,210
was to intentionally recreate my

258
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,970
professional life so there were a lot of

259
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:30,930
different reasons behind that but I

260
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:33,120
wanted to recreate what I was doing

261
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:37,039
professionally in this world and what I

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,350
was spending my time creating and so

263
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,699
there were a lot of reasons to to use a

264
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,350
pseudonym at the time especially because

265
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,379
I didn't know a single person in the

266
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,450
industry and and and and I wasn't sure

267
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,799
what I was going to do with my more

268
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:55,860
corporate job if this started to work

269
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:59,339
but honestly there's I mean it just made

270
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,080
it a lot administrative Liese err to

271
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,210
start a new business I've never done

272
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,600
anything like that before

273
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,050
I'm 40 years old and well you know when

274
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,389
I

275
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,309
growing up I definitely had the mindset

276
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:14,850
that I was going to go to college and

277
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:17,278
then get a job and get a great job or do

278
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,920
a great job but I didn't really know any

279
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,139
like entrepreneurs like no one in my

280
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:27,028
world is like hashtagging startup life

281
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:28,799
like and so I was really you know

282
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:30,870
setting out to do something that I had

283
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:35,599
never done before and kind of had to

284
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:38,759
step into this whole new bolder persona

285
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,220
and so every step of the way I've just

286
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,439
tried my best to make really intentional

287
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,899
decisions to create what I want to see

288
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,360
in the world and so part of that was

289
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:50,250
started with recreating myself if that

290
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,860
makes sense yeah that makes sense and

291
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,389
also you know from from the from the

292
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,759
that I've talked about you and from what

293
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:59,338
I've read you know you definitely sound

294
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,769
like a wonderful host and part of being

295
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,240
a good host involves creating a space

296
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,399
where your guests you know feel

297
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,870
comfortable clearly the environments

298
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,539
that you built were you know pleasant to

299
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,120
be in but did you find that you played a

300
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,949
role kind of therapist to in many cases

301
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,379
to like like fluttering amongst the

302
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:19,070
guests and helping them give themselves

303
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,450
permission to be at a cannabis party oh

304
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,940
definitely definitely I was always at

305
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,709
the front actually I have my master's

306
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,020
degree in social work so I've always

307
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,389
been a fairly good networker and

308
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,240
especially those initial introductions

309
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,899
of people at all the events you know we

310
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,659
had a very welcoming introduction so we

311
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,570
always had a front table very friendly

312
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:45,110
host that would kind of ask people that

313
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,540
was the first time and walk them through

314
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,759
you know where everything is and and so

315
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:52,289
really it's about just being welcoming

316
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,259
and open and answering people caught

317
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:58,319
people's questions in that our third

318
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,600
event meet so hungry we had this whole

319
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
like origami station and the next the

320
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,329
origami station we had a giant rolling

321
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,889
station and just kind of like candidly

322
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,328
being like okay how do you do this how

323
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:12,059
would you roll joint pull out your

324
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:13,500
papers let's um but you know first we

325
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,448
are going to grind up our cannabis and

326
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,839
then you roll up the filter and and it

327
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:20,399
was great and by not making it like too

328
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,900
cool for school

329
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,389
you already know how to really join man

330
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,250
like and just being open like okay let's

331
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,919
see let's try it out go see if you can

332
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,350
learn how to do it it kind of broke down

333
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,449
those barriers and like demystified

334
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,090
people thoughts about what the event

335
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:38,220
would even be to begin with and I think

336
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,470
a lot of times in the beginning there

337
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,060
was a lot of conversations about the

338
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:48,660
events itself which helped spur more

339
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,429
conversations about cannabis so it was a

340
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,589
topic of conversation that you were even

341
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,359
there especially by like the third and

342
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,649
fourth event when we had people from

343
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,730
like twelve different states

344
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:02,669
flying in for the events so it just

345
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:05,250
became like a really fun super social

346
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:07,709
setting of like-minded people that all

347
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,330
thought you know this is the place they

348
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,940
want to be on Friday night and it made

349
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,100
for a great group I really like your

350
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,260
approach of not making it too cool for

351
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,750
school right because so much of our

352
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,220
industry is very elitist and everybody's

353
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,559
trying to get farther and farther out

354
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,980
over the edge but you brought it all the

355
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:28,439
way back to hey let's have fun and make

356
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,289
this ultra simple so that we can be very

357
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,120
inclusive and I really like that um

358
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:35,250
there's still some risk in participating

359
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,990
especially for you know the folks that

360
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,149
you were appealing to that we're less

361
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,269
than counterculture how do you suggest

362
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,340
that newcomers to cannabis way the

363
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,470
aspect that they could still get fired

364
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,899
for having cannabis in their system or

365
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,660
if they saw somebody from work I'm sure

366
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,209
that some people vocalize their concern

367
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,289
about being outed and so I'd love to

368
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,420
hear before we go to the first

369
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:59,759
commercial what you kind of told them

370
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,319
from your from your therapist role on

371
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,169
how to get over that or make that

372
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,120
decision for themselves right so so

373
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:08,099
first of all no matter what you have to

374
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,399
like evaluate what your drug policy is

375
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,340
at work and and make those decisions for

376
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,019
yourself so separate of possibly like

377
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,580
being released from your job for

378
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:21,870
consuming cannabis which is an important

379
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:24,660
topic we should talk about at my is what

380
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:27,899
we had to make a decision or at every

381
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:30,299
single event regarding filming and so

382
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,949
this is how this really was what mainly

383
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:37,069
pushed this topic among guests because

384
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,840
I could have not allowed filming and

385
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,780
every single one of the events so we I

386
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,910
mean the reason the name edible events

387
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:46,189
company and and Jane West and everything

388
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,860
we're doing is know if so is known so

389
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,230
far and why is because so many media

390
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,789
partners were allowed to attend all of

391
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,710
the events and were allowed to film all

392
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:56,929
the events and that was the decision

393
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,780
that I made early on and it definitely

394
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:02,299
affected attendance of the of the events

395
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:04,610
because there were so many people at

396
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:08,209
that time and still today who would not

397
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,550
be comfortable being at a cannabis

398
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,730
consumption event and being filmed or

399
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:18,169
photographed consuming which I

400
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:22,490
understand however at the same time it's

401
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:25,990
kind of a catch-22 because until we have

402
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,909
more mainstream consumption occurring

403
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,799
there won't be the visuals out there

404
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:32,899
that this is normal

405
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,259
everyone's doing this your neighbor

406
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:39,709
tries it your mom tries it you know it's

407
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:41,600
okay and it's going to be part of you

408
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,960
know our legal lifestyles of the future

409
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,269
but unless we film it and unless we like

410
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,350
capture these moments and take lots of

411
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,419
the pictures of the party and show

412
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:56,440
people what it looks like and demystify

413
00:16:50,419 --> 00:17:00,169
that so um so we done so we allowed for

414
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,840
filming at all of the events and as a

415
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:05,269
result there's great imagery of all of

416
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,578
our incredibly classy symphony events

417
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:09,170
and and our brunches and all the other

418
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:14,419
things we've done that really keep

419
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:16,579
putting this like you know positive look

420
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,190
on what we're doing here and showing

421
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,899
people that that this is this is totally

422
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,180
this is normal and you should come to

423
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,370
the events and you should you it's a

424
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,440
great place to try new products and meet

425
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,789
new people and start to learn how to

426
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,650
incorporate cannabis into your life

427
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:33,349
whether you use cannabis at that

428
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,930
particular event or not I think a lot of

429
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:38,059
people bought a ticket and for their

430
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,490
first one they just kind of came to see

431
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,929
what it would be like and then came to

432
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,720
future events and all the symphony

433
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,019
events because they decided that they

434
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,690
want to be part of it and they wanted to

435
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,369
- well I applaud your approach because

436
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,190
you know a lot of people who aren't

437
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:55,169
involved with the the creation of

438
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,600
normalization think that normalization

439
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,009
is just about the law changing and

440
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,079
really that's that's just the beginning

441
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:03,960
of normalization the normalization is

442
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,269
when people start feeling safe to

443
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,880
discuss their cannabis use and go out

444
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:11,639
and use and and use it socially and not

445
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,980
be afraid to be outed and that's exactly

446
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,000
the approach that you went for we're

447
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,620
going to go ahead and take a short break

448

492

cannabis find out about the events

sup to the million dollar question right

498
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:08,308
which is for the folks who chose to use

499
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,590
cannabis at their first events you know

500
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:12,388
how did they handle that because you

501
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:14,428
know as we know with people who are new

502
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:17,128
to cannabis sometimes they can over

503
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:19,048
imbibe and dosing us a constant

504
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:20,939
challenge for newbies how did you

505
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:22,798
prepare your guests for a good

506
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,798
experience and not becoming

507
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:29,339
overmedicated well here in Colorado

508
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:31,200
there's a really great alliance that is

509
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,298
formed among all the enthused product

510
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,399
manufacturers and they work closely with

511
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:38,038
the Colorado Department of Health to

512
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:41,459
create an entire campaign around start

513
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,798
low go slow and so that was very useful

514
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,819
because they created you know third

515
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:50,219
party materials that that helped inform

516
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:51,598
new consumers that were part you know

517
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:54,088
the government was part of making them

518
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:56,608
with us and so that helps us just keep

519
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:58,739
the message Universal among all about

520
00:20:56,608 --> 00:21:01,228
tenders and among tourists of Colorado

521
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:03,119
start low go slow and then there's

522
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:05,778
backup information behind that it

523
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:10,168
basically was the good to know campaign

524
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:13,259
which I love and so so we always kind of

525
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:16,080
keep to that mantra additionally we are

526
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,210
at the event for sewing now you go to

527
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,288
the dispensary and you acquire a goodie

528
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,119
bag of all of the this variety of

529
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:26,158
products and so there's information

530
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:28,348
about each of the products inside of

531
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,749
there and then you choose you know it

532
00:21:28,348 --> 00:21:33,088
was BYOC like you choose what you're

533
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:35,159
consuming and how over the course of the

534
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:37,138
night based on all that information and

535
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,419
it's great because we're so familiar

536
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:41,699
with each one of the products in the bag

537
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:43,288
that we can provide you know inquisitive

538
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,889
guests with supplemental information

539
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:49,288
about what they're consuming and we we

540
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:54,148
tend to stick with more low dose items

541
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:56,848
to begin with you know I think I I have

542
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:59,428
to say in this particular category in

543
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:01,588
terms of having a good experience I

544
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:03,479
think it's really important that for

545
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:06,479
your first couple cannabis experiences

546
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:08,970
you don't involve alcohol at all and I

547
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:10,220
don't see that happening as often as I

548
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,730
should

549
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:18,169
there's I think you'll find that the

550
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:20,808
majority of negative first couple first

551
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:24,139
or second experiences that people may or

552
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:27,500
may not have they also were consuming a

553
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:29,928
notable amount of alcohol and so I hope

554
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,609
that newbies and would suggest that they

555
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,230
prepare it like we're used to having

556
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:35,178
always having a beverage in our hand in

557
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,429
this country especially in like a

558
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,980
recreational setting so you know pack

559
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:42,850
yourself some Lacroix or a nice like

560
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,710
refreshing iced coffee stay hydrated

561
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:47,778
with non-alcoholic beverages and really

562
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,750
just focus on enjoying the cannabis

563
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:53,298
experience that's really solid advice

564
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,069
and so often when people go to a

565
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:57,109
cannabis event as a newbie and they

566
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:58,700
notice that there's a bar they go to the

567
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,928
bar first so they can get the drink in

568
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,940
their hand so that they feel comfortable

569
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:04,070
and that's when they start consuming and

570
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,798
now suddenly they're double dipping and

571
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:09,980
they're not having the proper cannabis

572
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:13,970
experience okay so that so my biggest

573
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,399
happy are the stories that go this this

574
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,379
persons night started they decided not

575
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:20,538
that they didn't want to consume an

576
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:23,689
infused product they started drinking

577
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:26,839
and then decided yeah I might as well

578
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,298
try it and then like they're already not

579
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:32,000
set up for success you just should you

580
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:34,429
really focus on experiencing the

581
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,220
cannabis in a singular form and and

582
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:39,048
really making the most of it and seeing

583
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,970
how the effects of it on your body and

584
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:43,908
what you really enjoy about it and

585
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,909
focusing on that and is really like is

586
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:49,659
my best advice to people and that's

587
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:53,210
really important too for people who are

588
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:55,070
bringing in new cannabis enthusiasts

589
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,230
because a lot of folks if they don't

590
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:59,089
have a good first experience they're

591
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,308
probably not going to be back and we

592
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:03,740
really do want them back because we want

593
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:05,658
to we want to push normalization but

594
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,819
also you know most media is writing

595
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:10,639
about present cannabis users and

596
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:12,918
cultures and I think that the new users

597
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:14,928
who are learning about cannabis for the

598
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:17,360
first time are really about to be

599
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:19,340
influential these cross over canvas

600
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,500
enthusiasts will comprise the biggest

601
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:23,599
market cannabis has ever seen and they

602
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,210
come to the market with a much no

603
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,369
wider range of motivations and simply

604
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,798
getting high you know what are some of

605
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:33,529
the most common motivators you hear from

606
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:37,269
your guests and new customers about why

607
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:43,099
they've come to cannabis hmm

608
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:47,990
you know I think the core of most new

609
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:52,819
users reasoning is happiness and

610
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:55,190
whatever that means like for a lot of

611
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:58,788
women in my demographic that's getting a

612
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,529
good night's sleep and and how much how

613
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:04,400
important that is to their overall

614
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:05,960
well-being and happiness for others that

615
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,509
are starting to use it a bit more

616
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,029
recognition early as they're like

617
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:13,308
spending all day cleaning their houses

618
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:16,038
and and are kind of like incorporating

619
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:18,019
it into their lives and seeing different

620
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:21,890
ways that it can help them in their yoga

621
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:23,569
practice and in other ways that is you

622
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,370
know bringing them more happiness I

623
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:31,308
think you know women in my demographic

624
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:33,798
between the ages of 35 and 55 consume

625
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:36,079
more mind-altering drugs on a daily

626
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,650
basis than any other group of Americans

627
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,178
through antidepressants and anti-anxiety

628
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,580
medications and so and what we're doing

629
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:47,538
there is you know taking a drug seeking

630
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:50,720
happiness calm in our thoughts and so I

631
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:53,720
think a lot of women are going to find

632
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,480
cannabis as a healthy substitute to some

633
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,190
of those substances as well so at the

634
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,150
end of the day I feel like the most

635
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:04,880
common motivators is seeking seeking

636
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:07,400
some more happiness in their lives it's

637
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,010
certainly not uncommon for me to hear

638
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,330
from you know new cannabis enthusiasts

639
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:13,879
that for them

640
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:16,250
cannabis especially like low-dose

641
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,750
edibles or a tincture is the new mommy's

642
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,579
little helper right I mean I've heard so

643
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,960
many times that you know it's the main

644
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:25,339
reason I don't kill my kids you know or

645
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,120
your husband right no absolutely

646
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:31,038
absolutely I mean I mean this we have a

647
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,928
right in this country to life liberty

648
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,230
and the pursuit of happiness

649
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:37,298
and so um definitely something you can

650
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,278
find within

651
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:40,538
my mom it's one of the reasons why I

652
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,548
think that you know essentially

653
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:45,128
everybody's a patient because even air

654
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:48,038
quotes recreational news or users are

655
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:51,609
still looking for anti-anxiety anti

656
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:52,989
stress increase quality of life I also

657
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:56,079
think that these newcomers are a

658
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:58,058
powerful force as a consumer market and

659
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,638
they'll very quickly become an

660
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:02,048
emboldened political bloc as well you

661
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:04,628
know a political bloc who will also

662
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:06,398
likely be more affected in you know

663
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:08,230
communicating with the legislature

664
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:11,079
because they look and they speak more

665
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,899
like their legislators instead of much

666
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,730
of the heritage cannabis Lobby that

667
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:17,918
shared so little in common with the

668
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,889
politicians they are lobbying do you

669
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,929
think that the new cannabis enthusiasts

670
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:25,209
are quick to get involved in the

671
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:28,149
activism aspects or are they still too

672
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:31,960
far from that being new to the scene um

673
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:34,988
I certainly hope so we absolutely need

674
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,829
their help on every level so I hope it

675
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:40,329
makes people more active politically

676
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:42,939
especially considering the current state

677
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:45,308
of the union and they definitely should

678
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,379
be because at the end of the day I mean

679
00:27:45,308 --> 00:27:52,418
we've seen so many community benefits to

680
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:55,959
having licensed marijuana businesses

681
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:58,509
within your communities and we know that

682
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,308
our roads are safer we know that high

683
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:04,378
school students here in Colorado are

684
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:08,528
using less illicit drugs overall and

685
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:12,009
there's a lot of tax advantages and

686
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:13,690
other ways that you can incorporate the

687
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:17,079
benefits of having cannabis businesses

688
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:19,538
in your community as long as you're part

689
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:23,678
of actually making that legislation and

690
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:26,829
part of bringing it there I am concerned

691
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,710
I mean in Colorado as far as I'm

692
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:33,548
concerned we have this like gold

693
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:35,499
standard because effectively it's close

694
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:39,190
to unlimited licensing relative to other

695
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:41,980
states and as a result we've been able

696
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,859
to see so many wonderful small

697
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,829
businesses and mom-and-pop dispensaries

698
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:50,749
in Mountain

699
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:53,509
flourish and it's amazing and it's the

700
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:56,569
type of like small business revolution

701
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:58,819
and and what I hear especially with

702
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:02,808
incorporating hemp but you know small

703
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:05,749
business agricultural revolution that is

704
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:08,148
you can see the future if we make the

705
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:12,048
right decisions from a regulatory

706
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:14,628
perspective and and if we allow access

707
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:18,168
to this business to small business

708
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:21,798
owners that you know don't have the big

709
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:24,499
dollars that now are necessary in new

710
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:28,788
states coming on to acquire a cannabis

711
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:30,259
business license so I hope people more

712
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:31,908
people get involved in finding out

713
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:33,769
exactly how regulations are being

714
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:36,049
incorporated in their states if they

715
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:38,058
live in prohibition states so that they

716
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:41,179
ensure that small business owners and

717
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:43,928
local community interests are taken into

718
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:45,980
account as marijuana licenses are issued

719
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:47,778
after the break we're going to talk more

720
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,460
about those entrepreneurs you are

721
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:51,858
listening to shaping fire and my guest

722
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:57,980
today is Jain West founder of women grow

723
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:59,808
and CEO at Jain West businesses

724
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,639
everywhere are constantly striving to

725
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:03,499
reach out to people through advertising

726
00:30:01,638 --> 00:30:05,118
we all know though that trying to reach

727
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:07,278
a cannabis audience with a quality

728
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:08,988
message is pretty difficult that's why

729
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,929
many people choose to advertise on the

730
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:13,850
shaping fire podcast advertising on this

731
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:15,919
show allows us time to talk about your

732
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:17,719
product service or brand in a way that

733
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,059
really lets people know what sets your

734
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,009
company apart from others bold people

735
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:23,509
who own companies know that getting in a

736
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:26,778
relationship with their customers is

737
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:28,819
essential that is what we offer we will

738
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:31,278
explain your service or product and what

739
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:33,499
sets it apart as desirable and help our

740
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,599
audience get in contact with you it's

741
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,409
pretty simple really

742
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,408
advertising does not have to be all

743
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:40,999
whiz-bang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

744
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:43,700
find that people prefer just to be

745
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:44,569
spoken to calmly accurately and with

746
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,399
good intentions

747
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:49,158
if you want to make your own commercial

748
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,048
spot you can do that too because the

749
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,480
podcast is young but growing in an

750
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:55,579
exceptionally fast rate if you become an

751
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,679
advertiser on the shaping fire podcast

752
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:59,048
now you are going to pay a fraction of

753
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,179
the cost we'd be asking for

754
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:03,429
in just a few months and yet everyone

755
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:05,739
listening both now and to the back

756
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:07,720
catalogue of interviews later will hear

757
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:10,389
about your company again and again for

758
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,579
years it's a great deal for you pay a

759
00:31:10,388 --> 00:31:14,738
small amount now because the show is new

760
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:17,288
but take advantage of the huge listening

761

767
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:34,119
your host Shango Louis and our guest

768
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:37,749
this week is Jane West founder of women

769
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:39,548
grow and CEO at Jane West so you know in

770
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:41,230
the last section we were talking a lot

771
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:43,269
about the people who came to the events

772
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,579
and they had a great time and they found

773
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:47,528
themselves wanting to stay in cannabis

774
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:49,028
they wanted to go to more events they

775
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:51,278
wanted to get more involved maybe they

776
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:53,648
became activists and I'm I'm pretty sure

777
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,019
that you know being more of an upscale

778
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:58,358
audience I can imagine that many of your

779
00:31:56,019 --> 00:32:00,700
guests immediately shared your vision

780
00:31:58,358 --> 00:32:03,368
and started cannabis businesses of their

781
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,850
own did your edible events spawn a

782
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:08,980
series of new canvas entrepreneurs I

783
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:12,459
mean I definitely get the impression

784
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:15,460
that that is what occurred and and it's

785
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,889
amazing to see I mean one of my

786
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,579
colleagues from the very beginning Heidi

787
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:22,479
Keyes

788
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:24,220
she started puff pass paint in Colorado

789
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,858
at the exact same time that I started

790
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,528
edible dense company and she's in like

791
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:32,259
five states now and also has puffed past

792
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:34,960
pottery that one of one of my fellow

793
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:37,028
moms at my kids school teaches they and

794
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,069
may make little pottery pieces just like

795
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:43,419
all the cannabis or canvas and cocktail

796
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:46,319
classes right so I hope I definitely

797
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:49,869
think it has I get a lot of messages

798
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:52,749
speaking to that and that's great to see

799
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:54,730
and I hope we just continue to inspire

800
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:58,028
more and more people to get into the

801
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:01,028
space it's really about building a

802
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:04,690
community and it's really and how

803
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:07,179
there's so much room for growth here and

804
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:10,600
I want to want more and more diverse

805
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:11,620
groups to be joining the space so that

806
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:14,859
that next generate

807
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:17,319
can see themselves in what they want to

808
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:21,250
build in the future so I certainly hope

809
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:25,480
so and it's fun to see all the new ideas

810
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:30,160
and and you need that new fresh energy

811
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:33,730
and idealism to keep you going through

812
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,790
the like year three and four of being an

813
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,849
entrepreneur so it's good to have to

814
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:43,269
have have that energy coming in so in

815
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:44,799
2014 you decided to go you know full-on

816
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:47,740
with your support of new entrepreneurs

817
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,440
and you raised 42,000 dollars to launch

818
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,839
women grow would you say that this was

819
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,210
the next logical step for you after

820
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:57,099
after cultivating all these new cannabis

821
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,019
enthusiasts that that you might as well

822
00:33:57,099 --> 00:34:00,579
help them succeed by networking in a

823
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:02,650
cannabis world and help the industry

824
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:05,649
evolve in a healthier way then it would

825
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:07,330
have without as many women leaders well

826
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:10,480
there were there were two things that

827
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:13,659
were obvious to me in 2014 and and one

828
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:18,190
of them was this incredible demand and

829
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:22,450
interest to have a job in the space and

830
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:24,340
and how there just wasn't access to even

831
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:26,710
find out how to start doing that for

832
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,860
instance when I started my business I

833
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:32,559
could search the word cannabis within my

834
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,628
LinkedIn profile and get through maybe

835
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:39,039
like 2 or 3 pages of people who actually

836
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:42,460
had that word in their bio anywhere and

837
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:44,139
be done and now it just is endless

838
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,199
there's thousands of people I have over

839
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:48,849
10,000 contacts and most of them are in

840
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,210
some way shape or form in the cannabis

841
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:56,378
space so so we needed to get them more

842
00:34:52,210 --> 00:35:00,610
connected back in 2014 and then secondly

843
00:34:56,378 --> 00:35:02,139
it became very clear that at the end of

844
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:05,559
the day marijuana legalization is a

845
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:07,299
local issue and if you're going to

846
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:09,119
succeed and if you're going to have a

847
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,410
successful business in your community

848
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,359
you're going to have to work with your

849
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:16,269
local community or local regulators and

850
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,620
have a network of other businesses and

851
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:22,869
colleagues that will help you succeed in

852
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:25,569
your area I women were contacting me

853
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:27,250
almost daily in 2014

854
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,660
with all the different like media news

855
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,159
stories that were coming out about what

856
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:32,289
I was building with edible event and

857
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,549
asking me how I can get into the space

858
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:34,900
how can I do this how can I get in the

859
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,910
space I want to get more involved I want

860
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,960
to start your business now now let's be

861
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:42,849
clear in like April of 2014 I had just

862
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,320
been fired from my job in corporate

863
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,989
America which I did not think would

864
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,890
happen as quickly as it did and then

865
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:53,199
also I had had a SWAT team attend one of

866
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,789
my events and and was told that I

867
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,799
couldn't even hold those anymore so I

868
00:35:54,789 --> 00:36:00,460
didn't necessarily think I was the best

869
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:04,720
person to be providing um career advice

870
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:08,409
to people but I did observe that it was

871
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:11,139
the local network of support that the

872
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:14,019
women here in Colorado referenced when

873
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:16,659
it came to why their businesses were

874
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:19,869
success and who they turn to for support

875
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:22,149
and we needed to create those local

876
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:24,039
networks among all the different women

877
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:27,039
that were reaching out to me to get into

878
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:29,590
the space and by offering them a

879
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,360
platform to possibly you know start

880
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,579
their own women grow market in their own

881
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,260
City and then have that position while

882
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:37,569
they build their network and while they

883
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:41,160
build their contacts it all you know

884
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:43,750
seemed to make sense and be win-win so

885
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:46,629
that's what we started doing and and

886
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:50,260
it's been incredible to watch it grow

887
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:52,480
and and how different each chapter is in

888
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,030
each city and how they flourished it's

889
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,610
amazing creating this new opportunity

890
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:59,680
and creating this new opportunity in so

891
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,450
many new cities it brings a lot of

892
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,750
different kinds of people you know I was

893
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:06,279
interviewed a see Braddock from Eden

894
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,010
labs who I believe is a women grow

895
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,290
member just last week and and you know

896
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,930
we talked about the apparent difference

897
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:16,119
in approach between folks who you know

898
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:18,369
see the healing powers of cannabis

899
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,889
versus the folks who are just here to

900
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,960
make a buck the the plant teaches those

901
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:26,529
who use it how to be you know less

902
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,240
authoritative less greedy more open to

903
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,340
experience and yet there are others

904
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,559
coming from other industries who may not

905
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,650
even toke and who see cannabis is merely

906
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:37,329
a commodity to make money in it with

907
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,710
what's what's your own vision of the

908
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:41,409
future do you think that

909
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,900
were more likely to warm these newcomers

910
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:45,519
to cannabis up to the spiritual side or

911
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,740
do you think that there may always be

912
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,719
this schism between folks and cannabis

913
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:52,919
for the heart of it versus those here

914
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:55,179
just to fill the balance sheet hmm

915
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,170
that's an interesting question you know

916
00:37:55,179 --> 00:38:01,809
I feel like for a lot of people who are

917
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,750
looking for jobs within the industry

918
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:06,608
especially a lot of the women that I

919
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,739
work with who like are looking to apply

920
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:10,088
some of their like soft skills to the

921
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:13,118
canvas business like for instance like

922
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:16,480
training or HR or bookkeeping or

923
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,420
marketing photography graphic design you

924
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,760
know they're interested in what we're

925
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,039
building here and especially in how many

926
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,050
female led businesses they can work for

927
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:29,039
for and work with and and that's awesome

928
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:31,359
and a lot of them then as a result of

929
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,739
learning about a product or learning

930
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,710
about marketing and or learning about a

931
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:38,529
business decide that they want to try

932
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,670
cannabis and that how maybe start

933
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,210
thinking about how they can incorporate

934
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:45,608
it into their lives and and those seem

935
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:50,170
to be the individual at a handful of

936
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:52,358
women like Becca Foster are lost a ton

937
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,039
of weight and and look to turned over a

938
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:57,159
new leaf and found all the wellness

939
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:59,829
benefits of the product as well and and

940
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:02,079
so that's really fun to see when when

941
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:03,579
someone because they've their career

942
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,098
path has brought them into the space

943
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:08,858
started to you know utilize the plant

944
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:12,609
more and really you know open their eyes

945
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:16,679
to all the benefits on the other side I

946
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:16,679
would I'm more concerned about

947
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,670
individuals that don't use a plant or

948
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,589
don't have a relationship with cannabis

949
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:30,750
at all that are coming in on the more

950
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:30,750
like big money and investor side because

951
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:35,469
they're in control of the businesses and

952
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,349
they're in control of the products and

953
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:41,649
they're making decisions about marketing

954
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:46,599
these products and if you don't have any

955
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:49,450
in in a a close relationship with the

956
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:51,260
plants with how and why you incorporate

957
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:53,239
canvas into your life

958
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,490
also therefore hopefully an

959
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:58,579
understanding of like the social justice

960
00:39:55,489 --> 00:40:01,250
issues and why the war on drugs with war

961
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:03,739
on people and how all of that is part of

962
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,530
the history of this plant and and part

963
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:09,109
of legalization it becomes concerning

964
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:12,350
that now there's so much money in this

965
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,849
base that the people make ultimately

966
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:17,210
making the decisions and then are in

967
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:20,690
positions of power may not have that

968
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,909
like kind of education but I would hope

969
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:25,220
they would have that you can only get

970
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:29,239
from incorporating canvas into your life

971
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:32,959
or really you know learning more about

972
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:37,189
the war on drugs and what is done and

973
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:40,639
how is you know decimated families from

974
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:43,369
the very beginning so so that's kind of

975
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,019
a loaded question um yeah totally loaded

976
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:46,279
and you know I think that it's something

977
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:48,590
that we're all going to have to deal

978
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,600
with right because for certain the

979
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:53,300
Moller more that often than not the

980
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,759
visionary behind the company who

981
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,920
hopefully is is is creating the brand

982
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,930
experience and the copywriting they

983
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,670
probably are in cannabis because they're

984
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:04,190
passionate about it but then you start

985
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:06,920
to bring in outside investment and it's

986
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:09,800
amazing the you know the the visionary

987
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,809
CEO certainly has influence but there's

988
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,630
no question that that where the money

989
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:15,949
comes from is also an influencer and I

990
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,700
think that the best thing that we can do

991
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:22,969
is normalize and invite these people

992
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:25,849
into cannabis as as consumers as quickly

993
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:29,599
as we can I actually loved the one that

994
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:32,269
you said you know people who have you

995
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,279
said something like instant not involved

996
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:35,929
cannabis in their life and I and I

997
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,670
pictured you know an evangelist on the

998
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:40,309
street you know going up to people have

999
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:46,519
you have you an accepting anibus into

1000
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:48,440
your life so so your your own line of

1001
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:50,360
new products known as the Jain West

1002
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,250
collection are a wonderful balance of

1003
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,820
you know both beauty and functionality

1004
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,619
they're discrete and yet instantly

1005
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,150
recognizable from like a branding point

1006
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:01,219
of view they're they're nice bro

1007
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,380
silicate pieces made in partnership with

1008
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,059
grav labs who I've been a fan of for a

1009
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,920
long

1010
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:09,219
and you know grab is known for their

1011
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,440
simple elegance I dare say that the Jain

1012
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:14,139
West line looks to be like the Kate

1013
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,269
Spade of Canada's their high-end design

1014
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:18,940
super desirable and really functional

1015
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:21,009
and in your advertising copy you make it

1016
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,980
clear that your market are these new

1017
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:26,530
cannabis consumers and you know very

1018
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,990
especially women as Jane West the

1019
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,640
company brings new products to the

1020
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:32,019
market what do you want to offer these

1021
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,719
new users that they're not already

1022
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:38,289
finding elsewhere well you know just

1023
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,409
like the events that I created I wanted

1024
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:44,230
these products to exist and I couldn't

1025
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:47,710
find anything that met in the market

1026
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:51,579
that matched my aesthetic and so I'm

1027
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:53,320
hoping to just fill that gap that I see

1028
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:56,199
existing there

1029
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,750
I've definitely wanted something with a

1030
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:00,699
lot of functionality but that also has

1031
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,519
that sleek design that you would have

1032
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:06,009
you know the more we normalize cannabis

1033
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,980
use the more these products will be out

1034
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:12,010
in your home and that you will use them

1035
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,559
for entertaining with guests and so the

1036
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,750
way I picture a legal future you know

1037
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,150
people have you know little pipes around

1038
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,590
their home in the same numbers and

1039
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:25,119
proportions that they had a little shot

1040
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:27,369
glasses and so so in order to have a

1041
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,170
collection and in order that like just

1042
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:29,740
like you have eight wine glasses at your

1043
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:31,450
house

1044
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:34,269
you want to be as replicable products

1045
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:35,710
you want something that matches the

1046
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:37,480
aesthetics of your home something you

1047
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,480
would put out for guests and so that's

1048
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:44,800
what I wanted to bring into the world

1049
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:46,780
and to create we have flower hour here

1050
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,410
at my house just like you have the hour

1051
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:52,980
and so these are the products that are

1052
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:55,420
part of that like dream future of mine

1053
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,550
the market segment that you and I've

1054
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,710
been chatting about today is rapidly

1055
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,600
expanding and in the copywriting and

1056
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,000
products to reach them has not really

1057
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,449
been invented yet what advice do you

1058
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,619
offer other entrepreneurs who want to

1059
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:13,839
reach this market as well um yeah I

1060
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:17,500
would the thief first and foremost do

1061
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,050
not assume what your customers want

1062
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,579
for me in what I'm building it's a

1063
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,880
little bit easier because I'm only

1064
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:28,690
creating what I want to use and products

1065
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,329
that I would use on a daily basis and so

1066
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,280
that's kind of my check mark but as

1067
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:35,529
you're creating products for you know a

1068
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,110
larger demo and users beyond yourself as

1069
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:40,240
well you should talk to your customers a

1070
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:42,460
lot more than you think

1071
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,799
identify some individuals that you think

1072
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,480
will be your exactly your core customers

1073
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,460
and make sure Mulva numb in

1074
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,130
conversations early on about the

1075
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,320
products just like I have wide-ranging

1076
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,640
focus groups for all of my products as

1077
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,500
well

1078
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,150
you'll learn little things that you

1079
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,400
haven't even thought of yet that are

1080
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:03,639
crucial in terms of talking to new

1081
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,550
consumers for instance I was in a

1082
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:08,319
branding meeting last year where we kept

1083
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,210
referring to different strains you're

1084
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,460
like what strange wheezes for what

1085
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,190
strange means that foreign and one of

1086
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,559
the newbies there was like why are you

1087
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:21,670
saying strain it sounds like an illness

1088
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:23,769
like a disease like a strain because I

1089
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,860
why don't you call it like a varietal

1090
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:29,289
and and like that's more like wine and

1091
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:31,150
that's what you really mean right these

1092
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:34,409
are different varieties of cannabis

1093
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:38,619
right and and that's the type of like

1094
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:40,899
important learning that helps us as we

1095
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:45,219
start to like literally create this

1096
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:47,860
lexicon um in a whole new market and so

1097
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:51,119
talk to your consumers um secondly I

1098
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:54,370
would make sure is telling the truth I

1099
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,170
have like a problem overall with

1100
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:59,079
marketing and branding in this country

1101
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,470
you know I have a shampoo in I'm 40

1102
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:02,110
years old

1103
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:04,389
abbis shampoo in my in my shower right

1104
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:07,360
now that says that it's going to like

1105
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:10,750
prevent my hair from breaking or turning

1106
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:13,510
gray and extra moisturizes all the cells

1107
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,630
of my skull and like I don't know if all

1108
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:19,840
of that is true it seems like a stretch

1109
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:21,369
um so when we're really educating

1110
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,430
consumers about this brand new product

1111
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:26,230
let's not exaggerate let's be you know

1112
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:30,149
as straightforward as we can about the

1113
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,858
products let's keep it clean

1114
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:35,670
and let's make sure you know we're

1115
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:38,098
educating the consumer about how to

1116
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:40,920
incorporate these products into their

1117
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:43,950
lives and a lot of that's anecdotal and

1118
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,470
a lot of people will be talking talking

1119
00:46:43,949 --> 00:46:48,899
first hands with your customers and when

1120
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:50,248
happy customers is a great way to find

1121
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,519
out more information about how they

1122
00:46:50,248 --> 00:46:55,679
utilize your product yeah and then

1123
00:46:53,518 --> 00:46:58,199
lastly just keep if you keep creating

1124
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,629
what you love then you're going to be

1125
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:03,960
fine you'll be on the right path like

1126
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:06,210
that you know there's vision is really

1127
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:10,409
everything in this space right now

1128
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:14,608
because we're creating this new market

1129
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:17,670
and in order to actually have your

1130
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:20,278
company scale and succeed you're going

1131
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:22,440
to be you're going to need to be able to

1132
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:25,679

1133

looks like and so you know make sure

1134
