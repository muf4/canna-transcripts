2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,799
isn't it strange and exciting to

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,839
suddenly see psilocybin mushrooms

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,679
everywhere

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,439
even though as a species we have been

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,399
taking mushrooms since the very first

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,719
humans existed

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,719
and perhaps even before it seems like

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,559
some sort of threshold was crossed about

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,239
six years or so ago

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,079
suddenly there were mushroom cultivation

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,439
classes all over the place

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,278
there was an explosion in the

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,198
availability of mushroom cultivation

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,039
books and the number of websites

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,719
providing spore syringes

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,280
of both culinary and psychedelic

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
mushrooms expanded from being a cautious

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
home industry

20
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,959
to being a bold and active and

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
competitive home industry

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,480
a few cities in the country even took

23
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,558
the radical step of reducing penalties

24
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,398
for possession and mushrooms too

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,399
all of this happened pretty smoothly and

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,079
elegantly after years and years of

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,558
intense repression

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
so here we are now listeners of shaping

29
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,479
fire very likely have either

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
microdosed mushrooms or lsd or

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,399
definitely know someone who has

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,079
people talk about it out in the open and

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,118
on talk shows like there's nothing to

34
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,798
fear at all

35
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,560
and honestly from what i'm seeing around

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
the country that is more or less

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,920
accurate

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,759
the medical establishment has embraced

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,079
medicinal mushroom psychedelics much

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,159
more swiftly than it has cannabis

41
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,438
indeed mushrooms are being adopted

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,118
faster in part

43
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,599
because of the work that activists have

44
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,280
done to normalize cannabis

45
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,919
there is a significant wave of

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,879
pro-mushroom sentiment and it is growing

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,040
as a good pun shaping fire stands with

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,879
the mushroom educators cultivators

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,799
neighborhood distributors and all of us

50
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,679
healing from trauma or reaching out for

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159

manufacturing

105
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,759
he sold his companies and pivoted into

106
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,239
mushrooms after using psilocybin to

treat his treatment resistant depression

108
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,360
today we're going to compare and

109
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,159
contrast several approaches to micro

110
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,360
dosing psilocybin mushrooms

111
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,878
welcome to shaping fire adam

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,120
thanks for having me nothing i'd rather

113
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,199
do than talk microdosing with you today

114
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
fantastic fantastic so you know we

115
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,199
should probably state right from the

116
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,959
jump

117
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,639
that we're going to be talking about

118
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,039
mushroom therapies that are still

119
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,039
federally illegal and while there has

120
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,878
been an increase in both licensed and

121
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,239
unlicensed research into mushrooms

122
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,399
we're going to be talking about a

123
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,120
substance that is illegal without

124
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
question

125
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,759
so neither adam nor i are suggesting

126
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,158
that you use mushrooms and we are

127
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,840
certainly not offering you any

128
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,639
with the episode today our goal is to

129
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,799
provide a quality interpretation

130
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,759
of the knowledge that's already publicly

131
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,239
available

132
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,639
so you can make informed decisions for

133
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,639
your health and when you go to vote

134
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,839
so this statement covers the entirety of

135
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,918
the episode too

136
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,560
so please enjoy the episode in an

137
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,159
academic way that it was intended

138
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,000
so adam anything you want to add to that

139
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,759
before we move on

140
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,839
yeah i always like to mention i'm not a

141
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,680
medical doctor and i am not

142
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,918
advising you to do anything we are

143
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,959
simply here to educate you

144
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,399
and talk about micro dosing fabulous

145
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,399
all right so with us all on the same

146
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,560
page on that let's get started by

147
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,719
setting a little bit of context here

148
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,918
certainly much has been said about

149
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,919
taking full

150
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,000
psychedelic trips on mushrooms of you

151
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,159
know two or three or more grams and

152
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,079
we know that these experiences can offer

153
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,439
both psychological and spiritual healing

154
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,039
and connection and that's great

155
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,560
but today we're going to be talking very

156
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,919
specifically about taking

157
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,079
regular very small doses of psilocybin

158
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,560
mushrooms a few times a week

159
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,519
adam what can micro dosing offer an

160
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,759
enthusiast

161
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,799
that is different than taking a more

162
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,319
traditional dose of a few grams

163
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,079
that's a great question and i think the

164
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,918
easiest way to sum it up is when you're

165
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,599
micro dosing there are no classic

166
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,359
psychedelic effects

167
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,639
so when you're doing a large dose

168
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,439
journey

169
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,879
you might have visuals you feel

170
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,959
extremely high

171
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,918
you are aware that you've taken a

172
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,038
substance

173
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,560
time may be distorted visuals will be

174
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,560
distorted

175
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,478
nothing like that happens when you're

176
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,079
micro dosing it is considered a

177
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,399
subperceptual dose

178
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,198
meaning below the perception that you're

179
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,478
really noticing it

180
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,080
you might notice slight bit of energy

181
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,000
increase in mood but other than that it

182
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,318
does not have any classic psychedelic

183
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
effects the flowers are not talking to

184
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,600
you

185
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,319
the the doorknob doesn't have a mustache

186
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,560
you know

187
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
it's something that you take in your

188
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,918
day-to-day life

189
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
you can still function you can still be

190
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:10,399
a parent you can still drive a car

191
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,919
you can still work your job so i want to

192
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,000
get across to your listeners that

193
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,639
microdosing is very different

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,639
than large dose journeys or macrodosing

195
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,160
it doesn't have any psychedelic effects

196
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,319
and you're taking a very

197
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,759
very small what we like to say

198
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
sub-perceptual amount

199
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,360
meaning below the perception that you

200
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,720
notice it of psilocybin

201
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,639
that's great so let's let's talk a

202
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,520
little bit about that threshold

203
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
point very specifically because at some

204
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,799
point we're going to be talking about

205
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,919
people of about you know how much is in

206
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,919
a micro dose

207
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,359
for the for the various protocols that

208
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,758
we're going to be talking about

209
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
and you know some people are all like

210
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,840
all right so

211
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,240
so what is subperceptual and what is not

212
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,799
so

213
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,720
so clearly we're not talking about you

214
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
know freestanding hallucinations

215
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,880
and the examples that you gave but but

216
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,840
some people aren't sure whether or not

217
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,000
subperceptual is for example

218
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,519
at low doses some people feel like

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,439
something is brewing

220
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,279
in their belly like they can feel

221
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,759
something might come on but with micro

222
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,598
dosing

223
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,840
it doesn't ever come on it's just like

224
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,360
you feel like there's something brewing

225
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,439
is is that considered sub um perceptual

226
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,000
or is or is are there are there

227
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,279
gradations to that

228
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,639
yeah that's a great question and it's

229
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,478
different for everyone and again

230
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,160
subperceptual might not be the best word

231
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,959
to describe it because there's plenty of

232
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
people

233
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,159
that feel energy when they're micro

234
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,839
dosing okay

235
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,439
what we want to make a delineation

236
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,598
between is

237
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,719
micro dosing where maybe you're feeling

238
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,800
a little bit of energy

239
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
and you're getting that extra boost per

240
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,520
se to

241
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,478
mini dosing which is anxiety in my

242
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,560
stomach

243
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,598
i really feel the substance i'm

244
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,079
wondering if i'm

245
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,680
coming on is it going to get stronger so

246
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,399
there is a fine line

247
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,240
between the mini dose and the micro dose

248
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,239
and that's different for everybody

249
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,160
right so what we like to say when we're

250
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,639
educating people is everybody needs to

251
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,720
find their individual sweet spot

252
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,800
a micro dose for me might be different

253
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,560
than a micro dose for yourself everybody

254
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,240
has different levels of tolerances

255
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,319
different ways that these

256
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,439
mushrooms work with their body so again

257
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,800
it's different for

258
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,399
everyone some people do like to feel a

259
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
little bit of energy like to feel a

260
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,038
little bit more of the substance when

261
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,839
they are micro dosing so they may take

262
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,279
a little bit more i think it's important

263
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,679
when you're microdosing that you're

264
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,159
still

265
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,598
able to do everything that you would do

266
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,918
in your normal life

267
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,240
right and i say that a lot of times

268
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,399
anxiety is a good indication

269
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
if your dose is too high or if it's a

270
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,440
microdose

271
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
if you've taken psilocybin and your

272
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
anxiety

273
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,319
is heightened and you're not feeling

274
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,320
like being social

275
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,560
i believe in my opinion that that's a

276
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
mini dose and that's not a microdose a

277
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,239
microdose

278
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,278
should be at a level that makes you more

279
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
sociable

280
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,039
that lowers your anxiety so what's

281
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,880
important in microdosing is that when

282
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,759
people are experimenting with it

283
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,838
they have to start low and go slow if

284
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,080
they start at a really low dosage

285
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
and then they have to experiment with

286
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,839
what is too much what is too little

287
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,679
and what is just right it's kind of the

288
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
goldilocks analogy now that i think

289
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,000
about it you know you have to

290
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,559
start logo slow but maybe you might have

291
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,159
to take a little bit too much some time

292
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,599
to realize what the difference is

293
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,399
between subperceptual

294
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
microdose and a minidose so when i was

295
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,399
originally

296
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,159
learning microdosing people tended to

297
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,519
suggest to me anyway

298
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:38,799
that a default setting microdose was

299
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,240
0.1 gram and for me

300
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:45,039
i found that i felt more of the effects

301
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,639
at point one that what i could consider

302
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,079
sub-perceptual right i definitely felt

303
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,600
it at point one and so

304
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,480
i kept on bringing brought it down to

305
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
0.9 then 0.8 and then 0.7 and i find for

306
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,839
me that if

307
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,480
if i really need to not feel it really

308
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,839
from for me it's more like 0.6 or 0.7

309
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
which you know gets chuckles from

310
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,320
friends but

311
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,000
you know there really is an important

312
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
difference between a micro and

313
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
a mini dose in how you're planning on

314
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,360
spending your day

315
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,639
so if we're if we're if our goal is to

316
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,759
start uh

317
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,078
low and increase slowly

318
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,919
what would you consider to be you know

319
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,120
based on what you're hearing from people

320
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,360
reporting to you

321
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
how low is the appropriate place to

322
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
start like is

323
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,839
you know is like 0.05 like a

324
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,159
like a place to start and then like go

325
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,360
up by .01s or or

326
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,000
what do you what are you seeing in your

327
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,399
experience yeah i think

328
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
0.05 is exactly where you start which is

329
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
50 milligrams

330
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
and you know i run a micro dosing

331
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,839
support network with the san francisco

332
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,160
psychedelic

333
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,040
society twice a month and we have people

334
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,639
show up

335
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,399
that share with us their personal

336
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,600
stories and one gentleman

337
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,000
a few weeks ago a full grown ass man

338
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,440
probably weighing between 180 and 200

339
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
pounds which shows you that it's not

340
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,800
strictly related to size of the person

341
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
or weight

342
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,240
was telling our group that he only needs

343
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,039
.02

344
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
or 20 milligrams so what i want to get

345
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,919
across to people

346
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,159
is people everyone is unique and

347
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,000
different there's no standard dose

348
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,120
away that psilocybin is going to hit you

349
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,958
not to mention there are different

350
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,799
varieties of psilocybin and different

351
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,958
strengths so that also

352
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,599
could hit you differently so i would

353
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,399
start at like you said 50 milligrams

354
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,040
and then go up to 75 and then go up to

355
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,679
100

356
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,120
and then go up to 125 and 150 and go up

357
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,439
maybe at 25

358
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,799
milligram increments but you know i have

359
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,000
to be honest with you i believe there

360
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,439
are a lot of people out there that are

361
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,120
micro dosing that are

362
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
really just enjoying getting high and

363
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
they're taking more

364
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,319
than is considered a micro dose and they

365
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
have are having some of the classic

366
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,040
psychedelic

367
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,879
effects throughout their day and they're

368
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,199
enjoying it because it is different than

369
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,200
a large dose journey you can function

370
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,959
but there is a fine line between micro

371
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,120
dose and mini dose

372
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,919
and it depends on what you're looking

373
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,560
for and again with the start logo slow

374
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,519
50 milligrams is a great place to start

375
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,039
so if somebody

376
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,879
is taking that little bit more

377
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,159
than a micro dose so that they're now

378
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,838
taking a mini dose

379
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:14,399
and they do feel it and it's just adding

380
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,079
positivity to their day so long as it's

381
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
not taking away

382
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,359
from their you know functioning the way

383
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,759
they want to during the day

384
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
is there any inherent reason why a

385
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,200
microdose

386
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,879
is superior than that slightly larger

387
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,560
mini dose

388
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,000
i mean who am i to say that either one

389
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,838
is superior really

390
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,159
you know to be honest with you i have

391
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
days where i mini dose or i might be out

392
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,120
in nature and

393
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,800
and i want might take a little bit more

394
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,799
for connection you know that's unique to

395
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,599
the individual and their experience and

396
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,838
what they

397
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
get out of it again i i'm not anyone

398
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,160
special to say that people shouldn't

399
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,078
thoroughly enjoy mini dosing i mean i

400
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,639
know that there are times where i enjoy

401
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,479
concert dose when i dose properly and

402
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,320
there are times when people enjoy the

403
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,920
museum dose which is a little bit less

404
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,959
than a concert dose

405
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,199
so again i think there are great ways to

406
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,919
mini dose and museum dose and concert

407
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,240
dose

408
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,159
but here's the caveat and the disclaimer

409
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
is you have to be

410
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,838
you know somewhat of an expert

411
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,759
psychonaut you have to somewhat know

412
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,680
what you're doing because these are

413
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,278
powerful tools and you want to be safe

414
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,519
and you want to be in a good setting

415
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,439
setting so again i really don't work

416
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,679
with people in large dose

417
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,480
or mini dose i like to just strictly

418
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,599
stay in

419
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,120
in the micro dose area but absolutely

420
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
there are benefits from

421
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,720
many dosing and people that enjoy taking

422
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,839
a little bit more

423
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,759
um so yeah i think that there are there

424
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,440
are benefits to each level of dose and

425
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,519
again you know we've seen that

426
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,519
terence mckenna for a long time and the

427
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,000
five grand hero journey has been a sign

428
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,679
of

429
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,078
you know the large dose and in in

430
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,120
reality there's also kalindi who was

431
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,638
talking about taking

432
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,560
30 40 grams of mushrooms so

433
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,159
again you know dosages are different and

434
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,879
unique to everybody

435
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,838
and i can't say that micro dosing is

436
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,639
superior

437
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
to mini dosing but what i want to say

438
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,519
about

439
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,078
keeping it in that micro dosing range is

440
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,759
uh

441
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,759
you know it's it's it's more sub

442
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,879
perceptual you're not noticing

443
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,120
um necessarily that you're high as much

444
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,559
fantastic so one thing before we go on

445
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,480
to talking specifically about the

446
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,000
stamets i know we're not talking about

447
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,800
macro doses today

448
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,360
but you're so well versed at talking

449
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,479
about

450
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,639
psychedelics would you please explain

451
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
set and setting for folks because even

452
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,159
if it doesn't have to do with the show

453
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,399
today i think it's a healthy thing for

454
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,919
us to remind and make sure more people

455
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,519
are aware of

456
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,360
yeah sentence setting is something that

457
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,198
leary developed years ago i think still

458
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,680
while he was at harvard and it's the

459
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,799
idea

460
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,359
set meaning your mindset and

461
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,479
setting meaning the outside environment

462
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,079
that you're in

463
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,240
and the idea is psychedelics are

464
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,120
powerful powerful tools these are not

465
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,560
for everybody

466
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,120
right and set you have to take them

467
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,479
when you're in a good mindset these are

468
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,799
not something you should take when

469
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,759
you're

470
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,639
really struggling or having a really

471
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,039
difficult time

472
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,759
and then setting you have to be so

473
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,000
careful

474
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,439
when taking large doses about what your

475
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
outside setting is

476
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,800
and to be honest with you in the past

477
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
i've been very

478
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,159
uh you know i've definitely taken large

479
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
doses

480
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,719
in the wrong settings and it has been

481
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,198
very uncomfortable and i would not

482
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,800
recommend it to anyone so for beginners

483
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,838
out there who are thinking about a large

484
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,799
dose journey

485
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,839
again the idea of set and setting uh

486
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,319
tends to be

487
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,560
the most important factor uh probably

488
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,000
next to dosage

489
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,479
that depends or uh decides whether or

490
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,799
not

491
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,879
you have quote unquote a positive or a

492
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,439
quote-unquote bad experience

493
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,639
right on thank you for that so the focus

494
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
of today's episode

495
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,079
is to compare two of the most popular

496
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,519
protocols for

497
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:00,239
taking low doses of psilocybin mushrooms

498
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,320
and the first is the protocol offered by

499
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,079
paul stamets and the second we will talk

500
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,879
about is the approach offered by james

501
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,519
fatiman

502
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,198
now both scientists are seen as

503
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
visionaries in the field and it isn't

504
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,120
our goal to really say

505
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,278
one is necessarily better than the other

506
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,679
um these protocols usually involve

507
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,039
taking a combination of mushrooms and

508
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,078
other supplements

509
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,159
and and when taken together these these

510
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,599
different attribute components are known

511
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,838
as a stack

512
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,199
so people you often pure people refer to

513
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,399
them as the stamets

514
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,399
stack or the fatima stack um our goal is

515
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,480
to present each of them today in such a

516
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,480
way that you can weigh them for yourself

517
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,159
and more importantly discuss them with

518
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
other people so adam

519
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,000
would you please walk us through the

520
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,399
combination of substances

521
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,679
that paul stamets suggests mushrooms be

522
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,958
taken with together

523
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:53,120
as the stamets microdose stack

524
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,879
yeah long live paul stamets post damn

525
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,198
it's for president of the universe

526
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,879
um so paul stamets was the first one

527
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,958
i've heard of to

528
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,439
come up with the idea of stacking other

529
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,198
functional mushrooms with psilocybin

530
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
while microdosing and he developed

531
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,640
what's known as the stamit stack which

532
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,160
is stacking

533
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,360
psilocybin with lion's mane and niacin

534
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,160
the lion's mane is a mushroom that

535
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,159
increases neuroplasticity as well as

536
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,919
neurogenesis which is the same thing but

537
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,880
the psilocybin does

538
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,319
so i again uh learned from paul and i'm

539
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,319
a strong believer in

540
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,558
stacking your lion's mane with the

541
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,960
psilocybin and then he added niacin

542
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,319
as well which is an activation and

543
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,840
flushing agent and

544
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,000
when i've heard him speak about it he

545
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,759
talks about uh the ability for the

546
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,839
niacin to bring

547
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,759
the mushrooms to the tips of the fingers

548
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,519
and the tips the toes and to get it

549
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,000
spread out really effectively throughout

550
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,079
the body that is the stamit stack

551
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,480
and with that stack he developed his

552
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,480
protocol protocol meaning

553
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,319
what is the schedule for days on and

554
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,240
days off during the week that you're

555
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,359
going to microdose because again one of

556
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,359
the most important things about

557
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,159
microdosing is this is not something you

558
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,159
do

559
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,480
seven days a week this is not a western

560
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,440
medical model of

561
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,798
anti-depressants every day for the rest

562
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,558
of your life so

563
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,400
they've developed protocols first

564
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,160
starting with dr fatima's protocol

565
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,160
and then paul stamets was the second one

566
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,720
to come up stamet's protocol

567
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,759
he has two actually they're four days on

568
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,120
three days off or

569
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,919
five days on two off when dr fatiman has

570
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,839
asked him

571
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,600
um what's the difference between the

572
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,000
protocols his answer is

573
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,119
uh it's the option to give people

574
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
flexibility

575
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,479
really more than anything and not to

576
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,400
lock into one

577
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,759
saying five two is better or four or

578
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
three is better so

579
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,000
one of the protocols that i recommend

580
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,119
often to the clients i work with

581
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,400
is the stamets protocol and uh i prefer

582
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,000
the 5-2

583
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,600
i think it works really well during the

584
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,519
week monday to friday you can take your

585
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,038
weekend off or you can you can switch it

586
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,639
out some other way but again

587
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,558
whether you're doing five days on two

588
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,640
days off or four days on

589
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,798
three days off it's a really great

590
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,520
protocol that paul has developed

591
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,079
and what's fascinating from these days

592
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,558
off

593
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,798
is not only in large dose psychedelics

594
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,720
but in small dose psychedelics there is

595
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,319
a 48 hour effect or what we call an

596
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,440
afterglow with the large dose

597
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:17,599
journeys so on your days off after the

598
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,440
substance has built up in your system

599
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,759
you are still benefiting from the

600
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,000
substance and sometimes your days off

601
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,798
can be better than your days on which is

602
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,440
really

603
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,038
um somewhat fascinating compared to to

604
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,798
the western medical

605
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,240
system and how their pharmaceuticals

606
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:37,119
work so that is the stamins protocol

607
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,200
so at the top of explaining the stack

608
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,439
you described both the psilocybin

609
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,519
and the lion's mane as causing

610
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,679
neurogenesis which um

611
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,000
we talk about a lot on this show as far

612
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,960
as how it works with the endocannabinoid

613
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,839
system

614
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,960
and and you know laying down new neural

615
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,558
pathways and

616
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,000
um and often cleaning up the the uh the

617
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,359
plaques that build up

618
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,919
um uh along the neural pathways as well

619
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,199
my question for you is do we know that

620
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,120
the lion's mane

621
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,240
and the psilocybin um

622
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,798
promote neurogenesis

623
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,599
in different ways you know so many of

624
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,240
the functions

625
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,879
of psilocybin we don't actually know yet

626
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
so

627
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,480
what can what kind of color can you add

628
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,599
to that about how the two of these work

629
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,919
together to

630
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,678
to cause our brain to heal and grow

631
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,960
yeah i'm pretty sure there aren't any

632
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,400
studies

633
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
where they're stacking lines maine and

634
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
psilocybin and seeing the benefits i

635
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,038
think

636
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,038
paul is hypothesizing off of individual

637
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,119
studies i think one being with lion's

638
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,519
mane and rats where they were able to

639
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,879
test the rats post mortem and and see

640
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,558
neurogenesis

641
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,480
and i think that they have done similar

642
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,240
studies with rats and psilocybin i think

643
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,038
one just came out in the last few weeks

644
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,359
where

645
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,240
uh the brains of rats that were given

646
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,519
psilocybin

647
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,159
a couple weeks post before their their

648
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,879
their killed and studied um had larger

649
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,000
brains

650
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,080
so again we don't have the studies

651
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,159
i think you know there might be a few

652
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,798
out there but i think that this is more

653
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,159
a hypothesis of uh what they believe is

654
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,759
happening

655
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,280
so i want to talk a little bit about the

656
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,240
niacin flush

657
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,440
um i liked your explanation that uh that

658
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,319
the niacin

659
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,279
uh actually helps with the transport of

660
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,839
moving

661
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,960
the psilocybin around the body so you

662
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,079
get more of a

663
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,279
full body experience of healing

664
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,839
and i had never heard it described that

665
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,319
way and i like that

666
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,279
i have back in the days in the mid 90s

667
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,439
when i was living

668
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,200
more close to you in the bay area you

669
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,240
know we were all into smart drugs and

670
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,279
newer tropics

671
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,079
and niacin flushes were popular for a

672
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,240
while

673
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,240
and we would take a high enough dosage

674
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,159
of niacin that we would you know

675
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,359
literally our skin would flush would get

676
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,880
red um

677
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,558
some people tend to would get a little

678
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,200
itchy on their skin but

679
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,839
but mostly just makes your face look

680
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,519
really

681
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:06,319
flush um should people be expecting

682
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,558
some flavor of that with the amount

683
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,279
that's recommended by stamets or is

684
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,480
is the amount of niacin much lower than

685
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,158
getting that that

686
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,519
nice and flush yeah if you get the nice

687
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,440
and flush that's an indication that

688
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,440
you're taking too much niacin

689
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,720
um and that's the feedback that i get

690
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,120
more often than not

691
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,679
um and why i don't use niacin personally

692
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,519
as people have a difficult time

693
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,440
finding an amount that does not cause

694
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,158
that flushing and redness

695
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,360
and and that type of feeling so um yeah

696
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,320
that's definitely something that's

697
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,119
reported often

698
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,399
about niacin so so even though you don't

699
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,558
use the niacin

700
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,759
yourself and i'm not personally a fan of

701
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,678
it myself either

702
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,879
um do you know off the top of your head

703
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,960
what the prescribed

704
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,440
niacin is part of the stamet stack is

705
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,200
just so people know it

706
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
you know what i want to guess something

707
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,679
like 50 milligrams but don't listen to

708
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,519
me

709
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,679
you can just search the stamet stack

710
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,599
online or or i think he gave a ted talk

711
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,798
on youtube you can find i don't know the

712
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,439
exact amount

713
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,519
for niacin you know i i believe strongly

714
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,519
in the stacking of mushrooms

715
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,000
flow state has a proprietary blend where

716
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,558
we stack chaga cordyceps

717
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,558
mataki and lion's mane and we feel like

718
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,639
all of those mushrooms

719
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,639
are creating somewhat of an entourage

720
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,240
effect like you see in cannabis

721
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,000
you know i'm someone who believes that

722
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,720
the whole plant uh

723
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,319
of cannabis is effective we don't know

724
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,600
everything that's going on with it we

725
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,918
haven't isolated

726
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,719
much more than thc and a few others so

727
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,720
again

728
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,400
i feel like with these mushrooms there

729
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,440
is something really special happening

730
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,759
when you combine

731
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,278
lion's mane with psilocybin there's

732
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,960
something really happen

733
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,119
really special happening when you add

734
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,880
chaga for immunity and cordyceps for

735
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,199
energy and stress

736
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,520
so again i think that this will also be

737
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,440
the future of nootropic drugs i've heard

738
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,558
paul stamets talk about how the future

739
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,558
of nootropics

740
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,639
are these microdosing stocks and that he

741
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,798
believes in the future

742
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,000
you know silicon valley firms will be

743
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,158
battling over

744
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,558
you know who's microdosing and who's not

745
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,480
and those employees that are microdosing

746
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,119
will be more valuable to the companies

747
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,960
so again i've seen it in my own own life

748
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,599
that microdosing in my opinion

749
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,519
grows the brain makes you more creative

750
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,959
blocks the default mode network gets you

751
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,679
out of the old rutted thinking that

752
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,679
you're used to

753
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,679
and feeling more energized and created

754
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,360
so there's amazing things going on in

755
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,200
the brain in the body and i think it's

756
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,918
really beneficial to add

757
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,000
uh other mushrooms to your regimen with

758
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,799
the psilocybin when you microdose

759
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,480
fantastic so before we talk about the

760
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,240
the fatimid protocol let's go ahead and

761
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,798

mendocino and trinity counties because

846
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,759
of his lineage and the hard-earned

847
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,000
experience that comes from growing up

848
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,079
smoking and sifting large populations of

849
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,319
cannabis plants in northern california

850
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,599
the seeds you'll cop from csi will be

851
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,918
winning genetics

852
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,918
based on long-time heavy hitters and

853
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,399
updated and re-sifted to bring out new

854
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,799
and exotic traits and better yields

855
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,918
go ahead and ask around caleb also known

856
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,839
as inspecta

00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,158
significant strains

861
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,079

00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,679
know all the seeds will be female

869
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,319
these are not experimental feminized

870
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,640
seeds humboldt csi releases some of the

871

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,440
last year here on vashon island

875
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,398

had beautiful

877
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,398
female plants and didn't have to cull

878
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,319
half of their garden as males

879
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,398
the folks growing for the fun of getting

880
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,960
high grew colorful flowers with

881
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,119
exceptional bag appeal and great highs

882
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,319
and breeders had seven out of seven

883
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,000
females in a pack

884
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,558

that's humboldtcsi.com

891
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,678
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

892
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,759
growing is so valued by farmers

893
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,720
is because the mycelium networks in the

894
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,119
soil remain

895
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,360
established from year to year and we

896
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,038
know these fungal networks are essential

897
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,278
because they are the nutrient super

898
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,000
highways that extend far and wide in the

899
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,480
substrate

900
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,798
to feed your plants the trouble with

901
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,079
growing in new living soils or blended

902
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,000
cocoa substrates

903
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,398
is that it takes most of the plant's

904
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,919
life just to create these mycelium

905
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,879
highways

906
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,038
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

907
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,080
reduces that time and gets your plant

908
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,079
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

909
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,158
and it's three times the concentration

910
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,278
of the other popular brand in the us

911
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,120
at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal

912
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,000
species selected specifically

913
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,759
for cannabis cultivation dynomica is the

914
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,119
result of 30 years of research and

915
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,599
trials at the volcani

916
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,759
agriculture research institute in israel

917
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,798
it has also been vigorously trialed by

918
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,278
cannabis and food growers across the u.s

919
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,679
dinomyco is now available at grow shops

920

and on amazon in the united states

921
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,600
i love using dynomyco to both speed up

922
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,240
the growth of the mycelium networks in

923
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,719
the soil

924
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,519

shaping fire i am your host shango los

951
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,079
and our guest this week is micro dosing

952
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,000
educator adam bramblidge

953
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,678
so before the fir before the break we

954
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,960
were finishing up with the paul

955
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,320
stamets stack and that is a stack

956
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,278
of psilocybin niacin and lion's mane

957
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,119
and then the protocol which determines

958
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,000
suggestions for how many days to take it

959
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,278
and then how many days

960
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,839
to take a break now um paul stamets

961
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:23,839
because

962
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,599
he is you know a visionary and

963
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,558
incredibly popular that's often the

964
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,558
first

965
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,158
uh protocol that people run into just

966
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,240
because paul stamets is kind of

967
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,200
everywhere as a mushroom god

968
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,079
um but james fatiman is also wildly

969
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,159
respected

970
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,439
among mushroom people and he's an active

971
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,519
teacher um

972
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,000
well spoken and you know pretty

973
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,038
universally respected as well so

974
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,798
his protocol is slightly different than

975
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,960
paul's and so i think it's well

976
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,558
worthwhile to consider his

977
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,000
and then kind of compare and contrast

978
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,319
them so

979
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,480
so let's let's point you in that

980
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,519
direction adam and so

981
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,120
before we compare it to paul stack

982
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,640
if you please just take a moment and

983
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,678
explain uh

984
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,440
james fadiman's uh uh stack

985
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,120
and then protocol and then we'll do the

986
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,960
comparison after

987
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,359
awesome yeah and just a brief background

988
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,720
on dr fatham and about 13 years ago he

989
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,639
wrote a book called the psychedelic

990
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,839
explorers guide which was somewhat of a

991
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,840
guide for

992
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,199
people who wanted to take large dose

993
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,879
journeys and how to safely and

994
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,880
effectively do so

995
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,440
in that book it was the first time that

996
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,519
he mentioned microdosing which was using

997
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,679
small doses of psychedelics

998
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,679
after writing that book he began to get

999
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,159
hundreds of emails from people

1000
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,000
all over the world telling him miracle

1001
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,278
stories about how micro dosing helped

1002
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,919
everything from shingles

1003
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,000
to you name it just about everything so

1004
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,240
that's basically where the modern

1005
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,599
microdosing movement started was 13

1006
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,278
years ago with the psychedelic

1007
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,359
explorer's guide

1008
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,519
dr fatima decided that he needed to come

1009
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,678
up with a protocol

1010
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,960
for people on how to properly dose and

1011
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,320
so his idea

1012
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,960
and his protocol is one day on two days

1013
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,119
off

1014
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,558
now the idea behind this protocol when

1015
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,359
talking to him is he said it was a

1016
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,119
research protocol so this is a protocol

1017
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,959
where he wants to get you back to a

1018
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,518
baseline at some point so

1019
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,079
the first day on is your micro dose day

1020
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,558
this

1021
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,158
the second day is your first day off

1022
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,480
that is your after glow day

1023
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,399
that is your 48 hour effect day you

1024
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,038
still should be getting effects

1025
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,479
from the microdose on your first day off

1026
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,119
now your second day off

1027
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,599
for research purposes is when you return

1028
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,558
to a baseline and are quote unquote

1029
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,158
sober

1030
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,240
and at this point you should be

1031
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,360
journaling as to the differences on your

1032
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,359
sober day

1033
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,599
as opposed to the differences on your on

1034
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,558
day as opposed the differences on your

1035
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,798
afterglow day so again the idea behind

1036
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,798
was he wanted people to reach

1037
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:56,000
back to a baseline on that third day

1038
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:59,278
so does does james faddeman recommend

1039
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,278
um anything else in his stack other than

1040
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,200
the psilocybin for example like

1041
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:06,000
the niacin or the lion's mane or

1042
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,519
something else

1043
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,760
you know i was just watching a new

1044
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,760
podcast with with dr fatima today

1045
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,879
and he he believes strongly in in the

1046
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,839
stacking of

1047
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,398
of mushrooms you know i'm not going to

1048
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,320
say

1049
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,759
per se which one he uh he approves of

1050
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,919
but yeah he definitely

1051
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,679
i think believes in in the stacking of

1052
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,480
mushrooms and what paul's doing

1053
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,800
and what flow state is doing and and you

1054
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,878
know

1055
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,399
um i've definitely heard him hit talk to

1056
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:36,159
that but i'm not going to speak for him

1057
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:39,519
right here so um so if he is doing a

1058
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,079
research protocol um i like the idea

1059
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,960
that brings

1060
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,679
us back to a baseline should we also

1061
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,800
intuit

1062
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,440
into that that um he's not

1063
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,480
necessarily suggesting that this is a

1064
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,039
patient's

1065
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,320
healing protocol or can we make that

1066
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,519
jump and say oh

1067
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,559
you could use his research protocol as a

1068
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,239
patient protocol as well that's a that's

1069
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,279
a really good question and that lends us

1070
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,519
into a third and

1071
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,560
and popular protocol which is the micro

1072
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,400
dosing institute

1073
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,920
protocol developed out of holland and

1074
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,559
that's day on day

1075
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,200
off and the reason they developed that

1076
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,199
protocol

1077
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,838
is because they had a lot of clientele

1078
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,399
telling them that on that third baseline

1079
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:20,000
day

1080
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,920
they dropped back into their deep

1081
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,719
depression and would

1082
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,039
would it be possible to dose again and

1083
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,879
so

1084
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,159
from there this amazing group out of the

1085
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,720
netherlands uh

1086
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,159
developed the protocol of day on day off

1087
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,919
and that's a protocol that we want to

1088
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,960
start getting out there and making more

1089
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,880
popular

1090
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,400
with the world because again there is no

1091
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,280
one protocol

1092
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
that works and you know beyond the

1093
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,240
fatimid protocol

1094
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
and the stamets protocol and the

1095
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,000
microdosing institute protocol

1096
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:49,358
what happens with most clients that i

1097
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,039
work with is

1098
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:52,719
after a month or two they end up

1099
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,279
developing their own protocol

1100
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,439
which is the intuitive protocol and it

1101
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,440
might be different from week to week

1102
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,880
and it might depend on their schedule or

1103
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,599
how they're feeling

1104
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,640
or what's going on in their life so the

1105
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,119
other thing that

1106
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,960
dr fatiman developed was the idea that

1107
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,280
you have to micro dose for at least a

1108
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,280
month before you decide whether or not

1109
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,040
it worked you know there are small

1110
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,960
changes happening every day

1111
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,358
i like to say baby steps or brick by

1112
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,199
brick things are happening so again i

1113
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,440
want to repeat to people that

1114
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,199
you want to give yourself a minimum of a

1115
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,079
month before you decide the positives

1116
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,199
and the negatives

1117
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,320
and what i suggest is maybe week one you

1118
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,118
try one protocol

1119
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,079
we truly try a different protocol we and

1120
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,160
you can really

1121
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,680
mess around with the protocols because i

1122
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,879
know for myself having done this for

1123
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,399
more than three years

1124
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,160
there might be a month where i'm on the

1125
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,920
stands protocol

1126
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,519
and then the next month um due to

1127
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,039
stressors or things happening in my life

1128
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,239
i might switch to the micro dosing

1129
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,719
institute protocol

1130
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,078
which is day on day off and then you

1131
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,679
know there are protocols that we haven't

1132
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,200
even talked about when i'm working with

1133
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,598
clients that are weaning

1134
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,879
uh heavy phartou pharmaceuticals or are

1135
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,720
having addictions

1136
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,400
and that's the fact that over the course

1137
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,078
of the weaning product there are rare

1138
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,440
cases where they might microdose seven

1139
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,280
days a week

1140
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,280
just to help them with the withdrawal in

1141
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,280
the first few weeks but ultimately

1142
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,839
nobody is really micro dosing seven days

1143
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,760
a week

1144
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,960
we don't want a tolerance to build up we

1145
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,640
don't want a mental

1146
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,800
uh thing building up where you think you

1147
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,639
need this and again the days off

1148
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,480
tend to be just as good if not better

1149
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,559
which is really fascinating new medical

1150
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,960
model that we can present to the world

1151
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,880
so what does it feel like to have a

1152
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,440
higher tolerance i mean most of us in

1153
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,920
cannabis

1154
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,440
know what it feels like to build up a

1155
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,960
tolerance to cannabis

1156
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,519
but for folks who are trying to

1157
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,800
recognize it with their micro dosing

1158
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:40,960
what are the signs that they can look

1159
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,960
for

1160
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:44,799
signs they can look for is is after a

1161
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:46,559
month or two

1162
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,880
they're noticing that they're not

1163
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,239
feeling as much of the effects that they

1164
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,320
were feeling at the beginning

1165
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,639
again what's really amazing with

1166
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,280
psilocybin in my personal opinion

1167
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,440
and this is my opinion is that it has a

1168
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,000
fungal intelligence built in

1169
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,159
and if people try to abuse it meaning

1170
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,320
people try to take it in large amounts

1171
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,838
too many times it's going to take those

1172
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,880
people on a very

1173
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,000
not fun journey and when they sober up

1174
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,519
the last thing they're going to think

1175
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,559
about is taking a large dose of

1176
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,119
psilocybin

1177
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,239
it's similar with the small doses if

1178
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,760
people abuse it

1179
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,358
and they take it for two or three months

1180
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,079
straight it's just not going to work

1181
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:23,598
anymore

1182
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,599
it's going to build a tolerance and not

1183
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,240
be effective it's similar with cannabis

1184
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,519
if

1185
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,439
you know you're smoking three times a

1186
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:30,880
day for a month

1187
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,039
at the end of the month you know it's

1188
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,559
going to take you more bong rips

1189
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,800
to get higher than it did at the

1190
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,320
beginning so more than anything i think

1191
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,519
that you know you're probably just not

1192
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,440
getting as much as the

1193
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,920
positive benefits which is uplifting

1194
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,720
energy uplift and mood

1195
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,720
um that kind of stuff so

1196
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,400
i want to ask you a question about

1197
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,240
fungal intelligence and i think it i

1198
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,639
think that one of the reasons why

1199
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,279
your to hear how you talk about it will

1200
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,838
be very

1201
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,480
engaging to people is because you are a

1202
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,480
clear

1203
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,599
spoken scientific person

1204
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,159
who understands the complexities

1205
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,838
of mushrooms and part of its complexity

1206
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,399
sure there's a lot of mushroom

1207
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,400
stuff that happens in the clinic and we

1208
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,880
can we're talking about protocols

1209
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,960
but they're you know along the along the

1210
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,440
sides of the research of

1211
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,240
mushrooms and the experience there is

1212
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,559
this

1213
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,000
fungal intelligence and so would you

1214
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,239
please just address that for

1215
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,519
people who you know either haven't

1216
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,159
considered that part

1217
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,358
or people who really just approach their

1218
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,279
um

1219
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,880
mushrooms as a protocol and as raw

1220
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,800
science to perhaps

1221
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,480
open up a door to that that there might

1222
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,079
be something extra going on here

1223
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,079
yeah i mean anybody that hasn't seen

1224
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,000
fantastic fungi which you can check out

1225
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,240
on amazon which really breaks down

1226
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,079
mushrooms and mycelium and and even what

1227
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,879
they're doing at john hopkins with with

1228
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,200
psilocybin

1229
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,160
treatments you know i really suggest

1230
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,480
checking that out

1231
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,239
but the further you dive into the whole

1232
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,800
of mushrooms and fungus

1233
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:07,118
uh you know the largest fossil ever

1234
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,720
found is i believe 800 million years old

1235
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,280
and it's a mushroom

1236
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:13,519
and basically what we're finding now is

1237
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,720
that plants and animals derived

1238
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:20,559
from mushrooms we know that right so

1239
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:23,919
it's not surprising that these mushrooms

1240
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,719
heal us or help us or our tools or grow

1241
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,079
our brains

1242
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,598
so in my opinion and and other people

1243
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,280
talk about this i am by no means the

1244
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,559
creator of this idea there is an

1245
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,359
intelligence to these

1246
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:37,039
plant medicines to these mushrooms and

1247
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:37,598
i'm sorry but we're never going to be

1248
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:39,599
able to

1249
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,280
figure out the levels of this

1250
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,079
intelligence in a lab

1251
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,720
it's just not quantifiable it's just not

1252
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,839
trackable

1253
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:50,399
it's beyond human brain and so

1254
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,159
when i'm working with people i like to

1255
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,880
remind them that this isn't just a

1256
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,799
nootropic

1257
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,240
or a vitamin or a supplement like this

1258
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,160
is a sacred tool

1259
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,399
i remind them first of all that you are

1260
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,559
the medicine we are the medicine

1261
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,920
and it is a tool that is going to help

1262
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,759
us so

1263
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,280
again there is an intelligence to these

1264
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,400
mushrooms that i

1265
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,720
couldn't even properly put into words

1266
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,920
and if people are humble enough to

1267
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,199
believe that

1268
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,838
and to try um i really feel like it's

1269
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,838
something that is not only going to

1270
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,559
change people's inner workings but also

1271
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,719
our planet

1272
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,400
you know i've i'm a big fan of paul

1273
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,679
stamets and i agree with him i think the

1274
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,358
answers to

1275
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,118
global warming and everything that we're

1276
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:32,000
facing right now is mushrooms i'm

1277
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,079
talking about

1278
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,358
mushrooms to eat up plastic mushrooms to

1279
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,920
eat up garbage

1280
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:38,960
mushrooms to clean up uh chernobyl and

1281
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,159
toxic waste

1282
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,679
and you know also for our own personal

1283
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,920
health you know paul stamets figured out

1284
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,879
a way to use mushroom extract to save

1285
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,358
the bees

1286
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,200
from b colony collapse and that's

1287
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:53,279
another thing he says about microdosing

1288
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,799
paul stamets believes microdosing

1289
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,720
is how we're going to crack the code to

1290
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,960
solving the problems of the future

1291
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,919
he believes that by people microdosing

1292
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,358
more often

1293
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,960
creating new neural pathways and

1294
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,318
thinking outside of the default mode

1295
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,159
network that we're going to be able to

1296
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,318
solve these problems

1297
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,838
that we haven't been able to solve and

1298
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,400
in my personal opinion that

1299
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,759
fungal intelligence was part of the

1300
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,079
mayan tradition

1301
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,000
the aztec the egyptian all these

1302
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,240
traditions they've been using these

1303
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,159
mushrooms and these plant medicines to

1304
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,239
get intelligence and figure out

1305
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,239
how to do many things from probably

1306
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,919
building their pyramids to

1307
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:29,358
you name it so again there is an

1308
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,240
intelligence that we're never going to

1309
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,440
be able

1310
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,559
to put into human words i recently saw a

1311
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,079
meme that i really

1312
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,400
uh enjoyed and it said um psychedelics

1313
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,440
is

1314
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,079
nature trying to speak with us and um

1315
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,000
and i like i like that sentiment and you

1316
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,119
know there there are a lot of people who

1317
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,800
do experiment with micro dosing

1318
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,720
that may not immediately embrace the

1319
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,560
fungal intelligence part

1320
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,318
i've got friends who who at the

1321
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,318
beginning didn't really

1322
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,838
care about that part they wanted to

1323
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,318
microdose because

1324
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,000
they write software and they wanted to

1325
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,440
you know be able to

1326
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,119
envision the software differently and

1327
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,639
and and see more big pictures so they

1328
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,599
started taking that to be to be

1329
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,239
better at their job and a couple months

1330
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,440
into it

1331
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,879
you can see them evolve into you know

1332
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,639
having some kind of respect for the

1333
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,920
fungal intelligence and and that's kind

1334
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,480
of funny right because

1335
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,159
regardless of who you are that you bring

1336
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,920
to the psilocybin

1337
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,159
around your belief in fungal

1338
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,440
intelligence it kind of gets

1339
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:38,239
done to you anyway

1340
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,119
yeah it's it's fascinating you know it's

1341
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,639
you don't

1342
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,760
yeah it it yeah i don't i'm speechless

1343
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:45,358
right now because the

1344
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,119
the long and short of it is it has a

1345
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:50,159
unique relationship

1346
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,720
with everybody that it works with and

1347
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,799
i am blown away day-to-day with how many

1348
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,318
messages i get from clients

1349
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,400
that are improving their lives and

1350
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,239
improving their lives in ways where

1351
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,358
now their wife wants to microdose now

1352
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:02,559
they want to get their daughter

1353
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:03,920
microdosing and off of her

1354
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,480
antidepressants

1355
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,519
and it's just an amazing spiral of

1356
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,119
people

1357
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,800
healing themselves and then helping

1358
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,880
others to heal

1359
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,640
so let's uh before we go to our second

1360
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,680
break let's talk a little bit about

1361
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:20,799
um individualized medicine

1362
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:23,039
so you've mentioned a couple times about

1363
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,839
um you know how people tend to get

1364
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,079
started

1365
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:28,159
and they you know they they're learning

1366
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,119
from somebody whether it be a friend or

1367
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,960
an educator

1368
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,119
or a book or wherever and so they'll

1369
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,240
start following a protocol that has been

1370
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,318
recommended to them

1371
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:42,559
and over time they start to

1372
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,400
do the intuitive protocol you called it

1373
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,000
so would you talk a little bit about

1374
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,440
that transition

1375
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,559
from a protocol that we've been taught

1376
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,679
to a protocol that we've designed

1377
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:58,559
ourselves i'm sure that working with

1378
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,879
as many students as you have that you

1379
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,960
you have perhaps a few best practices

1380
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,039
for adapting a protocol you've been

1381
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,519
given into one that you've made yourself

1382
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,880
yeah absolutely and and beyond the the

1383
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,039
protocols we know

1384
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,640
you know i also suggest for the clients

1385
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,559
that they stack some very important

1386
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,960
things in their life like exercise you

1387
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,639
know they reduce the amount of alcohol

1388
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,599
little things like that so you know the

1389
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:26,159
stacking of exercise i think is actually

1390
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,200
hugely beneficial to to people as well

1391
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,799
and i just wanted to

1392
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:32,799
to mention that um and i forgot

1393
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,079
the answer sure i'm looking i'm looking

1394
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,480
for best practices

1395
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,119
for going from a set protocol to an

1396
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,760
individualized intuitive protocol

1397
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,318
yeah best practices so again you know i

1398
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,119
would say

1399
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,800
in that first month that it's nice to

1400
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,440
try out the protocols that have been

1401
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,359
developed

1402
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,039
because they work but what i see over

1403
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:54,078
time is after that first month

1404
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,719
people naturally get into this intuitive

1405
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,079
space

1406
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,480
and in the same way that you talked

1407
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,079
about people naturally

1408
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,639
connect with the fungal intelligence

1409
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,800
over time i think micro dosing

1410
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,759
makes people more intuitive it makes

1411
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,440
people more

1412
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,359
confident makes them follow their

1413
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,318
intuition so it's a natural

1414
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,639
occurrence it's not that there's a sop

1415
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:15,039
for

1416
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,879
um you know how best to create your own

1417
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,318
intuitive protocol it's something that

1418
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,160
is unique again

1419
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,000
to the individual some people might

1420
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,399
develop it in week three some people

1421
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,039
might develop it in month three

1422
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,720
so more than anything it's a natural

1423
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,800
process doesn't happen

1424
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,759
at the same time for everyone and i

1425
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,839
think developing an intuitive protocol

1426
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,440
over time is something that can be uh

1427
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,838
powerful for the person

1428
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,200
and again you know we're asking people

1429
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:46,159
to stack exercise stack things like yoga

1430
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,719
breath work uh healthy diet all kinds of

1431
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:48,639
stuff so

1432
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,639
there are a lot of things weighing in to

1433
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,960
to help out that micro dosing

1434
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,879
but people tend to find that protocol on

1435
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,400
their own over time it's not that i'm

1436
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,160
coaching them in any way

1437
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,680
how to find them like i said i think

1438
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:00,559
that the microdosing makes them more

1439
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,399
intuitive

1440
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,039
you know you spoke of your your friends

1441
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,880
that were taking it to do better at work

1442
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,159
that's probably somebody that should

1443
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,519
microdose lsd

1444
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:14,078
lsd is really good for focus for coding

1445
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:14,960
for staying on task for being outward in

1446
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,318
the world

1447
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,800
phil simon's a little different so

1448
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,558
simon's more inward it's more uh

1449
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,079
giving you the the ability to work on

1450
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,640
yourself to

1451
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,519
to create but it's not as focused

1452
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,920
outward so

1453
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,960
something i would uh just mention to

1454
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,119
everybody is

1455
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,480
you know i see psilocybin micro dosing

1456
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,519
is more of an inner

1457
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,519
journey whereas lsd is more of something

1458
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,199
people are using for focus

1459
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:41,280
like you said in silicon valley and

1460
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,279
coding jobs where they need to stay up

1461
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,480
for 16 hours and think outside of the

1462
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,760
box

1463
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,240
well that's really interesting all right

1464
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,520
so last thing before we go to the second

1465
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:50,719
set well you know i'm sure that you work

1466
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,639
with some people

1467
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,399
who have got trepidation right they're

1468
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:55,598
actually uncomfortable with all of this

1469
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,720
i mean i'm very comfortable talking

1470
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,000
about it now because

1471
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:00,799
you know we were doing this stuff

1472
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,119
recreationally back in you know college

1473
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,160
all those all those years ago and so i'm

1474
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,200
pretty comfortable with it but but there

1475
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,399
are a lot of people who

1476
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,879
approach this as an adult and it's been

1477
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,720
demonized and taboo their whole life but

1478
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,240
they do want relief or they do want to

1479
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,480
connect with their

1480
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,239
you know their spiritual side or for

1481
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,760
whatever that draws them

1482
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,358
they're coming to this and they're

1483
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,960
reading all this good stuff but

1484
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:24,480
but in their heart of hearts they're you

1485
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,119
know they got some trepidation

1486
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,039
um what do you offer folks to kind of uh

1487
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,400
soothe them and and help them

1488
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:34,239
get their mindset correct

1489
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,079
it's a good question i mean i like to

1490
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,439
remind people that mushrooms don't know

1491
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,400
they're illegal

1492
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,480
and uh you know the fact that uh

1493
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,920
somebody can tell us

1494
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,599
we can't put something that grows

1495
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,400
naturally from god's green earth into

1496
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,680
our system

1497
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,240
is kind of outrageous um if people have

1498
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,960
a really tough time with the legality or

1499
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,959
the idea that a mushroom is a drug um i

1500
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,920
tend to direct them to the immortality

1501
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,599
key

1502
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,000
a new book that just came out where

1503
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,760
they've basically proven that uh

1504
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,760
you know back in greek times they were

1505
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,280
doing this rite of passage that involved

1506
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,800
year got which is where lsd came from

1507
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,200
socrates plato democracy theater

1508
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,599
the olympics everything developed out of

1509
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,598
these psychedelic rites of passage

1510
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,960
and basically when the romans took over

1511
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,280
one of their leaders

1512
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,280
um made it illegal for these ceremonies

1513
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,200
anymore and you were punishable by death

1514
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,359
and within 20 30 years

1515
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:31,358
they basically got it out of all of

1516
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,598
history and the way that we've proven it

1517
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:36,400
now is they've been able to

1518
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,079
do dna testing on the goblets that

1519
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,160
they've found in these ancient altar

1520
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,160
sites and they've they've proven

1521
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,279
that they were tripping in these

1522
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,679
ceremonies

1523
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,040
so i just remind people that saying that

1524
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,598
mushrooms is a drug is

1525
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:52,000
is uh or illegal is more of something

1526
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,880
that's happened you know since 1972 when

1527
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,880
nixon

1528
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,358
created the whole idea of this drug war

1529
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,800
and i just tried to ease their

1530
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,159
ease their attention on it and you know

1531
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,880
what to be honest with you if somebody's

1532
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,118
really worried

1533
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,640
about it i just don't work with them and

1534
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,960
when they're ready

1535
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:07,838
um they're ready and i don't like to

1536
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,440
force

1537
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,440
anything on them you know dr fatima

1538
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,679
likes to say if anyone asks

1539
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,480
him if they should do a large dose

1540
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:16,480
journey

1541
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,000
he says no and then they say why do you

1542
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,440
say no and he said because if you have

1543
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,239
to ask me if you should do it you're not

1544
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,159
ready

1545
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,318
um so there are all kinds of different

1546
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,078
ways to to look at things

1547
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:27,920
right on good i really appreciate that

1548
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,680
and if uh if you are listening while

1549
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,159
you're driving or riding your bike or

1550
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,358
whatever

1551
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:36,000
and you want to remember the immortality

1552
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,679
key book um there will be a link to it

1553
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,760
on the shaping fire website

1554
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,199
uh when you get back to your computer

1555
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,760
all right so with that let's go ahead

1556
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,838
and take

1557
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,599
our second short break and be right back

1558
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,599
you are listening to shaping fire and my

1559
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,269
guest today is micro dosing educator

[Music]

1562
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,480
while i love growing under the sun

1563
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,200
there's a lot of good reasons to grow

1564
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,039
indoors

1565
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,879
and if you're like most folks you want a

1566
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,880
lighting source that grows high yielding

1567
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,640
healthy plants without using excessive

1568
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,640
amounts of electricity

1569
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,759
bios lighting creates biological

1570
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:07,358
lighting solutions

1571
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,000
that brings the natural brilliance of

1572
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,000
the outdoors into your grow room

1573
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,679
bios lighting has the attributes that i

1574
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,639
look for in a horticultural lighting

1575
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,480
solution

1576
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,078
i've bought those cheap lights online

1577
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,440
and they're difficult to work with and

1578
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,400
fail in no time

1579
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,480
in contrast my bios led light is

1580
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,760
industrial grade to last a long time

1581
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,280
it is ip66 wet rated so little foliar

1582
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,040
overspray won't harm it

1583
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,040
it is easy to clean without taking it

1584
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,679
down and of course the most important

1585
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:36,079
aspect

1586
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:38,558
is built for the exact light spectrum i

1587
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,359
want for great yielding healthy cannabis

1588
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,640
plants

1589
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,960
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

1590
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,118
rigs look badass too

1591
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,720
many horticultural led lighting systems

1592
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,280
are based on irrelevant performance

1593
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:48,959
metrics

1594
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,440
and people love to argue online about

1595
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,440
these numbers i prefer to judge on par

1596
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,079
photon efficiency and how happy my

1597
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,400
plants are and the bios lights exceed my

1598
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,640
expectations in these categories

1599
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,039
bios lights have an optimized broad

1600
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,078
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis

1601
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:05,920
and plant growth

1602
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,920
while also providing the ideal

1603
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,760
conditions for superior par

1604
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,159
efficacy and a comfortable visual

1605
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,960
experience i also love their attentive

1606
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:17,199
and over-educated customer service folks

1607
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,119
bios starts with a team of biologists

1608
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:19,919
before getting the electrical engineers

1609
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,680
involved

1610
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,920
they have studied how light impacts

1611
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,598
cannabis plants and devised an overall

1612
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,960
strategy that works

1613
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,760

educated

1625
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,960
it is increasingly important to avoid

1626
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,640
the use of chemical pesticides when

1627
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,318
cultivating cannabis

1628
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,000
beneficial insects have been used for

1629
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,318
decades by the greenhouse vegetable

and ornamental plant industry and today

1631
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:05,920
many cannabis cultivators

1632
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,599
are moving from sprays and chemicals to

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,480
due to stringent thc testing

1674
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:30,239
requirements

1675
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,760
brother seth and eric crawford continue

1676
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,719
to release seeds to hemp farmers that

1677
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,559
will be legal

1678
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,879
no matter how you grow them or when you

1679
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,960
test them these new varieties from

1680
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,480
oregon cbd seeds have substantial

1681
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,920
amounts of cbdv

1682
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,079
cbgv cbcv and thcv

1683
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,599
while always staying below the 0.3

1684
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,760
percent thc limit

1685
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,680
and guaranteeing compliant crops for

1686
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,520
farmers every time

1687
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,879
also these new varieties cannot be

1688
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:56,159
pollinated by your neighbor's

1689
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,960
uncontrolled pollen

1690
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,519
or a rogue male in your own crop either

1691
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,559
oregon cbd seeds are non-gmo certified

1692
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,280
too

1693
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,599
oregon cbd seeds was founded and funded

1694
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,319
in

1695
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,480
2015 by seth and eric maxing out their

1696
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:11,440
personal credit cards without outside

1697
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,119
investment

1698
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,400
they continue to refuse outside

1699
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,079
investment that would change their

1700
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,720
company culture

1701
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,000
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

1702
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,199
their research farms for

1703
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,358
local food banks literally tons of food

1704
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:26,239
they also give away tens of thousands of

1705
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:29,039
pounds of r

1706
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,318
d flour to patients as their company

1707
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,159
began to succeed

1708
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,000
seth and eric started donating money to

1709
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,239
the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber

1710
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,920

welcome back you are listening to

1738
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,358
shaping fire i am your host shango los

1739
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,358
and our guest this week is micro dosing

1740
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:43,039
educator adam bramledge

1741
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:45,279
so um regardless of what protocol you

1742
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:49,039
decide to go with

1743
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:52,400
in your journey you know most people

1744
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:56,000
run into the same handful of

1745
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:58,639
challenges or or

1746
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,039
attributes of micro dosing and it's good

1747
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:01,838
to know

1748
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:02,159
about your possibility of running into

1749
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:04,798
them

1750
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,558
in advance so i've made a short list of

1751
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,960
things that people have asked me about

1752
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,000
or i've experienced with psilocybin

1753
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,039
and we're going to go through those with

1754
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,159
adam now so that you know you can have a

1755
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:18,318
full picture of what this looks like

1756
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:20,399
and you can know what you might run into

1757
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,039
and you'll have some solutions

1758
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,798
in advance so adam i think that one of

1759
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,358
the biggest issues that we have for

1760
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:27,039
folks

1761
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,358
are people trying to get the right

1762
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:32,558
dosage and during the first set

1763
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,358
um you you know we talked about the the

1764
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,720
starting

1765
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,480
low and increasing slowly and uh people

1766
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,358
probably get that but but i mean like

1767
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,318
specifically

1768
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:42,880
measuring doses to make sure that you

1769
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:44,960
get

1770
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,559
uh the proper amount these numb these

1771
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,079
these weights that we're talking about

1772
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,720
are very specific

1773
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,519
so um what do you recommend to your

1774
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:52,879
clients to

1775
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:54,480
to make sure that they are actually

1776
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,680
getting the dose that they're trying to

1777
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,280
get

1778
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:58,798
yeah that's a great question so if

1779
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,880
you're micro dosing

1780
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,039
to all the listeners out there you need

1781
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,039
to go get yourself a nice digital scale

1782
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,639
something small that reads in the tenths

1783
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,719
and the hundredths of a gram

1784
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:10,480
and we need to stop just nibbling little

1785
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:11,838
pieces off the stem and the cap and we

1786
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,000
need to really

1787
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,599
document how much we're taking so that

1788
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,199
we know what's our effective dose

1789
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,920
because again it's unique for everyone

1790
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:19,759
so again

1791
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,880
you're going to want a coffee grinder

1792
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,760
because what you're going to want to do

1793
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,920
is you're going to want to

1794
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,200
grind up the dried fruiting body you're

1795
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,480
going to want to make sure that that

1796
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,960
dried fruiting body is cracker dry

1797
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,559
we're talking super dry okay you don't

1798
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,000
want to make sure there's any moisture

1799
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,079
or mold that could grow

1800
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,119
within these mushrooms once it's cracker

1801
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:42,400
dry you blend it up into a powder

1802
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,519
and then you're literally weighing out

1803
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,039
and if you're concerned if you're

1804
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,000
someone who has a low tolerance for

1805
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:47,679
substances

1806
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,960
then maybe you start out at 25

1807
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,399
milligrams and that means that's

1808
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:55,199
.025 on a scale

1809
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,079
so it's a very very small amount i then

1810
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,159
recommend

1811
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,079
that you get a capsule and you put it in

1812
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,879
a capsule i think it's a lot easier on

1813
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,559
your stomach

1814
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,760
if it's in a capsule than just putting

1815
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:08,400
it on your tongue maybe even a smoothie

1816
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,319
so that is probably the best way to do

1817
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,358
it but we really need to take the time

1818
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:14,719
and the care

1819
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:15,598
to get a scale to weigh it out i suggest

1820
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,439
grinding it up

1821
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,200
why i think grinding it up helps is i

1822
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,798
think it breaks it down

1823
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,639
a little bit more for your system and

1824
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:24,239
it's already more broken down and more

1825
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,000
available for you than if you were just

1826
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,798
a munch the fruiting body

1827
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,239
so that's my biggest suggestion is is

1828
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:33,039
getting that scale

1829
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,798
again 50 milligrams is probably the good

1830
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,880
place to start for most people

1831
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,559
if you're really concerned the lowest

1832
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,119
i've ever heard still having an effect

1833
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:44,480
is 20 milligrams you can start there

1834
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,400
um if you're a regular psychonaut and

1835
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,798
you're like 50 just doesn't sound like a

1836
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,760
big enough number for me start at 100.

1837
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:53,199
um but once people start getting over

1838
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,240
200 milligrams

1839
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:58,000
it's usually not a micro dose

1840
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,679
for most people some people have a

1841
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,358
higher tolerance and

1842
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,519
some people might think that 200

1843
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:05,440
milligram to 400 milligram is that mini

1844
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:07,280
dose range i know it is for me

1845
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,440
um and that's another way that you could

1846
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,839
use it but if you're going to start slow

1847
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,639
uh you start low and go slow you need to

1848
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:14,400
get a scale

1849
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,639
you need to grind it up you need to make

1850
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,280
sure that everything is cracker dry

1851
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:20,159
and you know be logging in a journal you

1852
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,920
know day one

1853
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,519
i took 25 milligrams no effect day two i

1854
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,159
took 50 milligrams

1855
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:29,838
noticed improvement in my mood so again

1856
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:31,358
these are all things that people need to

1857
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:34,880
take upon themselves

1858
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:38,639
and really get scientific about it

1859
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:42,000
if somebody receives their mushrooms

1860
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:45,519
and they are not bone dry is it as

1861
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,838
simple as just leaving the ziploc bag

1862
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:51,199
open in a cool dark place for a few days

1863
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:53,119
and just letting them dry out

1864
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,358
or should we use something more specific

1865
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,280
than that

1866
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,119
yeah i mean it all depends on your

1867
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,119
environment and where you live

1868
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:03,280
and what to do i know some people will

1869
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,960
even use a dehydrator

1870
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,480
i don't know i think the best thing to

1871
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,240
do is yeah keep the bag

1872
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,719
open keep it in a place where it

1873
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:13,679
breathes and it gets air

1874
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:15,199
there are packets you can add that help

1875
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:16,960
suck the moisture out

1876
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,480
you even see them in cannabis so there's

1877
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,400
a lot of different ways

1878
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,000
and things you can do to to get the last

1879
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,559
of that that moisture out

1880
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,960
all right so when measuring doses there

1881
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,519
is one more variable and that's the fact

1882
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,880
that

1883
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,798
there are a lot of different types of

1884
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,240
philosophy mushrooms that contain

1885
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:37,440
psilocybin

1886
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:41,679
and they have differentiating

1887
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:44,480
potencies um i normally act

1888
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,358
like unless unless i'm having penis envy

1889
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,838
mushrooms

1890
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,358
i i just assume that everything else is

1891
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:50,960
pretty much going to be the same and i

1892
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:52,400
just dose as i will

1893
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,480
but is there something more

1894
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,440
sophisticated than that that we should

1895
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,119
be aware of

1896
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:03,200
for adjusting our dosing weight

1897
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:06,000
to the potency of the mushroom

1898
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,358
variety that we are taking yeah that's a

1899
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,760
great question and there are a few

1900
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,920
mushroom varieties out there that are

1901
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,359
uh way more potent than others you know

1902
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,760
penis envy is

1903
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:17,838
is the big name that um i'm always

1904
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,119
hearing and talking about

1905
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:24,000
and i just don't know that penis envy

1906
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,760
is um a good one for everyone to micro

1907
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,159
dose because it's too strong

1908
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,440
um i know i took one time what i thought

1909
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:31,358
was a penis envy

1910
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,039
micro dose and it took turned into a

1911
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:35,279
full on uh

1912
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:37,039
large dose so again if you're going to

1913
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,798
micro dose with penis envy i'm i'm

1914
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,799
guessing you're using very very small

1915
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,798
amounts and and you should be

1916
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,480
uh more careful than with other

1917
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,960
varieties i know i believe it's

1918
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,079
cyanescence and acirens

1919
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,159
i didn't say that right but there are a

1920
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,640
couple other varieties that grow wild

1921
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,920
that are

1922
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:55,440
super super strong and potent too um

1923
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,358
most people don't even eat them for

1924
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,960
large doses so you know

1925
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,558
the internet is a great resource to

1926
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,119
check out all the different varieties

1927
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,720
and and

1928
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,559
what they're good at but you know most

1929
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,318
people that i'm working with i'm

1930
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,200
suggesting that they're using a very

1931
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:09,358
mellow

1932
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:11,279
um and stable variety a lot of people

1933
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:15,838
are using golden teachers

1934
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:18,798
uh you know thai

1935
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,759
burmese couple different varieties but

1936
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,079
penis envy and

1937
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,280
and the stronger end mushrooms are

1938
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,640
probably mushrooms you

1939
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,798
you would want to save for the large

1940
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:28,239
dose journeys although

1941
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:30,480
i know there are groups out there that

1942
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:32,639
do like to micro dose with the penis

1943
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,559
envy so it's all personal preference

1944
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:35,679
um but yeah you need to be aware that

1945
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,920
some varieties

1946
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,000
of philosophy are much stronger than

1947
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,358
others and this is a good argument too

1948
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,079
for knowing your source as well uh you

1949
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:45,519
know it's a good

1950
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,519
sign when the person that you're

1951
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:48,400
receiving the mushrooms from can also

1952
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,280
tell you

1953
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,559
the variety and uh you know feel like

1954
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,200
they're close-ish

1955
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,760
to the cultivator um because while

1956
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,838
there's

1957
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,440
there isn't nearly the kind of abuse

1958
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,639
with mushrooms as there are

1959
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,920
with um different sorts of intoxicants

1960
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,318
and other drugs

1961
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,039
um it's still good to be close to your

1962
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:09,199
farmer

1963
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,240
uh both energetically and so that you

1964
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:14,480
can be aware of what the variety is

1965
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:16,399
yeah when i was in cannabis as a farmer

1966
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,519
um you know we used to always say no

1967
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,039
your farmer

1968
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:21,038
you know your your medicine and where it

1969
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,799
comes from and it's the same with

1970
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,640
with your mushrooms and again i think

1971
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:25,280
the easiest way to do it is to grow it

1972
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:27,199
yourself

1973
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,400
and there are really amazing programs

1974
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:31,118
out there and

1975
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,240
ways that for you know 50 to 100 people

1976
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,640
can grow

1977
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:35,919
their own mushrooms have a relationship

1978
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,400
with the fungus

1979
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,280
and grow enough under their bed in a

1980
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,079
shoe box just

1981
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,839
to supply them for a full year so the

1982
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,960
best way to really do it is to learn how

1983
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,038
to do it yourself

1984
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,480
and know exactly where it's coming from

1985
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,720
and if you're not set up in a place to

1986
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,440
do that yeah you absolutely have to know

1987
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,959
who's doing it how it's working should

1988
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,200
be vetted

1989
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,559
that type of stuff so you have to be

1990
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:59,358
careful and if you're getting it from

1991
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,119
somebody

1992
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:03,440
and he can't tell you whether it's penis

1993
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,838
envy or a thai variety

1994
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,880
or burmese or what it is then you

1995
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:07,599
probably shouldn't get it from that

1996
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,720
person

1997
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:13,920
it's really fantastic to see so many uh

1998
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:15,838
home cultivation classes uh showing up

1999
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,159
all over the place and i haven't taken

2000
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:20,558
enough of them to compare one to another

2001
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:22,078
but i'm just glad to see the access to

2002
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,640
that information

2003
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:27,039
is i mean hell nearly ubiquitous now i

2004
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:28,879
think that's a good sign

2005
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,079
yeah you know people always talk to me

2006
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,680
as someone who pivoted out of the

2007
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,160
cannabis space well aren't you worried

2008
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:34,399
about

2009
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,759
big pharma and what about corporation

2010
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,798
coming in and

2011
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,200
and privatizing psilocybin and to me

2012
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:40,798
again

2013
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,960
it's almost laughable because the

2014
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:46,079
reality is everybody can

2015
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:48,880
grow their own mushrooms big pharma

2016
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,480
big big capital big corporations they

2017
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,079
can't stop people

2018
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,679
they can't stop the power of these

2019
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,039
mushrooms the ability to educate

2020
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:57,118
everybody how to grow these

2021
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,559
on their own and growing mushrooms in

2022
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,160
your home is easier than growing

2023
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,760
cannabis for eight months out in the sun

2024
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,598
i'll tell you that much so

2025
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,520
the long and short of it is before we

2026
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,119
legalize and make it available for

2027
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:08,559
companies like my own to provide you

2028
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,720
micro dosing products

2029
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,880
we have to decriminalize first which

2030
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:15,439
means we need to give everybody

2031
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,240
at home the ability to grow gift and

2032
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,400
gather

2033
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:20,479
their own mushrooms if you're allowed to

2034
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,960
legally grow your own mushrooms and

2035
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,358
provide them to your friends and family

2036
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,960
uh then you don't have to go to the

2037
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:28,078
pharmacy and buy the overpriced

2038
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,240
psilocybin

2039
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,240
and then big corporation and big pharma

2040
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,759
doesn't have that power so again i'm not

2041
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,679
worried about it i think

2042
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,520
the most important thing moving forward

2043
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:38,558
is that we decriminalize before we

2044
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:40,159
legalize

2045
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,079
for those of you listeners out there who

2046
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:44,000
are interested in this decriminalized

2047
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,720
nature is a great group to get involved

2048
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,880
in

2049
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:48,000
and again we need to continue to

2050
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,920
decriminalize

2051
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,838
so that people aren't persecuted and put

2052
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,798
in jail if they can't afford to buy the

2053
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:55,519
legal products

2054
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:56,960
here here so let's talk about tummy

2055
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:00,559
aches and nausea

2056
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,760
certainly with larger doses macro doses

2057
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:06,400
uh tummy aches and nausea as

2058
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,280
the fruiting body of the mushroom is

2059
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,119
processed

2060
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:14,000
in the gut um really is um

2061
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,559
uncomfortable for a lot of folks and

2062
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,039
when i

2063
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,599
first experimented with with micro

2064
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,400
dosing

2065
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,480
at at point one um i figured oh it's

2066
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,880
such a small amount i won't feel

2067
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,679
you know any nausea at all and yet i

2068
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,160
still feel

2069
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:30,000
a little bit of constriction in my gut

2070
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:32,399
and a little bit of nausea

2071
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,358
and some people experience it even more

2072
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,519
than that

2073
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:36,639
so i'm curious to know what your

2074
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,679
experience is

2075
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:42,719
with both how

2076
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:46,399
common nausea is

2077
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,118
at these low low micro doses and if you

2078
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,880
have any

2079
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,400
tips or tricks for decreasing that

2080
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,960
experience

2081
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,760
yeah can i ask you first did you blend

2082
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,599
up your

2083
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,839
dose and was it in a capsule or were you

2084
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:01,079
taking it on the tongue and tasting it

2085
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:02,239
how were you ingesting it was a

2086
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,280
non-blended

2087
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:08,479
up 0.1 put in a capsule

2088
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,599
so there was a there was a firm small

2089
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,559
mushroom body in the capsule okay okay

2090
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,680
interesting yeah you know for me um and

2091
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,039
i suggest again

2092
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:20,000
between the 100 and 150 ish milligram

2093
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:22,000
range

2094
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,158
for people starting i don't get a lot of

2095
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,319
reports of tummy aches

2096
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,000
and again the suggestion is to grind it

2097
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,759
up and put it in a capsule

2098
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,520
the other thing is you gotta i suggest

2099
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,198
taking it with with food you know having

2100
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,040
some food in your system so

2101
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,719
was there food in your system was there

2102
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,960
not yeah definitely not that's

2103
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:41,679
interesting i was actually taught to

2104
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,079
take it on an empty stomach so here's a

2105
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,158
myth

2106
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:45,759
that i got you know in college all those

2107
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:48,079
years ago that's not right anymore will

2108
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,520
you speak more to that

2109
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:50,719
well it's not that it's not right

2110
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,400
because i think that there's plenty of

2111
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,000
people that take it on an empty stomach

2112
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:55,838
and i i'm someone that intermittent

2113
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,880
fasts almost daily i don't really do

2114
01:08:55,838 --> 01:08:59,679
breakfast so i'm

2115
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,798
also kind of taking an empty stomach i

2116
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,279
don't recommend taking

2117
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,640
an empty stomach for anyone that doesn't

2118
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,679
want to maybe get rushes

2119
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,119
of feeling more of a mini dose you know

2120
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,399
if you don't have food in your system

2121
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:12,559
it's going to hit you

2122
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,079
harder so i think in college the reason

2123
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,839
that we weren't trying to eat is we

2124
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:17,838
wanted to trip harder we wanted to feel

2125
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:20,880
we wanted to feel it more

2126
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:22,399
but no i i suggest that most people

2127
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,600
if their routine is to have food in

2128
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,278
their stomach in the morning then they

2129
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,039
need to have food in their stomach

2130
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,199
in the morning or it could help them

2131
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:30,798
feel uncomfortable

2132
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,399
the other thing is i think these other

2133
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:33,278
mushrooms that you stack together

2134
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,198
especially in

2135
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,440
in the flow state blend when we stack

2136
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,278
chaga and cordyceps in maitake which

2137
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,798
chaga and mataki are good for the immune

2138
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,199
system i think that those

2139
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:44,960
also help with the nausea because i

2140
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,318
don't get any reports from my clients

2141
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,920
with an upset stomach

2142
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,319
nor do i hear much about an upset

2143
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:52,239
stomach with the paul stamet stack so

2144
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,880
again the upset stomach could be an

2145
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:58,079
issue of maybe no food in your belly

2146
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,520
um or maybe even your microdose is a

2147
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:00,960
little too high

2148
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,719
and then for people that just have an

2149
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,399
aversion to psilocybin and it's just

2150
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,640
always given them a tummy ache

2151
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:07,920
again after capsulizing it and grinding

2152
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,320
it up

2153
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,199
maybe take it with some ginger and have

2154
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,119
a ginger tea

2155
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:14,960
or eat a ginger chew or something like

2156
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:16,399
that and get some ginger into your

2157
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,520
system to potentially help your stomach

2158
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:19,759
as well

2159
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,440
um after hearing that little bit it's

2160
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,520
like i stacked the wrong

2161
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,559
things to do right you know it's like i

2162
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,800
didn't grind

2163
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,800
um the mushroom i took it on an empty

2164
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,239
stomach i mean it's like all right

2165
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,480
this is going to be oh and i didn't

2166
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:34,000
stack it with other healthy mushrooms

2167
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,198
even though i have five defenders in my

2168
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,158
house i never thought to put them

2169
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:37,919
together

2170
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:39,359
so that that could radically change my

2171
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,520
experience so that's great

2172
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:44,238
um let's talk about a significant

2173
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,400
sensitivity to psilocybin because

2174
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:48,519
while it's a very very small number of

2175
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,079
people there are people who are

2176
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:52,480
hypersensitive

2177
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,439
and would you talk a little bit about

2178
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:56,319
you know

2179
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:58,799
how common that is and just to reinforce

2180
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:01,759
the start slow because i find that that

2181
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,360
the the finding for people to start low

2182
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,760
and slow is one of the hardest things to

2183
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,279
get folks to actually do

2184
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,800
yeah i think if you've never taken a

2185
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:10,800
psychedelic before you're

2186
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,079
absolutely the person we're talking to

2187
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,400
when we say start low

2188
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:15,519
and go slow you know for those of us

2189
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,519
that have had

2190
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,040
more experiences you've got more room

2191
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,280
for error you can handle it

2192
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:23,119
if that large dose experience kicks in

2193
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:24,800
or the mini dose you might actually

2194
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,640
strap on your seatbelt and enjoy the

2195
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,119
ride but for beginners

2196
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,679
you really got to take your time and

2197
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:31,760
these

2198
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,440
psychedelics even in small amounts are

2199
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,199
non-specific amplifiers

2200
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:36,960
and the reason so much healing in my

2201
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:38,238
opinion happens with the microdosing of

2202
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,039
psilocybin

2203
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:42,238
is all of the traumas or emotions or

2204
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,560
things that we've buried

2205
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,919
maybe even since childhood that we have

2206
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,679
failed to deal with

2207
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,760
are brought to light almost like a

2208
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,679
spotlight is shined on it and you can't

2209
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,280
hide it anymore and you're forced

2210
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,520
to deal with it and you're forced to do

2211
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:58,880
the work and that's why so many people

2212
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:01,760
are benefiting from this micro dosing of

2213
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,119
psilocybin especially in regards to

2214
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,039
helping many of my clients

2215
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:09,599
get off of uh 20 even 30 years at times

2216
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,238
of antidepressants and anti-anxieties

2217
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,840
and

2218
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,439
every pill under the sun that you can

2219
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,000
think of so

2220
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,439
we mentioned at the top that you are not

2221
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,439
a medical doctor

2222
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:20,799
and we always recommend that people talk

2223
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:23,119
to their doctors

2224
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,400
before you know going down these paths

2225
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:24,960
and hopefully you've got a doctor that

2226
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:27,359
you can be

2227
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,158
this frank with even though most of us

2228
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:29,839
don't

2229
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:31,359
um but i say this just to set up the

2230
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,079
question adam are there

2231
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:34,960
are there any particular pre-existing

2232
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,158
conditions

2233
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,640
that are um that suggest that you should

2234
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:42,158
not be taking psilocybin mushrooms as a

2235
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,600
micro dose is or is there anything that

2236
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:47,119
we already know

2237
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,840
that is is contraindicated

2238
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,238
yeah great question so

2239
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,480
microdosingpsychedelics.com

2240
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:53,759
is a great website that dr fadman put

2241
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,678
together that has all those

2242
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,039
contraindications and all the different

2243
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,600
medications

2244
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,079
um again that we're uh developing

2245
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,560
through

2246
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:04,079
the the you know more than 1500 reports

2247
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:07,840
that he's gotten

2248
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:07,840
over the years so um

2249
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:11,679
i just went blank chango what was the

2250
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:12,319
question again yeah we were talking

2251
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,039
about uh

2252
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:16,880
pre-existing uh contraindications

2253
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:19,679
contraindications right so

2254
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,440
as far as pre-existing contraindications

2255
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,880
we've gotten reports i should say dr

2256
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,359
fatiman's got reports that

2257
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,000
lithium is a medication that you should

2258
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:31,439
not combine with microdosing

2259
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,039
as well as a rare form of i believe it's

2260
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:35,359
yellow blue or

2261
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:37,119
some kind of colorblindness where people

2262
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,880
have reported for a few days after

2263
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:40,079
microdosing they're still seeing light

2264
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,840
tracers

2265
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:43,600
which is an effect that people get from

2266
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,960
taking large doses

2267
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,400
um what's fascinating is there

2268
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,679
aren't really any reported

2269
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:54,238
contraindications to dates with

2270
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:56,480
anti-antidepressants and you know

2271
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:58,000
many different pharmaceuticals so for me

2272
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,479
that's what is so

2273
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,560
exciting about the future is that these

2274
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:04,879
can be used as tools

2275
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,640
to help people wean off of other

2276
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,840
supplements now when i'm working with

2277
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,000
clients that are

2278
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,360
weaning off of drugs for many years this

2279
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,880
is also involving

2280
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:14,799
their doctor you know they go to their

2281
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,840
doctor first and they ask for a weaning

2282
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,520
protocol

2283
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,880
and what i'll tell you is majority of

2284
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,840
the doctors don't have a weaning

2285
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,440
protocol

2286
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,039
they know how to get you on a medication

2287
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,678
but they have no clue

2288
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:27,359
how to get you off so again you know you

2289
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,039
have to go to your doctor first and let

2290
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:31,279
them know you want to wean

2291
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,960
these medications you ask them for a

2292
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:34,238
protocol you ask them for a safe and

2293
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:37,359
effective way

2294
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:39,279
and you take it very very slowly so

2295
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:40,960
again you know weaning off of

2296
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:42,238
medications with microdosing is

2297
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,079
something that people should do

2298
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:46,000
with assistance with somebody who's

2299
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,519
guided other people from it

2300
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,520
of course you could do it on your own as

2301
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,400
well but again i'm excited

2302
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,840
for the future aspect of helping people

2303
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:54,799
get off of other drugs and other

2304
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,440
substances

2305
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,520
like alcohol tobacco heroin

2306
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:02,238
pharmaceuticals

2307
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,520
so you mentioned earlier you recommend

2308
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:05,839
in journaling and we recommend

2309
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,080
journaling a lot on this show both for

2310
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,279
finding out what cultivars of cannabis

2311
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,840
flowers you like

2312
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:17,279
or if you're doing a you know a high

2313
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:20,000
a high potency cannabis oil protocol for

2314
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,679
you know a for cancer or some other

2315
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,679
chronic disease

2316
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,359
journals are very important what do you

2317
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:28,399
recommend that

2318
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,679
your clients put in their microdosing

2319
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,399
journal and why do you tell them that

2320
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:34,000
they should have one

2321
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:35,599
well it's really subtle changes when

2322
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,640
you're working with microdosing and a

2323
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,800
lot of people

2324
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,360
come into microdosing and they want that

2325
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,840
home run grand slam on their first dose

2326
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:46,880
like they get from a large dose journey

2327
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,279
so for me the journaling

2328
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,319
is to help them notice the subtle things

2329
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:52,960
that are changing

2330
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:54,559
it's to help them look back at their day

2331
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,719
you know i more recommend

2332
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,840
in my practice that people journal

2333
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,439
before bed

2334
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,079
as a reflection on their day and how

2335
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,399
their day went and what i find is when i

2336
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,960
have

2337
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:06,639
follow-up conversations with them they

2338
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,760
start the conversation a lot of times

2339
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,320
with yeah it was

2340
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,440
a pretty good week um i didn't notice

2341
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:12,639
that much and i'm like all right well

2342
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:13,839
share with me your journal from

2343
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,280
wednesday

2344
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,880
and they read me their journal and then

2345
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:19,439
they're done and they're like oh wait

2346
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,079
actually there were huge huge

2347
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:22,158
improvements

2348
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:23,519
this week so the journaling more than

2349
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:24,319
anything is to connect them with

2350
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,080
themselves

2351
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:28,079
to connect them with where they want to

2352
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:30,158
focus and where their days went

2353
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:32,158
uh but it's also at the end of the month

2354
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:34,719
something that they can look back on and

2355
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:36,000
notice that they made giant leaps over

2356
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:39,359
the course of a month

2357
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,039
but they were simply in baby steps

2358
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,719
well adam i really appreciate you

2359
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:43,519
sharing all of your experience with us

2360
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,319
and you know

2361
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,400
your field is just like well i guess

2362
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:51,359
cannabis is your field too but you know

2363
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:52,479
the the both of these fields um suffer

2364
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:55,039
from a lot of bro

2365
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:55,759
science and one of the good things about

2366
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:58,640
this uh

2367
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,760
increasing normalization is that we're

2368
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,679
able to

2369
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,520
speak more freely with each other you

2370
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,119
know you we we've got this episode that

2371
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,679
people are going to be able to listen to

2372
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:07,599
and then

2373
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,679
talk to their friends and family and and

2374
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:13,039
this information is being able to be

2375
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:14,480
spread in ways that um well not only are

2376
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:17,359
more free but where we can

2377
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:18,000
really develop expertise and so i think

2378
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:20,399
it's a

2379
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,679
wonderful for you to join me on the show

2380
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:23,198
today so that we can

2381
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,960
you know discuss something within your

2382
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:27,039
expertise and hopefully get rid of some

2383
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:30,480
of the myths and replace them with

2384
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:32,238
with scientific encouragement

2385
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,158
most important thing we did years ago in

2386
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:35,839
canada's was re-educating people

2387
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:37,759
was teaching them the truth and myth

2388
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,360
busting and it's the same thing we have

2389
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,600
to do in psychedelics is

2390
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,679
re-educate and that's the path we're on

2391
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,760
