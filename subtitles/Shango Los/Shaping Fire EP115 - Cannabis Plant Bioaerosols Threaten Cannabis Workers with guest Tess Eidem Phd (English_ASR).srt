2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,599
cannabis is fabulous it cures and offers

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,080
relief to humans every single day it is

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,079
a sacred plant and you and I defend

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,240
cannabis with unwavering dedication and

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,439
heartfelt commitment and yet the truth

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,799
of the matter is is that cannabis can be

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,359
abused cannabis can make some people

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,719
sick and those cultivating cannabis can

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,800
get really sick by inhaling cannabis bio

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,640
aerosols we don't really want to admit

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,878
it because so many people condemn

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,878
cannabis falsely I don't want to give

14
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:42,079
them an inch and yet we really do need

15
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:43,878
to look at this new research because we

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,039
should push for better cannabis

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,799
workplace regulations to keep our

18
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,079
friends safe who spend their days

19
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,959

transitioned into the Cannabis industry

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,519
where she spent four years working

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,920
directly in cannabis production and

64
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,879
quality management this unique

65
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,479
experience allowed her to combin her

preventative controls qualified

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,680
individual to help cannabis cultivators

70
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,359
minimize potential hazards within their

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,920
facilities and in their

72
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,959
products having witnessed firsthand the

73
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,399
challenges of microbial contamination in

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,400
the Cannabis industry Dr Edom returned

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,200
to the University of Colorado Boulder

76
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,599
where she currently works as a senior

77
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,959
research scientist in the aerobiology

78
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,439
and disinfection laboratory with a focus

79
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,640
on practical building science her

80
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,759
research investigates bio aosl

81
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,158
persistence associated with cannabis

82
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,878
environments including Airborne molds

83
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:12,039
allergens and pathogens she's driven to

84
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:14,158
connect unbias scientific research with

85
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,199
environmental engineering principles and

86
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,479
applying them to the Cannabis space to

87
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,399
improve worker well-being plant health

88
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,439
and consumer safety during the short

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,280
first set we will discuss the nature of

90
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,120
Bio aerosols in the longer second set we

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,318
will discuss the threat Matrix of

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,519
cannabis bio aerosols we will look at

93
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,919
the various sources of fungal bacterial

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,158
and viral bio aerosols and determine

95
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,559
their threat levels to cannabis workers

96
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,359
and we will finish the episode

97
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,479
considering actions that cannabis folk

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,080
can use to keep themselves safe and

99
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,238
mitigation actions employers and

100
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,120
Regulators can Implement to decrease bio

101
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,079
aosl risk welcome to shaping fire

102
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,840
Tess good to be here so let's get right

103
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,480
into it what's the difference between

104
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,400
simply smelling cannabis and enjoying

105
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,199
those aromatics like we all do versus

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,280
inhaling bio aerosols that can be

107
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,119
harmful when in

108
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,799
volume that's a really good question um

109
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,560
you know and the the aroma that comes

110
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,600
off of the Cannabis flower when you're

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,120
breathing that in it's a lot of the uh

112
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,720
Vapors so a lot of the gases that come

113
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,959
off of the flower itself so that's your

114
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,680
volatile organic compounds your voc's

115
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,038
that'll mostly be tpin and Esters and uh

116
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,160
give th those kind of of classic Aroma

117
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:38,759
you know gassy diesel uh um you know

118
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,039
fruity types of Aromas um while when

119
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,240
you're breathing in BIO aerosols it's

120
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:46,439
not just the gases that are present um

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,680
but there's actually small particles

122
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,519
floating around in the air that um may

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,720
contain biological materials at least in

124
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,758
part so that could be coming from

125
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,759
microorganisms uh in the environment it

126
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,919
can be coming coming from the plant

127
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,919
matter itself it can be from the

128
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,399
substrates it can be from humans um so

129
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,279
there's a lot of different things that

130
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,279
can be floating around in the Cannabis

131
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,399
environment that are actually bio

132
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:18,839
aerosols in addition to those Vapors uh

133
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:21,120
that give Aromas right on so would would

134
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,119
those Vapors that give the Aromas would

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,439
those also be a subset of Bio aerosols

136
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,280
they're just not the bio aerosols that

137
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,279
we're concerned about or are they not

138
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:32,478
actually considered bio aerosol

139
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,839
because they don't have Airborne

140
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,240
particulate matter that is a great

141
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:41,000
question too so the definition of an

142
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,120
aerosol is it's it's got to have that uh

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,160
that physical Mass it's in a in a solid

144
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,038
form so it's not in gaseous phase so

145
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,199
those aerosols are the particulate

146
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:56,519
matter while um voc's are going to be in

147
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,038
gas phase so it's kind of like um for

148
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:01,279
example a difference would be uh when

149
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,240
it's really hum hum out that's water in

150
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,079
its Vapor phase that's your relative

151
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,240
humidity but if I were to spray you with

152
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,439
a a spritzer they that little uh

153
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,360
spritzer is generating tiny little

154
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,800
aerosols of water so like tiny little uh

155
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,280
droplets of water essentially so that's

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,800
the difference between a an aerosol and

157
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,159
a vapor right on that that makes sense

158
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,520
to me and it makes sense why it would uh

159
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,039
potentially injure the human body a lot

160
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:33,680
more because the gas will you know we

161
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:37,519
was more easily um uh gotten rid of by

162
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,160
our human system than little chunks of

163
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,959
stuff to use the scientific terms chunks

164
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,560
of stuff chunks of stuff I like it we're

165
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:48,560
going to cosos the chunks of stuff um we

166
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,240
love to make acronyms in in science yeah

167
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,319
I mean voccs can be potentially harmful

168
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,598
especially at high levels um but it has

169
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,199
to be pretty high and different V you

170
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:01,918
know voc's is like grouping in tons of

171
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,960
different organic compound so some may

172
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,839
be at higher levels uh tend to be more

173
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,478
irritant um or if it comes in contact

174
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,239
with your skin um you know some people

175
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,758
don't if you get uh contact with like

176
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,360
essential oils most essential oils are

177
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,560
actually tpin and sometimes that can

178
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,439
irritate people's skin or it can be

179
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,720
soothing to some people so it really

180
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:28,079
just depends on a person's sensitization

181
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,680
to those different compounds and the

182
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,959
specific compounds that are part of

183
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,439
those voc's right on understood so

184
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,159
during the introduction to the show um

185
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,199
you know I pointed out for folks that

186
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,160
you are really on The Cutting Edge of

187
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:46,319
this science and that the research here

188
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,400
is is just starting and so of course I'm

189
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,319
going to be asking you to theorize some

190
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,279
as as the expert to help give us context

191
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,879
but but what I want to ask about is you

192
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,839
know how are these harms theoretical

193
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,840
because as people who work in the

194
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,279
Cannabis industry I mean I know that

195
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,198
when I work with the plants um when a

196
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,598
lot of them touch my skin over the

197
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,158
course of a day I'll get uh you know a

198
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:14,839
rash or hives so so I know my human does

199
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:16,680
have a reaction to the plant sometimes

200
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,119
in ways that are less Pleasant because

201
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,439
those hives are a real drag um but but

202
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,639
you know I've got lots of friends who

203
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,038
work in the

204
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,560
industry but who don't complain about

205
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,680
the kinds of issues that are in the

206
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,720
study are are these harms more

207
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,399
theoretical that they could happen or

208
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,519
are we already seeing them in people who

209
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,918
work in

210
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,759
cannabis yeah we are seeing it um in you

211
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:45,240
know the limited reports that are out

212
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,559
there um people do have that contact uh

213
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,240
dermatitis or you know they develop

214
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,879
hives um from touching plants that's why

215
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,639
you'll usually see people wear like

216
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:58,078
sleeves during Harvest to protect their

217
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:00,439
arms um from that contact and that could

218
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:02,399
be the result of a lot of different

219
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,839
things it could be irritants from the

220
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,759
plant it could be developing allergies

221
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,040
which is a little less

222
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:12,639
understood um and uh then there's the

223
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,759
respiratory exposures which can also be

224
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,078
harmful and you know even though there's

225
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,919
not a lot of data out there in the

226
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:22,120
Cannabis space we know based on you know

227
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,159
parallels in other Industries other

228
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,399
agricultural settings that these

229
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:31,199
agricultural dusts um and those

230
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:34,679
environments can generate um potentially

231
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,600
harmful uh aerosols or bio aerosols that

232
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,639
uh especially over the course of time

233
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,320
and repeated exposures some people tend

234
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,838
to you know genetics plays a role in

235
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,720
this too so some folks may be more

236
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,160
sensitized to some of these agents in

237
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,920
the air uh for all sorts of reasons um

238
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,278
and so one of the reasons why I think

239
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:57,078
it's not as investigated in the Cannabis

240
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,679
space is because the Cannabis industry

241
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:03,479
is really relatively pretty new um you

242
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:05,479
know here in my home state of Colorado

243
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,680
it's been recreationally legal since

244
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,720
2014 so you know we have like 10 maybe

245
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:14,639
20 years of data we're of like looking

246
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,920
at some of uh these bio aerosols but

247
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,759
most of the recent reports have been

248
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:22,278
within the last couple years and it has

249
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:25,519
to do with um you know employees having

250
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,958
Adverse Events at work uh to Something

251
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,720
in the Air uh in these

252
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:34,559
facilities I'm sure that to there is a

253
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,480
not insignificant number of people who

254
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:41,638
are not reporting as well and and you

255
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,680
know how can the how can the science

256
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,200
capture the incidences if the employee

257
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:48,239
doesn't report it or if the employer

258
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,278
doesn't report it or if there's nowhere

259
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,240
to report it to so in in your research

260
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:57,679
what are some of the main reasons you

261
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,759
have found that that Under reporting

262
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,638
happens

263
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,519
yeah I think that's a really good

264
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,560
question and it's it's you know my

265
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,679
answer will be pretty speculative but

266
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,799
from my

267
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,958
experience um you know a lot of these

268
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,838
cannabis companies because uh you know

269
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,278
cultivating and Manufacturing cannabis

270
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:21,480
is still federally illegal there's kind

271
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:24,720
of this Con concept that um you know

272
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,600
Federal oversight on employee health

273
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,959
standards and employee safety don't

274
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,399
apply to uh these cannabis companies

275
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:35,679
which is just untrue like OSHA um OSHA

276
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,519
regulations or the occupational safety

277
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,519
and health administration their

278
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,839
standards and their regulations still

279
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,759
apply in these cannabis operations um

280
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,079
and then you know there's just in

281
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,600
general there's a kind of a stigma

282
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:51,599
surrounding cannabis in general you know

283
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,360
from reporting it to your doctor that

284
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,839
you use it to reporting incidents at

285
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,759
work um especially some of you know

286
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,839
unlike getting run over by a fork or

287
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,679
something like that or you know some of

288
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,240
these maybe repeated motions um that

289
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,519
that are pretty typical of a lot of

290
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,639
other manufacturing and cultivation

291
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,799
environments um having Adverse Events

292
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,039
like respiratory distress is not as well

293
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:21,599
understood and um not everyone

294
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,559
experiences it exactly the same so

295
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,440
because you know some people may

296
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,439
experience it other people in that exact

297
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,880
same environment may not experience like

298
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,320
shortness of breath or wheezing

299
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:35,120
or other um respiratory issues uh they

300
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,000
may feel like it might be in their head

301
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,759
or something's wrong with them or

302
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,559
they're they just don't want to be

303
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,919
associated with cannabis in in general

304
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:46,439
at least officially and so they may not

305
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:50,559
report it to their internal safety

306
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,600
manager if if they have one um or to

307
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,000
like you know their state OSHA or nios

308
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,839
um

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,240
Representatives so in the second set

310
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,000
we're going to talk more about the

311
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,159
specific threats but generally speaking

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,600
um are these bio aerosols and the impact

313
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,639
on on the humans who work there is this

314
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,959
something that really only impacts those

315
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,839
working in manufacturing commercial

316
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,518
quantities of cannabis or or might these

317
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,800
fungal spores and bacteria and plant

318
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,519
materials be at a high enough density in

319
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:29,759
a cannabis patient's home greenhouse or

320
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:32,320
in their basement say of like 20 or like

321
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,919
let's say 15 to 25 plants which might be

322
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,278
typical of of a patient regardless of

323
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,120
what the law says that you know that's

324
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:43,919
fairly typical you know could these bio

325
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,198
aerosols exist at that low of a density

326
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,559
or does it really have to be scaled

327
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:50,159
commercial

328
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,518
growing you know I think that this

329
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:56,360
scaling you know just like anything else

330
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,560
scaling uh also your problem scale so I

331
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,240
would say that it's probably more likely

332
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,399
that the

333
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,519
um you know the diversity and the amount

334
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,360
of Bio aerosols in some of these indoor

335
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,360
commercial operations especially those

336
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,800
that are retrofitted buildings or maybe

337
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,959
have improper HVAC design um and

338
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,319
implementation you probably are going to

339
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,958
see much higher levels of Bio aerosols

340
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,278
in those environments just because of

341
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:27,359
the sheer number of plants and they're

342
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:31,519
all you know transpiring and putting in

343
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,000
moisture in the air and um the materials

344
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,679
in those spaces may not be suitable for

345
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,720
the high humidity um warm temperature

346
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,519
conditions and so you probably are

347
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,320
seeing it more in those in those

348
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,120
environments especially um in

349
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,720
cultivation and then maybe slightly

350
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,879
different bio aerosols on the processing

351
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,759
side of things and you know when you're

352
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:55,480
grinding you know 50 lbs of flour a day

353
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,320
um you probably are going to be exposed

354
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,800
to a lot more of these bio aerosols than

355
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,600
uh when you're just grinding up you know

356
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,519
a pound that you

357
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,278
harvested um you know a couple weeks ago

358
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,078
and you're now uh trimming or grinding

359
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,480
at home so it really does depend and it

360
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,039
depends on your unique home environment

361
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,440
as well um really controlling the

362
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,599
temperature and humidity and then uh if

363
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,120
you do notice that you have respiratory

364
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,560
distress when you're handling plant

365
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,198
matter especially dried plant matter um

366
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,758
then I would just say home to uh wear

367
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,958
like a a respirator like an n95 you know

368
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,560
we're all pretty familiar with these

369
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,799
things since Co but that will help to

370
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,838
prevent being exposed to some of those

371
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,719
potential

372
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,560
particulates and for goodness sakes if

373
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,920
you're doing this at home well also at

374
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,719
work um use a use a HEPA filter for

375
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,759
goodness sakes um uh you know we've got

376
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,440
a uh we've got a a patient organization

377
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,759
here on vashan island where I live and

378
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,480
at least until covid prior to covid we

379
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:03,879
would all get together every fall

380
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,879
and um and trim together and uh and when

381
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,240
you've got that many people with that

382
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,919
many plants from different places you

383
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,000
know people were people would find

384
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,120
themselves sneezing they like I don't

385
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,559
sneeze around my own plants you know but

386
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,198
but everybody's growing in different

387
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,439
ways and so just those just those very

388
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,159
basic things like like masking and

389
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,759
gloves and a HEPA filter um for anybody

390
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,958
who well not only do do you want to use

391
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,120
it for people who are sensitive but it's

392
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,919
it's really good to use that stuff even

393
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,198
if you're not sensitive yet because so

394
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,599
many people get become sensitive from

395
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,719
repeat usage right so so if somebody's

396
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,680
listening to the show and they're

397
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
feeling cocky they're like oh there's

398
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,919
none of this at my work environment it's

399
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,839
like well you might not just be

400
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,278
sensitive yet right right yes you can

401
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,000
definitely develop allergies just like

402
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,799
with anything else in your life you know

403
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,480
you may not have allergies to gluten

404
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:58,078
when you're young but as you get older

405
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,720
you might develop them um and that's

406
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,638
that's true for cannabis as well you can

407
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,160
develop allergies against cannabis

408
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,880
there's also potentially different molds

409
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,319
that could be on the product or in the

410
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,480
environment that could exacerbate that

411
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:14,519
or you could potentially be allergic to

412
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,679
those as well so it's um it's not very

413
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:21,318
well understood but there is evidence

414
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,400
that um that you can become sensitized

415
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:27,159
to specific uh protein allergens from

416
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,960
the cannabis plant itself I want to hit

417
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,160
on um an answer you gave a little

418
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,000
earlier about the the web of Regulation

419
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,880
um you know I can imagine that the web

420
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,279
of Regulation regarding you know

421
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,799
cannabis bio Eros Sals is a total mess

422
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:41,798
since cannabis is still legal at the

423
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:45,079
federal level you've got some of the

424
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:47,519
federal agencies that are not regulating

425
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:49,639
it because it's not legal but then

426
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,359
you've got other federal agencies like

427
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,840
OSHA that that are still encouraging you

428
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,158
know employee protection at these

429
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,599
companies but then you've got the states

430
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,600
who have got who who are trying to

431
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,158
normalize like I'm sure that most of

432
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,480
them are trying to regulate it at some

433
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:08,000
level creating this

434
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,798
Patchwork is anything effective about

435
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,440
this Patchwork are we moving in the

436
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,279
right direction or is it just going to

437
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,960
be a mess until Federal

438
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,599
legalization well I do think that the

439
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,840
legal status of cannabis definitely

440
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,199
makes it more challenging to provide

441
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,119
Baseline data and just the basic

442
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,240
research to understand what's floating

443
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,079
around in these diverse indoor

444
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,880
environments and maybe even mixed

445
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:35,038
environments like green houses um you

446
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,320
know the process of cannabis cultivation

447
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,119
and proc you know dry curing is pretty

448
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,158
uniform every grow I go to I mean

449
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,759
there's slight variance on how each

450
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,120
grower does it but the process is pretty

451
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,079
similar but the environments in which

452
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,519
those are grown in are usually very

453
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,359
different from I've been to Old tuna

454
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,359
factories that are now cannabis grows

455
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:01,558
I've been to um like state-of-the-art

456
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:05,678
like built in Japan um and then shipped

457
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:07,918
over uh green houses um I've been into

458
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,679
all these different types of settings

459
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,159
for cannabis cultivation so it's all

460
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,720
very diverse and so that can also change

461
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,559
the bio aerosols that are in those

462
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,400
environments and just in general uh bio

463
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:22,240
aerosols in indoor environments you know

464
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,240
from uh you know University indoor

465
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,279
settings like I'm at right now to home

466
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,159
setting home settings to other

467
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,839
manufacturing settings uh there's not

468
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,720
that much that's like really understood

469
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,798
and there's definitely not standards

470
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,519
that are uh set by some of these um

471
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,879
especially occupational safety um

472
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,839
standards so there are uh there are

473
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,360
definitely standards set for different

474
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:52,319
pollutants you know different gases for

475
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:56,199
Malahide in the air um ozone in the air

476
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:59,519
um but for for aerosols and bio aerosols

477
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,519
it's not uh the correlation between

478
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:06,038
exposure and disease is much more

479
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:08,359
challenging to establish and so a lot of

480
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:11,599
these organizations just don't have

481
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:13,519
standards that or regulations on the

482
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,678
amount of Bio aerosols that can be found

483
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,759
in an indoor environment any indoor

484
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,600
environment um and unfortunately that

485
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,359
that is compounding the challenges that

486
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,558
we have in the Cannabis space is that we

487
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:30,119
just don't have many standards to

488
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:32,918
protect people from high bio aoso loads

489
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,759
in these built environments which all

490
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,600
just makes the case for science like

491
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,679
you're doing

492
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:41,879
right yes more data always more data

493
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,519
more data so people so people can take

494
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,159
more action yeah that makes a lot of

495
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,480
sense well okay so so let's wrap up this

496
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,799
first set um during the second set which

497
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,319
will be our by far our biggest set today

498
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,279

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,600
any good research on this yet and so the

667
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,278
this this preliminary and and like you

668
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,959
know not not preliminary but but this

669
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:40,599
original research that we're talking

670
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,360
about today is shining a light on

671
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:45,079
something that needs to be looked at

672
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,918
much more closely longterm for our

673
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:49,798
friends who work in cannabis so Tess you

674
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,640
know during the first set we talked

675
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:54,079
about bio aerosols that are created

676
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,320
during cannabis cultivation and and we

677
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:59,720
gave a definition but what are these bio

678
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:01,119
aerosols that we're that we want to be

679
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,679
so aware

680
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:08,038
of yeah so you with Co I think more

681
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,559
folks are a little bit more uh educated

682
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:10,679
on this just with a baseline

683
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:12,759
understanding and a lot of times when we

684
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,600
think of Bio aerosols we think of these

685
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:19,839
intact microorganisms so we've got

686
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:22,199
intact viruses or intact bacteria or

687
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,839
intact like mold spores that are

688
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,440
floating around either um you know from

689
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,038
from the from like a moldy part of the

690
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,519
environment that you're in and they're

691
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:36,519
releasing those spores or it could be

692
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,480
generated when let's say you're watering

693
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,720
or there's aerosolization of water that

694
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,399
contains some of these microorganisms or

695
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,240
you know in disease transmission we talk

696
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,719
about a lot the aerosols that are

697
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,798
created when we're talking to each other

698
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,360
breathing normally um and so all of that

699
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:54,119
can generate bio aerosols in an

700
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,359
environment and in the Cannabis space

701
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,599
it's uh there has been some research

702
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,240
that's been done to kind of try to get

703
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,798
an understanding of what's actually

704
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,960
floating around in the air when it comes

705
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:08,119
to these biological organisms and from

706
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,120
an industrial hygiene perspective a lot

707
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:13,119
of times what uh what people will do is

708
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,798
they'll go into facilities and they'll

709
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,678
sample you know they'll take a certain

710
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,398
volume of air and they'll do a lot of

711
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,480
counting so they'll count the number of

712
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,798
mold spores and try to bend them into

713
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,480
different groups of molds um or they'll

714
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:30,960
they'll take that air sample and they'll

715
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,798
culture it on pet tree dishes and be

716
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,200
able to get a number of viable

717
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:39,240
microorganisms or Colony forming unit

718
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,759
cfu which might sound familiar to those

719
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,278
folks who know anything about Cannabis

720
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:45,278
Testing cfu is also used to enumerate

721
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,359
viable microbes on the Cannabis flower

722
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:50,839
itself but the cfu of microorganisms can

723
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,839
be in the air as well and so you think

724
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:55,359
about those intact microorganisms those

725
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:58,959
viable microorganisms and then there's

726
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,759
also uh their breakdown products um so

727
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,240
they're metabolites they can secrete

728
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,480
into the environment different

729
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,880
metabolites they can break down over

730
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,640
time and so these micro bits and pieces

731
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,039
can end up being in the air especially

732
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,720
if it's part of these agricultural dusts

733
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:16,079
that may settle but then become more

734
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,079
airborn during you know normal work

735
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,439
environment conditions and and

736
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,398
activities in that

737
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,159
environment and those microbial

738
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:28,038
metabolites can include uh different

739
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,399
types of toxins they can include um just

740
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:33,119
immune activators your immune system

741
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:36,038
over billions of years has uh really

742
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,518
developed uh an a way to identify

743
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:40,000
something that's foreign especially if

744
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,919
it's bacterial or fungal it's like

745
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,240
that's not me and I'm going to mount a

746
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,080
response at that and then there's these

747
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,000
other uh uh different types of protein

748
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:53,839
components that typically are what we

749
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,720
call allergens and those activate a

750
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,000
different branch of our of the immune

751
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,000
system and that's where we get you know

752
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,638
the stereotypical allergies from you

753
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,839
know when there's a lot of pollen in the

754
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:07,038
air um or if you're allergic to cats or

755
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:08,398
dogs and you go into somebody's house

756
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,798
and they have cats you're going to be

757
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:14,038
breathing in sort of uh you know the

758
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:15,960
protein allergens from those cats and

759
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,398
dogs and those can also be present not

760
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,840
necessarily cats and dogs well I have

761
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:23,079
seen a dog in a grow before um yeah that

762
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:26,079
I've definitely seen that yeah

763
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:28,519
yeah but you know from any molds that

764
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,119
are in that environment um they can

765
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,480
definitely produce lots of different

766
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,918
types of allergens and the cannabis

767
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,120
plant itself can also produce different

768
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,440
allergens so those are kind of the you

769
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:43,439
know it spreads the entire um uh

770
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,720
Spectrum from these intact organisms

771
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,919
some of which may be harmful and

772
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,798
pathogenic and then all the way down to

773
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,038
breakdown products or bits in pieces or

774
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,200
metabolites that can also be harmful in

775
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:58,480
different

776
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,519
ways so um I want to uh shine our light

777
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,639
for a moment on on the measurement

778
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,599
standard cfu because you know when you

779
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:09,000
were uh originally answering the

780
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:12,359
question you were talking about uh

781
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,119
intact um uh fungal spores and such and

782
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,519
I was thinking about intact what does

783
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:20,759
she mean about intact and I'm like oh it

784
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:22,000
it probably relates to cfu which which I

785
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,638
didn't really

786
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,278
mean I didn't really grock it very well

787
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:29,519
until I read your paper because I think

788
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,038
there was something the the new fear

789
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,000
about it because when I'm talking when

790
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:36,440
I'm when I'm talking with folks about

791
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,038
Cannabis Testing and they talk about cfu

792
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,320
it doesn't it doesn't really seem like a

793
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,679
threat but when I read your paper and I

794
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:46,879
read about cfu and for those of you who

795
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:49,278
don't know it's Colony forming units now

796
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,120
it's totally sounds like Alien

797
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:55,079
Invasion and I'm all like wow like in in

798
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:59,239
the cultivation space there are these

799
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:02,519
you know these these this fungal spores

800
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,079
and different biology that are floating

801
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,798
around and they are alive and they could

802
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:11,678
form colonies and I'm breathing them in

803
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:13,918
and that seems super creepy to me and um

804
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,360
I I think that it really kind of shines

805
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,759
a light on our conversation in a

806
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:20,558
different way which which I think that

807
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,480
could people could make this

808
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,200
conversation kind of like

809
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,120
intellectualized and get really into

810
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,639
just the data and not realize that

811
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:35,798
really we're talking about like like

812
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:38,839
one variety of living biology coming in

813
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:42,558
contact with another variety of living

814
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:45,158
biology being us and and and like how

815
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,678
are these two biologies going to

816
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,080
interact are they you know is our immune

817
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,159
system just going to squash them or are

818
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,720
they going to like ruin our whole weak

819
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,760
or or longer by by you know forming

820
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,240
these colonies right that we that we

821
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:04,798
referred to in the standard um and so I

822
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,839
I just add that to to to make

823
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:11,119
these

824
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:13,239
microbiology sized um living organisms

825
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,760
seem more real because as soon as you

826
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:17,279
start talking about

827
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,159
cfu it really gives them a lot more of

828
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,399
aggressive

829
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,159
personality yeah because they're alive

830
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:25,960
you know because when you look at um a

831
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,398
comparison so if you if I were to take a

832
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,800
set volume of air and

833
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,719
look at that air that I collected either

834
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,519
on a filter or there's lots of different

835
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:38,759
ways to collect uh bio biological

836
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:41,039
particulate from the air that will you

837
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,200
know preserve it sometimes that

838
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,398
impaction can kill microbes so you got

839
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,759
to your collection method is really

840
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:49,838
important when you're trying to evaluate

841
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,520
certain especially viable microorganisms

842
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:54,838
in the air um

843
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,358
and and when you're pulling that out of

844
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:57,960
the air if I were to look at mold spores

845
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:59,440
for example I could count the number of

846
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,559
mold spores but not all those mold

847
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,079
spores are actually going to turn into a

848
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,759
viable Colony forming unit kind of like

849
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,720
how when you're growing plants not all

850
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,960
your seeds germinate so uh it's really

851
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:14,480
actually a pretty low amount it's about

852
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,760
1% uh of mold spores will actually like

853
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,159
sporulate into a viable Colony forming

854
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,000
unit um and so you get a slightly

855
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:25,039
different answer but those mold spores

856
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,760
could still potentially be harmful even

857
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,519
though they're not alive because of

858
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,160
these other microbial metabolites that

859
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,400
could be on those spores or associated

860
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:35,480
with them like allergens and then even

861
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,160
if they are alive they may not really be

862
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,639
harmful to most people um if they're not

863
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:43,358
pathogens meaning they don't really

864
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,239
really cause disease they don't have the

865
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:49,799
capability to to Really infect a human

866
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:51,318
um they may not they may be a pathogen

867
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,680
but maybe they're not very good at being

868
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:55,318
transmitted through the route of

869
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:58,440
inhalation so some microorganisms are

870
00:35:55,318 --> 00:36:00,358
are better at uh you know being breathed

871
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,960
in and and being transferred from one

872
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,119
person to another like many viruses are

873
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,318
are transferred that way you know

874
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,838
Legionnaire's Disease uh that's

875
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:11,960
bacterium that uh can be transferred in

876
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:16,119
the air and and spread disease uh

877
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,280
usually from water um and then there's

878
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,559
there so some some microorganisms just

879
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,200
aren't really good at at being uh

880
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,719
transmitted by disease through the air

881
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,279
but those that are could potentially be

882
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:30,358
harmful especially to a sub upset of

883
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,599
people who may have a compromised immune

884
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,440
system you know you do have an immune

885
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,400
system a resident immune system in your

886
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,559
lung um I'm not an immunologist but my

887
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,559
co-author Tara nordgren um who who

888
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,679
helped me with the paper she is she

889
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,838
actually studies lung Immunology

890
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:50,679
especially in response to agricultural

891
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:52,719
dust and so these these viable pathogens

892
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:55,000
could potentially be harmful to those

893
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,318
folks who are immune compromised and

894
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that's where you may see like um you

895
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:01,880
know in particular as aspergillis

896
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,318
fumigatus uh it's a World Health

897
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,838
Organization critical priority fungal

898
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:09,800
pathogen um it could potentially uh if

899
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,239
it's in the air which it's very common

900
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,280
in the air in many different

901
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:16,279
environments um if you are a

902
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,680
particularly sensitive person or have a

903
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,200
compromised immune system there could be

904
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:23,480
a chance that exposure could uh result

905
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,960
in some type of aspergilus related

906
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,639
disease which can come in a variety of

907
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,519
different flavors from um aspergillosis

908
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,078
which is that active fungal infection of

909
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:35,920
the lung to um different hypers

910
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:39,240
sensitivities to aspergilus and again

911
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,358
that has to do with exposure to those

912
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,598
allergens when we get to that part of

913
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,000
the study where it lists all of the

914
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,440
Latin names of all of the things that

915
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,239
could go wrong with you it it does seem

916
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,519
like a threat you know I'm I'm like are

917
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,799
you threatening me you know it's like

918
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:56,000
these are none of these things are

919
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,079
things that I want to get from my plants

920
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,239
and I think that for most people when

921
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,560
they're when they when they're when they

922
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,439
they say oh there's there can be things

923
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:06,519
in the air at in the grow most people

924
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,079
are just assuming that these are things

925
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:12,639
that are drifting off of the plant right

926
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,200
but it it was really remarkable to me to

927
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:20,078
read all of the different sources that

928
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:21,879
you identify in the paper uh 1 2 3 4 5 6

929
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,039
7 like like there's at least eight or

930
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,960
nine of them um we don't have to go

931
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:27,519
through them all but would you review

932
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,599
you know a handful of them for us

933
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,079
because what I'm hoping to get out of

934
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,400
this question is people to have a a

935
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,839
better understanding of all the

936
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,440
different places that bio aerosols that

937
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,440
could threaten them

938
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,200
start yeah absolutely so in that paper

939
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,519
there's a a figure that just kind of

940
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,559
shows the the general process of

941
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,239
cultivation dry cure and the

942
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:52,759
manufacturing processing side and and at

943
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,719
each point in the process there's likely

944
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,400
different bio aerosols being generated

945
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,199
from different sources and that can

946
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,639
include the substrate that you're

947
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,598
working with like cocoa core or even

948
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:05,759
rock wool could potentially generate

949
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:09,559
different bio aerosols um the the

950
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,880
fertigation irrigation system the HVAC

951
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:15,400
system even moldy walls or you know

952
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,000
standing water could potentially uh

953
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,200
result in some of these bio aerosols if

954
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,679
you're using beneficial microorganisms

955
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:26,439
or any even beneficial uh like predatory

956
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:28,679
uh mites or other insects um you know

957
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,599
insect allergies are pretty common and

958
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:33,318
people who work there's actually been

959
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,960
documentation of developing allergies

960
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:37,639
towards some of these um insects and

961
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,358
arachnids that are used in these

962
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:43,519
cultivation facilities um and then along

963
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,719
the entire process you know when you

964
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:49,800
transition over from cultivation into uh

965
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:52,118
dry cure and and really particularly in

966
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,240
manufacturing much of the bio aerosol

967
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,119
that's going to be generated are likely

968
00:39:54,239 --> 00:40:00,838
going to be from the plant matter itself

969
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:04,760
so so especially in those um handling

970
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:06,719
and trimming and grinding of dried plant

971
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,119
material that's when you start seeing

972
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:12,598
more and more uh of the bio aerosols

973
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:17,440
being composed of that plant

974
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:20,359
matter so shaping fire we tend to lean

975
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,358
towards regenerative growing topics

976
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:26,679
we're not we're not very uh into salt

977
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:29,159
growing in A+ B here um and in even

978
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:31,519
outdoor and Sunshine so we tend towards

979
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:34,358
that direction here and what I'm hearing

980
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,480
from you is that certainly while some of

981
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:38,799
the the chemical contaminants or

982
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,400
chemical issues that that we might

983
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,680
inhale might go away most of everything

984
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,160
you're talking about is biology and

985
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:50,239
sounds like it would be just as a just

986
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:53,759
as applicable to a regeneratively minded

987
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,318
grow as it would a full-on chemical

988
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,839
hydroponic

989
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:00,639
grow yeah sure I mean these uh

990
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:03,400
biological components are going to be

991
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,679
present in lots of different uh you know

992
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,000
ways of growing and cultivating Canabis

993
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:10,879
and and I'm definitely a believer of

994
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,559
regenerative uh farming and agriculture

995
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,000
as well as you know I love microbes I I

996
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:17,799
think that they definitely can help in

997
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,159
the grow beneficials but it's it's about

998
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,560
kind of uh understanding what is in the

999
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,279
air and monitoring that and controlling

1000
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,920
that so that uh you know you're really

1001
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,319
minimizing exposure because it's about

1002
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,280
exposure and the frequency exposure the

1003
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,960
amount that you're exposed and your

1004
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,880
genetic predisposition that's going to

1005
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,559
ultimately result in whether or not you

1006
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,358
uh have a negative Health outcome

1007
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,519
because of some of these exposures and

1008
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:48,480
many people who work in agriculture over

1009
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,318
time especially um you know in Nebraska

1010
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,119
where I'm from originally and where a

1011
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,000
lot of This research is is being done at

1012
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:56,400
my alma moer University of Nebraska

1013
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,760
Medical Center uh people who work in

1014
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,280
these agricultural

1015
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Industries um tend not to want to wear

1016
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,800
masks you know they uh they don't that

1017
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,599
that kind of last engineering control

1018
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,800
that you can put in place that that mask

1019
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:14,760
over your face to protect you um is not

1020
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,480
you know the kind of uh culture there is

1021
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,839
I'm not going to wear a mask and that's

1022
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,280
that's fine except for you're being

1023
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:20,838
exposed to some of these dusts you're

1024
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,040
being exposed to some of these other

1025
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,799
elements that could be in the air and I

1026
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,239
think that that can translate over into

1027
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,640
cannabis as well as you may be exposed

1028
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:32,519
Ed um but you don't know um you know

1029
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,239
what's really in the air and so I think

1030
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,719
doing some basic monitoring uh can be

1031
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,959
really helpful so that you can kind of

1032
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:42,519
gauge well do I really have anything to

1033
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,519
worry about or are our levels pretty you

1034
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:48,318
know relatively low from the few kind of

1035
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:51,920
standards that are out there um or is it

1036
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:54,199
more in line with like uh a post

1037
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,480
hurricane building that's had flood

1038
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:59,759
damage and I'm like I've got mold boore

1039
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,400
levels like in line with some of these

1040
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,599
remediated sites so kind of trying to

1041
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,079
gauge that for yourself really requires

1042
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,760
you to to take a look at what's floating

1043
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:11,920
around I know this is kind of a a

1044
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,200
sidebar but um this whole idea of

1045
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,159
wearing masks while doing agriculture is

1046
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:20,358
still relatively new to me but it was

1047
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:23,799
really run home for me about it's been

1048
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:27,078
about a month ago now um I was down in

1049
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,318
Oxnard doing some bio remediation cons

1050
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,039
Consulting for um soil biologist

1051
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:33,279
Leighton Morrison who's been on the show

1052
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,440
a couple times and I was down there we

1053
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,880
were we were working with this fancy new

1054
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,599
compost uh recipe and um while I was

1055
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,559
staying at his house my asthma just was

1056
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,680
like terrible and and and and because I

1057
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,640
was being a smart alec I I was blaming

1058
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:52,078
the local flower that I picked up at a

1059
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:54,440
dispensary in Oxnard and he's like man

1060
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,079
you're missing the bigger point we're in

1061
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:00,280
the heart of old school petroleum

1062
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,680
agriculture here and I'm like oh I

1063
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,440
didn't think about it and and we jumped

1064
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,719
on the C and we drove around and he just

1065
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,838
showed me you know you know thousands

1066
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:15,759
and thousands of Acres that were all um

1067
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,759
over tilled and and nutrition and

1068
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:31,000
course and and he described all the

1069
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,599
weird things that happens in his yard

1070
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,559
because of all the things that they

1071
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:36,960
spray just a couple blocks away and I

1072
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,079
started thinking to myself well when I

1073
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,639
when I visit him I should probably wear

1074
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:44,720
a mask this really isn't good for for my

1075
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:47,719
asthma but then I then we go for a a

1076
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:50,199
drive and I see all of these workers who

1077
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:52,000
are there working in the fields right

1078
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:54,399
there with all this dust blowing around

1079
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,480
and it's it's filled with traditional

1080
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,280
petroleum you know pesticides and

1081
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,920
chemicals and it really drove the idea

1082
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,640
home of why people in agriculture should

1083
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,159
be wearing masks it's man it's it makes

1084
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:09,159
me think of like all like the other

1085
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:11,920
traditional Industries where you trade

1086
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:15,519
your body for work like like coal mining

1087
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,800
right yeah yeah and yeah and that that

1088
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,440
was you know in coal mining um and black

1089
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,720
lung and things like that that's not

1090
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:27,159
necessarily exposure to bio aerosols but

1091
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:30,838
these tiny particles that basically uh

1092
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:33,039
um can can can physically cause damage

1093
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,920
to your lung and that mounts an immune

1094
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:39,079
response which then can restructure your

1095
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,280
lung uh physiology and that can lead to

1096
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,079
disease so it's a different pathway but

1097
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,920
you get S similar and results you know

1098
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:50,880
COPD uh hyper uh what's the last one

1099
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,880
hypers sensitive ponus yes yes so

1100
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,760
there's there's a lot of different um

1101
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,480
there's a lot of different uh your lungs

1102
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,240
can be hurt in lots of different ways it

1103
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,440
doesn't need to be biological it can be

1104
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:05,358
chemical it can be physical um but yeah

1105
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,639
the anytime there's a lot of particulate

1106
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:13,920
in the air um it's it's generally a good

1107
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:15,639
idea to wear uh like an n95 respirator

1108
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,440
um just to protect yourself from just

1109
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,838
the sheer amount that you're breathing

1110
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,440
in like your lungs can uh you know kind

1111
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:24,838
of clean that out uh for the most part

1112
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,000
but if they're really really fine

1113
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:29,880
particles and this is really the the um

1114
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,119
the important part when it comes to a

1115
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,280
health perspective really find

1116
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:38,280
particulate matter that's below about

1117
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,800
2.5 microns can go deep down into the

1118
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,079
lungs and even be directly absorbed into

1119
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,000
the bloodstream and so yes those can

1120
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:48,559
cause uh different pulmonary diseases

1121
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,838
over time but it's also linked to other

1122
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:55,359
systemic disease um that a lot of times

1123
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:57,599
doesn't get as much attention but uh for

1124
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,960
example there are several Publications

1125
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,119
out showing that exposure especially to

1126
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,639
these fine particulate matter uh species

1127
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,960
can um lead to neurod degenerative

1128
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,639
diseases and that is less well

1129
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,280
understood but it's it's definitely a

1130
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:13,838
whole body thing you know it's not just

1131
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,319
your lungs if they're really small they

1132
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:17,639
can get into your bloodstream travel to

1133
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:19,679
different parts of your body and if it's

1134
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:23,558
repeated exposure over a long period of

1135
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:25,759
time can lead to a diverse set of

1136
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:28,319
pathologies so the part of the paper

1137
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,960
that really caught my attention was the

1138
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:35,800
different sizes of these particular it's

1139
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:38,760
the the the top being say 10 Micron and

1140
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:42,000
then going down to the 2.5 Micron that

1141
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,559
you mentioned the smaller they get the

1142
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,800
more dangerous they are and so many of

1143
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:50,119
us are kind of like you know ah you got

1144
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,480
to cut just throw some mud on it and

1145
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:55,440
let's go you know kind of like like like

1146
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,000
let's not necessarily respect the damage

1147
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,880
that has been done to us it becomes way

1148
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,960
more sneaky when we're talking about

1149
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,280
inhaling things that are sub 10 Micron

1150
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,119
because we don't know what happening and

1151
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,519
it's very likely that since we don't

1152
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:13,720
know that it's happening at work we may

1153
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:17,480
blame it on you know our house or our

1154
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:19,519
bed sheets or our spouse's fragrance or

1155
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,358
all of these things when it's actually

1156
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,400
happening at work it's it's kind of like

1157
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,719
an invisible

1158
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,280
threat yeah yeah so the size of these

1159
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:30,879
particles is really

1160
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,319
uh it it's impactful from a a health

1161
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,760
perspective but also from just an

1162
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,400
aerosol science perspective so the

1163
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,160
smaller the particles are the longer

1164
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,559
they can stay floating around in the air

1165
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:42,078
as well so not only do you could you

1166
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,519
breed them in and they go deeper into

1167
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,960
your lungs but they're likely uh going

1168
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:47,960
to be more sustained exposure hazards

1169
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,039
because they're going to be floating

1170
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,920
around in the air for longer periods of

1171
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:55,358
time before gravity pulls them down and

1172
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,240
they deposit um onto the ground or onto

1173
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:01,480
the walls or whatever these particles

1174
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:04,838
end up uh uh it's called deposition in

1175
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,798
aerosol science so they end up falling

1176
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:10,400
essentially um and the bigger particles

1177
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:12,798
uh usually you know over 10 microns you

1178
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,240
know they will go up in the air and fall

1179
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:17,400
right back down but smaller you know

1180
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:20,118
around 10 microns and smaller they tend

1181
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,559
to stay in the air for minutes or even

1182
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,798
hours depending on how small they are so

1183
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,760
not only from uh Health perspective but

1184
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:29,358
also from a building science persp

1185
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,400
perspective the size of the particulates

1186
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:34,000
including their composition are really

1187
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,680
important when you're trying to

1188
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,880
understand the impacts um that these

1189
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:41,000
different particles can have on workers

1190
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,358
or on other folks in indoor environments

1191
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,119
in general and what's interesting is

1192
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:49,480
that you know the EPA the Environmental

1193
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,960
Protection Agency OSHA and and indoor

1194
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,838
air quality standards are all kind of

1195
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,920
they look at these particles slightly

1196
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:58,558
different um and so even though we're

1197
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,920
all trying to look at these particles

1198
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,798
and and assess how they could be harmful

1199
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,440
there's different binning of sizes and

1200
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:06,920
which categories may be most harmful uh

1201
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,838
depending on if you're looking at an

1202
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,760
environmental health perspective an

1203
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:13,159
occupational health perspective or just

1204
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,880
an indoor air quality perspective it's

1205
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:17,118
really interesting to have these three

1206
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,160
kind of different but overlapping Fields

1207
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,960
trying to uh assess these bio aerosols

1208
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,838
it's really troubling as a regenerative

1209
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,519
farmer who loves microbes to look at the

1210
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:30,440
microbes as any kind of an enemy right I

1211
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:33,039
mean like we we wear t-shirts you know I

1212
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,039
love microbes and microb farmer and all

1213
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:37,039
this right we love the microbes and

1214
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,719
we're usually spending our time like

1215
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,960
incubating them to create more of them

1216
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:43,919
to pour into the substrate to feed the

1217
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,519
soil so the soil can feed the

1218
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,119
plant and yet your paper talks about

1219
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:52,559
these pathogenic microbes um and and

1220
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:55,798
they are a human threat in our in our

1221
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,839
environments it's it is I mean it's

1222
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:00,920
obvious duh that it's true but it's also

1223
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:04,759
troubling that um that this type of

1224
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:08,680
biology that we are um in such support

1225
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:11,400
of also can be threat if they are of a

1226
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:14,199
pathogenic variety to a

1227
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,039
human yeah absolutely and you know I'm a

1228
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:19,159
big fan of microbes myself I'm a

1229
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:22,519
microbiologist I love fermented foods I

1230
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:23,920
um I definitely think that microbes uh

1231
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:26,679
you know they created the planet that

1232
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,798
we're on today and I appreciate that and

1233
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:31,358
and love them for that but they can also

1234
00:51:28,798 --> 00:51:34,400
a very small subset of them can directly

1235
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:36,199
cause disease and some of some microbes

1236
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,440
don't necessarily have to be pathogens

1237
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:40,399
to be harmful like I said some of their

1238
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,200
just their basic components their

1239
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,559
metabolites can actually uh trigger

1240
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,719
certain immune responses even though

1241
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:49,480
those microorganisms wouldn't

1242
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,798
necessarily infect you just the amount

1243
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,240
and the types of metabolites that they

1244
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:58,440
present could potentially be harmful so

1245
00:51:55,239 --> 00:52:01,318
Tess your research also focuses in on um

1246
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,639
microbial metabolites like endotoxin

1247
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:07,599
that just pound our immune system and uh

1248
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:10,400
the the the study uh research suggests

1249
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,160
that this is very common when we are

1250
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,760
grinding flour especially for pre-rolls

1251
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:17,000
and anybody who's ever been in that

1252
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,599
environment knows that you know when

1253
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,960
when when the uh material is getting

1254
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,079
ground it kind of just like permeates

1255
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,280
the whole room and if the doors are open

1256
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,440
it can go outside cuz CU unfortunately

1257
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,240
as as much as they're supposed to have

1258
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:34,200
good HVAC in these places many of them

1259
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:36,399
don't especially in states that are just

1260
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:39,239
becoming um you know cannibis

1261
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,680
normalizing so so tell us a little bit

1262
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:46,519
about um this endotoxin that is carried

1263
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:48,078
by the flower that gets um ground down

1264
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:51,480
into

1265
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,880
pre-rolls so endotoxins actually uh

1266
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,159
found on gram negative bacteria so if

1267
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,318
you remember you're you're basic micro

1268
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:02,879
101 um there's two different basically

1269
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:05,519
groups of bacteria and they're sort of

1270
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,160
uh organized by their cell walls and

1271
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,920
their cell membrane and how that's

1272
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:14,558
organized and um gram negative bacteria

1273
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:17,240
have something called endotoxin or LPS

1274
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:20,519
lipopolysaccharide and so flour that

1275
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:23,679
would have uh you know high levels of

1276
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:27,838
bacteria on them could potentially have

1277
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:29,759
a lot of endotoxin as well and there's

1278
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,880
uh really no peer-reviewed research

1279
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,799
studying that I mean we know that gram

1280
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,559
negative bacteria can definitely be on

1281
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:40,920
cannabis flour so it's likely that LPS

1282
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:43,079
or endotoxin is on cannabis flour um and

1283
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,400
there are some white papers out there

1284
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:47,519
that have shown and identified endotoxin

1285
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,160
on cannabis flow that's commercial uh

1286
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,400
within the state medicinal genomics I

1287
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:55,118
think put out that white paper last year

1288
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,680
um showing that you can identify

1289
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:01,280
endotoxin on cannabis flow that is

1290
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:03,960
commercially available to people and uh

1291
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,880
even in that report that came out about

1292
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:10,559
that fatal um occupational asthma attack

1293
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,960
in Massachusetts of a cannabis worker um

1294
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,880
the ocean investigators went in and they

1295
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,920
did some air sampling and they did find

1296
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:22,119
uh levels were elevated during um you

1297
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,440
know grinding operations in that room

1298
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:28,640
now that company had implemented HEPA

1299
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:30,760
filtration um after the the um worker

1300
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:33,279
suffered that fatal occupational asthma

1301
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,200
attack um and so it's not clear what the

1302
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,559
levels would have been uh that she would

1303
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:40,639
have been exposed to but um you know

1304
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,720
that could potentially and it doesn't

1305
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,798
have there's really no established oia

1306
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:47,959
standards for the amount of endotoxin

1307
00:54:45,798 --> 00:54:50,639
that uh you know someone can be exposed

1308
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,358
to quote unquote safely over an 8 Hour

1309
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:55,159
weighted period uh there's no OSHA

1310
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:57,679
standard for that we have to go off of

1311
00:54:55,159 --> 00:55:00,078
other countries um sort of limits to

1312
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,759
kind of gauge what is a potentially

1313
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,119
harmful level but that level is not

1314
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,480
going to be the same for every

1315
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:10,838
individual so it's it potentially

1316
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,039
harmful events could happen at uh at

1317
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:15,558
very low endotoxin levels for folks who

1318
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:18,279
may be particularly sensitive to that

1319
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:20,720
and so um in the handful of studies that

1320
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:24,319
look at endotoxin in different cannabis

1321
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:26,078
and hemp environments um the levels in

1322
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,880
cannabis environments and granted this

1323
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,760
is like you know maybe three to five

1324
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,838
papers that have come out on this so

1325
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:37,280
it's very small in scope um they're not

1326
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:40,000
super high in cannabis operations but

1327
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,798
they were very high in hemp uh

1328
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,559
operations and that could be just the

1329
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,798
difference between growing indoor versus

1330
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,079
outdoor it could be how these operations

1331
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:50,798
are running um it could have just been

1332
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,160
the luck of the draw you know roll the

1333
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:54,838
dice and some will be high and some will

1334
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:56,920
be low again the sample size is very low

1335
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:59,719
so that is definitely warrant it

1336
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,440
warrants a lot more investigation on uh

1337
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:04,399
what kind of endotoxin levels are

1338
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,519
actually in the air um during especially

1339
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,079
during processing of these dry flowed

1340
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:11,719
products I want to end this set talking

1341
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:13,359
about bio aerosol synergies because you

1342
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:15,719
make this interesting point during the

1343
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,960
on the during the paper of that there

1344
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:20,959
are these you know these various fungal

1345
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,318
bacteria and viral bar bio aerosols and

1346
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,480
they all kind of impact humans in

1347
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:29,558
different ways but oh yeah when they get

1348
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,240
together and party in your immune system

1349
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:33,280
like it can cause something entirely

1350
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:35,399
different so will you speak briefly to

1351
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,319
these these synergies and how when when

1352
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,358
these different aerosols work together

1353
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:42,679
they they can be made all the

1354
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:45,920
worse yeah so anyone who studies biology

1355
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:48,480
knows it's usually not like a plus or a

1356
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,880
to B to C you know it's it's very

1357
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:55,440
complex there's usually these these um

1358
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,200
uh very interesting relationships and

1359
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,119
feed forward and feedback Pathways and

1360
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:04,439
interactions between different um you

1361
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:07,000
know biological processes that can

1362
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,639
create a end results that you don't

1363
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,599
expect based on what went into it and so

1364
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:14,038
uh for example some of these bio

1365
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,760
aerosols um can definitely synergize

1366
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:18,599
with each other you know endotoxin can

1367
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,480
synergize with other toxins and

1368
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:24,280
exacerbate uh different negative Health

1369
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:26,798
outcomes in mice um you can see uh

1370
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:31,079
enhanced sensitization so that's

1371
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:33,318
uh that's that kind of classic U IG

1372
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,880
mediated which is that allergen that's

1373
00:57:33,318 --> 00:57:36,519
that branch of the immune system that

1374
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,920
really focuses on those protein

1375
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:42,440
allergens if you're allergic to other

1376
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,280
plants that have similar proteins to

1377
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,000
cannabis that can actually sensitize you

1378
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,839
um and and you can have a greater

1379
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,960
likelihood of becoming allergic to

1380
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:54,239
cannabis so a lot of The Growers that I

1381
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,920
talk to um who are sensitized because I

1382
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:58,318
do know several who are um we'll say

1383
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,798
that when there's a lot of pollen

1384
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,838
outside they actually uh notice that

1385
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:05,960
their their allergies inside the grow

1386
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:07,719
are worse and it's not clear why that is

1387
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,318
or what's going on there but it's likely

1388
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:10,919
that there's some cross- sensitization

1389
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:12,719
that's going on there and so these

1390
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,119
bioaerosols have complex uh

1391
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:16,239
relationships and that's why it's so

1392
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:17,599
important to not only just be like okay

1393
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,798
these are the number of particles in the

1394
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,720
air and the sizes that they are but

1395
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:25,599
taking a deeper dive into you know what

1396
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:27,239
organisms are there what metabolites are

1397
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,599
there what allergens are there what

1398
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:31,598
toxins are there and and really

1399
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:35,760
understanding how the

1400
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:38,200
diverse uh uh kind of I would say bio

1401
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,720
aerosol oh because we love to add M to

1402
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:44,239
everything in science um could be uh

1403
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:48,639
leading to some of these potential

1404
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:51,199
effects now drawing that um that causal

1405
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,879
relationship between exposure to a

1406
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:55,399
particular group of different bio

1407
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,640
aerosols and disease is very challenging

1408
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,680
again because

1409
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,318
it there could be a lot of different

1410
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:00,838
things in the air the amount that's

1411
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:03,159
there and the amount that you're exposed

1412
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:05,239
plus your own genetic predisposition is

1413
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:07,239
going to play a big role in that but

1414
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:08,598
it's known that these aerosols and just

1415
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:10,798
the different components of these bio

1416
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:12,519
aerosols can interact with each other

1417
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,838
and really exacerbate negative Health

1418
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:16,400
outcomes that's really great net test

1419
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:18,119
well well this isn't really really great

1420
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,400
that's really awful but your explanation

1421
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,358
is really great so so um let's go ahead

1422
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,200
and take a short break and be right back

1423
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:27,000

on sharing what I've learned in a way

1536
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:38,719
that you can replicate it in your own

Shango Los and my guest today is

1544
01:03:53,318 --> 01:03:58,960
microbiologist Tess Edom so Tess you

1545
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:01,399
know some of these bio aerosols end up

1546
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,920
in concentrate products which are then

1547
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:07,639
inhaled is it primarily inhaled products

1548
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:10,559
like Dab Oil that are at risk of passing

1549
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:13,679
on some of these these toxins or do we

1550
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:16,720
find an inges risk in ethanol extracted

1551
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:18,038
full extract oils like RSO or or crude

1552
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,399
or something like that that's going to

1553
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:22,240
be

1554
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,960
eaten that is a great question um you

1555
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,598
know with the way so these bio aerosols

1556
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,960
are generated in these cannabis

1557
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:30,559
environments but the the organisms can

1558
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,039
also be on the plant matter like you

1559
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,599
said it can also settle from the

1560
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:38,480
environment onto the plant matter um and

1561
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,798
uh and that could carry over onto the

1562
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,318
product and that's really interesting

1563
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:45,519
that you bring up concentrates because

1564
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:47,719
some of these uh like endotox and some

1565
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:50,639
of these microbial metabolites are

1566
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:52,959
pretty fat soluble So in theory they

1567
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:56,278
would carry over with a pretty

1568
01:04:52,960 --> 01:05:00,278
hydrophobic molecule like you know THC

1569
01:04:56,278 --> 01:05:02,199
and thca and and CBD and cbda um during

1570
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:04,278
these different types of extraction

1571
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:08,318
processes um especially if you're using

1572
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:11,920
organic solvents um now will they end up

1573
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:14,119
being intact and able to cause harm in

1574
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,680
an individual that is not clear and

1575
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:18,440
really there's no uh for some of these

1576
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:21,159
things there's really no testing that's

1577
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:24,039
done so like endotoxin and which is

1578
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:27,960
Again part of those bacterial uh cell

1579
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:30,920
membranes or there's there's other uh

1580
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:35,000
types of cell membranes from fungi that

1581
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:37,159
contain um beta glucans which can also

1582
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,679
cause harm when breathed in it's another

1583
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:41,719
uh component of Bio aerosols uh if you

1584
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:45,318
have a lot of fungal contamination will

1585
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:47,439
those uh carry over onto uh your

1586
01:05:45,318 --> 01:05:49,440
extracts and that those are not really

1587
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,519
being studied uh so for compliance

1588
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:55,119
testing it's not required to look at

1589
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:58,679
that and so um it's it's there's really

1590
01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:01,440
no r being performed in this area um so

1591
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:04,199
we don't really know now

1592
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:07,440
myotoxins uh could potentially carry

1593
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:10,358
over and concentrate but we only really

1594
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,200
test for a handful of myotoxins um

1595
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:14,358
mostly that are produced by aspergillis

1596
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:16,519
and penicilium species but we don't test

1597
01:06:14,358 --> 01:06:19,199
for other types of toxins that are

1598
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:21,358
produced by plant pathogens uh like

1599
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:23,798
fusarium which could potentially include

1600
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,199
some pretty severe toxins um and we

1601
01:06:23,798 --> 01:06:28,318
don't test for that so we just don't

1602
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:30,278
know it's a big black box um and so it

1603
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,558
could potentially carry over and that's

1604
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,639
something that we're really interested

1605
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:35,278
in from both the concentrate and on the

1606
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:37,519
flour you know during

1607
01:06:35,278 --> 01:06:42,079
combustion um or during drier

1608
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:44,318
vaporization of flour um are these uh

1609
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,119
you know biological components destroyed

1610
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:51,119
you know you're heating up to like 400°

1611
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:54,960
C or you're vaporizing at like 180c or

1612
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:57,400
150c um and you know are you going to

1613
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,400
destroy the biological components or is

1614
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,278
it going to just aerosolize them and

1615
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,559
generate new bio aerosols that now

1616
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:05,920
contain these potentially bioactive

1617
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:07,760
agents we don't know no one has really

1618
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,519
done any research on that in cannabis

1619
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,720
but there is research that's that has

1620
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:15,719
been done on Tobacco that has shown that

1621
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:19,358
endotoxin can carry over into tobacco

1622
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:21,159
smoke and some scientists do hypothesize

1623
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:23,920
that that

1624
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:27,399
endotoxin that is now in BIO aerosols

1625
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,400
generated during combustion are uh that

1626
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,838
it contributes to some of these uh lung

1627
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,079
diseases that we see in cannabis smokers

1628
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:38,038
especially those that are more

1629
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:40,119
inflamatory based um like COPD so uh

1630
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:42,400
it's it's not clear in cannabis uh there

1631
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:44,440
was one paper that was uh published in

1632
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,358
the 80s that showed that aspila spores

1633
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:50,200
could carry over in uh cannabis joint

1634
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:52,119
into the smoke so clearly it doesn't and

1635
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:54,719
and they were viable at the very end so

1636
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:57,119
they could form a colony forming unit so

1637
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:59,199
it's clear that these biological

1638
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,519
components can transfer over from flow

1639
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:03,159
into smoke but we just don't know the

1640
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,318
extent of that you know how much of it

1641
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:07,838
carries over is it

1642
01:08:05,318 --> 01:08:09,639
0.00001% of of what's on the flower it

1643
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:11,960
carries over or is it a much bigger

1644
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:14,920
chunk than that we just don't know and

1645
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:19,198
there's really no uh um research being

1646
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:21,399
done on that as far as I know um and uh

1647
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:25,119
as a academic researcher at a federally

1648
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:28,119
funded institution um unfortunately even

1649
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:31,158
if cannabis is rescheduled to schedule 3

1650
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:34,158
drug even if I had a DEA schedule 1 or

1651
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:36,278
schedule 3 license I still can't go out

1652
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,879
and pick up commercial cannabis from my

1653
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,400
state so I couldn't walk down the street

1654
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,880
to one of the many dispensaries in

1655
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:45,158
Boulder grab flour and bring it back to

1656
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:47,199
my federally funded lab because that is

1657
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:50,798
illegal even if I have a DEA schedule

1658
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:54,759
license I can only source cannabis from

1659
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:56,560
uh a DEA registered uh naida producer so

1660
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:59,359
which is not representative of the stuff

1661
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,000
that's actually being sold at retail

1662
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,920
exactly and that's a big challenge um

1663
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,920
you know for academic researchers who

1664
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,719
want to ask these questions it's really

1665
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,399
hard we can only study you know

1666
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:10,880
University of Mississippi flower and I

1667
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:12,639
think there's maybe six or seven other

1668
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:16,000
approved vendors across the United

1669
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:18,798
States and um from an from a consumer

1670
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,319
safety perspective that is uh very

1671
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:21,838
frustrating because I want to know

1672
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,279
what's on that flow and I want to know

1673
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:26,119
what carries over into smoke um and then

1674
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:27,640
on the concentrate side we really don't

1675
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:29,238
know there's some work that's done on

1676
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:32,079
like the heavy metals that can be

1677
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:34,919
generated um and when pesticides are

1678
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:36,359
combusted um like how what does that

1679
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,640
result in there's some work on that

1680
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:40,440
especially in tobacco but on

1681
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,920
concentrates there's really not that

1682
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:46,119
much that's understood about the diverse

1683
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,039
different types of microbial metabolites

1684
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:50,798
that could be in there outside of you

1685
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:54,439
know the five or so mot toxins that are

1686
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,679
tested for um as part of regulatory

1687
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:57,079
measures but there's hundreds and

1688
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,800
hundreds and hundreds of different Moto

1689
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:00,279
toxins there's endotoxin there's all

1690
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,400
sorts of other bits and pieces that

1691
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:04,559
we're not really looking at and so I

1692
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:07,000
think that that's an area of research

1693
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,679
that that really needs uh funding and

1694
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,560
and there has to be some leeway there

1695
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,719
for researchers to be able to actually

1696
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:17,080
study uh product that's out on the

1697
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:20,600
market that people are using yeah for as

1698
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:22,719
popular as dabbing is it is uh amazing

1699
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,440
that that this research hasn't been done

1700
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,880
yet and there's so many people that

1701
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:29,678
could potentially be at very serious

1702
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,159
risk and we just don't know yet so so

1703
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,440
Tess I want to end with these two

1704
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:37,319
questions um the first of the two is you

1705
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:40,359
know we've talked a lot about the threat

1706
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:43,000
that cannabis workers are under at

1707
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:46,319
work what advice do you have for

1708
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,520
cannabis workers um who do work in an

1709
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:51,679
indoor cannabis environment on what they

1710
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,560
should do best to protect themselves

1711
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:56,279
because they you know they they love

1712
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:58,360
working in cannabis and they feel that

1713
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:00,800
you know working in cannabis is a is a

1714
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:03,079
meaningful role to play but we don't

1715
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:06,880
want them to be putting themselves at

1716
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:09,640
risk to be um a participant in this so

1717
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:13,319
so what what action should they

1718
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:15,880
take yeah so I think that you know if a

1719
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:18,399
cannabis worker is noticing that they

1720
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:21,640
are having you know shortness of breath

1721
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:24,039
uh while they're working or you know uh

1722
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:26,039
and I know I know probably a dozen folks

1723
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:27,719
who who've had these types of

1724
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:30,319
respiratory issues when working with

1725
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:32,520
plant that um they should definitely

1726
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,960
talk to if they have a safety officer

1727
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,760
internally they should talk to them they

1728
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:39,439
should talk to their supervisor um and

1729
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:42,159
they should also uh go to the doctor and

1730
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:44,919
and be referred to an allergist and see

1731
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:47,799
if they have allergies to cannabis or

1732
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,960
molds um sometimes it's very challenging

1733
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:53,119
to get these cannabis extracts to do

1734
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:54,800
like skin prick tests on uh folks and in

1735
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:57,158
different states it can be very

1736
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,760
challenging to to be able to determine

1737
01:11:57,158 --> 01:12:00,759
if you do have allergies towards

1738
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:03,239
cannabis because of the ferally illegal

1739
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:05,840
status even of these cannabis extracts

1740
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:08,879
that are used for skin prick tests um

1741
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,480
and so I would recommend you know really

1742
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,480
making sure that you are bringing your

1743
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:15,959
concerns to your supervisors to your

1744
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:18,359
safety officers um make sure that you

1745
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,520
are wearing an n95 if you do notice you

1746
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:23,000
have that respiratory distress and

1747
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:25,440
really try to figure out what it is that

1748
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,238
could be uh leading to this at least go

1749
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:30,439
to an allergist and and do some basic

1750
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:32,000
skin prick tests to see if you uh do

1751
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:34,839
have any sensitization to anything that

1752
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,719
could be in that environment um and

1753
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:39,159
because yeah I mean uh there was one

1754
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,880
study that Nash conducted on these 10

1755
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:42,799
workers in the state of Washington and

1756
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,319
they followed them they had different

1757
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,320
occupational asthma related uh issues

1758
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,599
and I think it was over the course of a

1759
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:53,599
year or so and uh this Nash study

1760
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,280
followed these workers and ultimately

1761
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,520
unfortunately

1762
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:59,679
10 workers ended up having to quit their

1763
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,639
jobs because they couldn't do the work

1764
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:04,719
anymore so maybe you could ask to be

1765
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:06,400
reassigned to a different job Duty um

1766
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,000
especially if it's getting worse and

1767
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:10,479
worse if you want to stay in the

1768
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,719
Cannabis space but yeah I mean once you

1769
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:16,638
develop uh a sensitization or you know

1770
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,960
um you have these exposures sometimes if

1771
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:21,279
you develop that it stays with you the

1772
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,600
rest of your life so it really sounds

1773
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:25,679
like people should be wearing the n95s

1774
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,039
even if they're not having a trouble yet

1775
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,520
since you're saying that it's acquired

1776
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:31,039
you know if somebody loves working in

1777
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,600
cannabis it sounds like they should

1778
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,479
start wearing a mask even when they

1779
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,920
don't have a problem so they don't

1780
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,519
develop a problem mean could it

1781
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,520
definitely couldn't hurt I'm a big fan

1782
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,080
of masking um it definitely couldn't

1783
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,840
hurt another thing they could do is

1784
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:47,079
start advocating for basic indoor air

1785
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,159
quality monitoring there are very

1786
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:51,719
lowcost monitors that can they won't

1787
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:53,799
tell you what's in the air but they'll

1788
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:56,480
tell you how many particles of different

1789
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:58,679
sizes are in the air they monitor like

1790
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,879
voc's um and they also monitor

1791
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:01,440
temperature and humidity so you can

1792
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,199
Network those and get kind of like an

1793
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:06,519
internet of things going and realtime

1794
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:08,039
monitoring up and running to evaluate uh

1795
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,320
the air quality in there but it's also

1796
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:11,679
good for other important parameters like

1797
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:13,359
temperature and humidity which you also

1798
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:15,800
want to be dialed in for your grow

1799
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:18,000
anyway so that's another way that you

1800
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,480
know a a company can start looking at

1801
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,198
their air quality and you know putting

1802
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:24,879
in additional filtration making sure

1803
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:26,919
that they're really getting you know

1804
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,800
what recommended as far as air exchange

1805
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:32,359
rates per hour um and making sure that

1806
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,000
they're taking some of these engineering

1807
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:37,759
controls too a mask is great but it's

1808
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,520
really that last kind of line of defense

1809
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,920
you know there's other things that uh

1810
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:45,520
you can do in the hierarchy of controls

1811
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:47,079
to protect uh workers in these spaces so

1812
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,040
good air filtration making sure you're

1813
01:14:47,079 --> 01:14:53,559
getting your air exchange rates up there

1814
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:55,319
um and uh monitoring those environments

1815
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,719
can be really helpful so that you're

1816
01:14:55,319 --> 01:14:59,279
avoiding these high levels um so that

1817
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:01,119
you don't necessarily have to wear a

1818
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,719
mask because now you're you're

1819
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:05,880
controlling those at the source

1820
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:07,960
excellent I love that Sol short-term

1821
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:10,719
solutions for cannabis workers and

1822
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:13,560
longer term solutions for managers of

1823
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,239
cannabis facilities who who want their

1824
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,120
who want to keep their employees safe

1825
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:20,158
while not necessarily overspending I

1826
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:22,479
love it and that's great yeah yeah so um

1827
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:24,839
so Tess thank you so much for joining us

1828
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:27,759
today here on shaping fire you know this

1829
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:30,119
is is a while while this is an an easy

1830
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:33,719
topic for you as a scientist I think

1831
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:35,840
that those of us who you know have been

1832
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:39,319
in love with cannabis for years and are

1833
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:41,920
are so used to defending cannabis from

1834
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:44,198
all the haters that we we never want to

1835
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,560
say that there's anything bad or

1836
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:49,879
potentially dangerous about cannabis and

1837
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,639
and you know after after doing this for

1838
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,039
as long as I have I I have to say

1839
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:56,440
unfortunately when you know cannabis can

1840
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:59,279
be a threat we have to stay aware of it

1841
01:15:56,439 --> 01:16:03,000
even though it may also be a sacred

1842
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:05,399
plant to us um also uh I understand that

1843
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,800
this is a pretty um this is this is an

1844
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:10,238
opinion here but it also is not lost on

1845
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:14,679
me that the harms from Cannabis come

1846
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:18,198
from a indoor growing where regenerative

1847
01:16:14,679 --> 01:16:21,119
is so often outdoor growing and B is

1848
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:24,519
this is all worse at scale when we all

1849
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:26,519
tend to love craft and so I'm not saying

1850
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,520
that we that that that large scale

1851
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,920
indoor can't be grown in a safe way

1852
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,639
that's not what I'm saying but I am

1853
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,158
saying that gosh it does seem to be um a

1854
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:36,039
bit more evidence for outdoor

1855
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:39,319
regenerative growing

1856
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:42,000
so so so Tess thank you so much for for

01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:49,158
to give us a little bit of theorizing

1860
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:50,960
mixed in with your hard data so that you

1861
01:16:49,158 --> 01:16:53,000
know here at the beginning of this kind

1862
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:56,158
of research we can understand what the

1863
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,119
data might be meaning better than than

1864
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:59,839
than just the raw data itself you've

1865
