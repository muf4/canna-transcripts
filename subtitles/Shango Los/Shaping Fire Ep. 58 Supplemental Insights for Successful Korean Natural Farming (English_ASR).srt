he was only a few years ago that organic

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,849
cannabis growers were rare everybody was

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,980
still on the bottle of giving their

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,320
plants synthetic inputs instead of whole

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,969
foods now though there are a whole lot

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,589
of people in the scene who are growing

8
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,929
and thinking more holistically about the

9
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,420
plant and realizing that our job as

10
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,698
cultivators is more to promote good soil

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,010
and rhizosphere health than it is to

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,510
force-feed the plant nutrients and that

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,940
it's better for us to work intimately in

14
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,120
cooperation with nature then try to bend

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,558
her to our will to create flowers it's

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,718
cool that growth store staff are

17
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,089
educating themselves to where once

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,000
everyone was talking hydro more people

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,219
are talking myko natural farming is the

20

investment to shaping fire for only a

65
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,459
fraction of what it would cost you to

attend just one convention you can

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,469
advertise for nearly a year on shaping

68
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,910
fire it has been a busy week as other

69
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:34,680
companies have reached out to shaping

70
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,599
fire because their whole year of

71
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,610
customer outreach events was just

72
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,859
cancelled and they are scrambling for

73
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,350
new ways to reach their customers the

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,870
audience for shaping fire is made up of

75
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:48,389
curious and enthusiastic cannabis

76
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,849
enthusiasts entrepreneurs and home

77
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:53,509
growers and you can reach them for less

78
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:57,000
than the price of a postcard each email

79
00:02:53,509 --> 00:03:00,209
hotspot at shaping fire calm to find out

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,180
more you are listening to shaping fire

81
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,219
and I'm your host Shango lows today my

82
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,719
guest is certified at Korean natural

83
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,789
farming instructor Drake

84
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,650
I asked Drake about his one name name

85
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,650
and he explained that Drake is actually

86
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,569
his middle name Eric Drake why nerd I

87
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,489
decide to include that because I can't

88
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,280
be the only one wondering about his name

89
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,620
Drake is the most certified instructor

90
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,569
of KNF in the United States he's been

91
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,849
studying Korean natural farming for over

92
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,789
10 years and is certified by Master Choa

93
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:32,189
he hosts a podcast called microbial

94
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:35,039
secret society that is established on

95
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:36,719
KNF ideals but then goes in every

96
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,419
direction covering really interesting

97
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,039
topics today on shaping fire we're going

98
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,259
to talk about wild crafting and

99
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,479
fermentations in both natural and urban

100
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,099
environments some ideas for collecting

101
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,738
IMO under less than ideal circumstances

102
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,359
and in the third set we ask Drake a

103
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,539
bunch of questions that shaping fire

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,930
audience sent us in to ask him welcome

105
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:59,639
to the show Drake hey Aloha Shango it's

106
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,989
right to be with you awesome man thank

107
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,139
you for sharing some of your valuable

108
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,519
time with us I know a farm life is

109
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:07,529
exceptionally busy so I'm glad that

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,539
you're able to join us for awhile so

111
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,709
let's get started by setting some

112
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:16,529
context you know a lot of folks focus on

113
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,350
the net Korean natural farming recipes

114
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:21,238
only and many folks don't consider what

115
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,669
I would say this is a bigger picture of

116
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,138
what natural farming and in this case

117
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:29,019
Korean natural farming really is

118
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,780
because of that I see lots of people dog

119
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:34,568
idli following recipes but without a

120
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:37,778
deeper understanding for example of why

121
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:39,908
we use the fresh new growth tips on

122
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:42,939
plants when making fermented plant juice

123
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:45,728
so so each aspect of K and that fits

124
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:48,159
into this larger overall framework or

125
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:50,949
philosophy of working with nature

126
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:53,288
instead of against it will you tell us a

127
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,930
little bit about how you envisioned the

128
00:04:53,288 --> 00:05:00,728
holistic aspect of this sort of farming

129
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:03,610
thought well if you yeah I will and if

130
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:07,180
you look at my the way I've been kind of

131
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,658
translating and and bringing the aspects

132
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,939
of Korean natural farming into a Western

133
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:16,120
language and also Western mindset has

134
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:19,838
been going at these solutions and

135
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,028
largely I've I've kind of helped helped

136
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:24,129
out by isolating it down to nine core

137
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:26,889
solutions where there is many more

138
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:29,199
solutions than this but by by getting it

139
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,360
down to nine those are the essentials

140
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,819
you need to grow to to get you know the

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,098
basics of everything and I've really

142
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:38,500
been working on the language of how

143
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:40,930
these things are translated so when

144
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,598
Korean natural farming came over from

145
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,668
Korea into the the Western world and

146
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:48,788
largely the the first place it entered

147
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:54,158
was Hawaii it came with a lot of jargon

148
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:56,259
so you have FPGA FF j la be o HN and if

149
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:58,509
someone's brand new to this it's it's

150
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,270
they have to absorb not only the the

151
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:03,189
jargon you know it's it but but

152
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:05,889
understanding the intricacies of each

153
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,169
recipe and so so what I've been doing is

154
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:10,740
I've been translating the recipes not

155
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:13,028
not changing them by any means but just

156
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,000
translating them differently so instead

157
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:17,769
of for instance calling fermented plant

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,199
juice fermented plant juice which is

159
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:22,149
kind of the way it's made you ferment

160
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,088
plant juice but instead I've been

161
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:27,968
renaming it to be like Korean natural

162
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:31,300
farming food because then when you go to

163
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:33,038
apply these things if you go like you

164
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,379
know when should you use form any plant

165
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,930
juice it's kind of a mystery but if I

166
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:40,040
ask you when should you use food it

167
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,600
becomes pretty darn clear like

168
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,510
when you're when your plant is hungry

169
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,980
right mm-hmm and and so largely that's

170
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,939
that's what I've been doing with with

171
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:52,280
these recipes is is deej are getting

172
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:55,009
them and translating them in a way that

173
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,229
it helps to make it more intuitive so

174
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,879
that people going to jump in and they

175
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,550
want to use these things and they want

176
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,949
to find like how do these components fit

177
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,620
together if it's just jargon and you

178
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,779
don't understand you kind of have to

179
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,079
blindly follow recipes or trust these

180
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:13,609
other things but once the language is

181
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,209
there where you can conceptually

182
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,189
understand things where you say okay

183
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:21,199
fermented plant juices food then you can

184
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,810
understand well if my plant looks really

185
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,899
well-fed maybe I don't need as much food

186
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,569
and you can start to understand like how

187
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:32,359
the components that the individual

188
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:35,180
recipes actually build a full farming

189
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,379
system I like that approach and and

190
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,110
honestly it's a different approach than

191
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:40,279
I thought you were gonna give me when I

192
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,060
asked the question I thought you were

193
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,859
gonna give me

194
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,899
actually more like highfalutin

195
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,490
philosophy because you know so often

196
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:51,439
philosophy is where vocabulary often

197
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,639
gets its meaning right but you actually

198
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,519
went the other way with it

199
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,740
which I find kind of juicy the fact that

200
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,180
you're all like we'll listen let's let's

201
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:04,579
make the the words we use to talk about

202
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,579
this process that we're doing let's

203
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:10,430
let's take it out of some of the jargon

204
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:12,800
that may be traditional but which kind

205
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,319
of scare eliza's the process and and

206
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,550
kind of devoid some of it of direction

207
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:22,849
or meaning and so let's let's rebrand it

208
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,710
in more useful ways so that it gives a

209
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,090
different kind of context and that

210
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,449
sounds really that sounds really

211
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:32,209
attractive do you find that either

212
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:34,700
yourself or yourself to your students or

213
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,479
your students after your classes that

214
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:41,210
they have challenges using your new

215
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,700
vocabulary when say other peoples on

216
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,340
other people on a an Internet thread

217
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,250
maybe using the traditional Korean

218
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,830
shorthand

219
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,029
well III I do both right I try to I try

220
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,950
to teach you know true like

221
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:57,809
conceptually like when you when you

222
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,610
understand I mean the way I call things

223
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:02,219
it's like food medicine cleanser

224
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,039
structure reproduction all those words

225
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,590
just it takes the mystery out of how do

226
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,139
you use it but but at the same time you

227
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,639
need backwards compatibility right so

228
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,279
you still need to know like okay

229
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:17,399
medicine is Oh H n which stands for

230
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,289
oriental herbal nutrient which when I go

231
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,019
on the forums and things and I go on the

232
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:25,409
internet I find people will say yeah but

233
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:28,199
what about my Oh H M am being like M

234
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:30,089
there's no OAH M you know but they're

235
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,680
thinking oriental herbal medicine

236
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,009
they're not thinking oriental herbal

237
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,349
nutrient how it was in the original text

238
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:40,350
but but with my experience with what

239
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,779
I've seen is the first translations of

240
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,690
Korean natural farming were kind of

241
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,669
arbitrary and in it and they just you

242
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,580
know decided to call something fermented

243
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:52,589
plant juice in the English translation

244
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,960
but if you go to Master Choa and he's

245
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:58,740
talking about it what he's actually

246
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,070
saying is he calls it green juice from

247
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:08,240
heaven okay but but that's not in the

248
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:10,860
books we don't we don't use our GJ f H

249
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,629
but but then but but in the English

250
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,060
translation all sudden we got fpj and

251
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,100
then that becomes our jargon and so I I

252
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,989
realize this it through the translation

253
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,080
that there there wasn't like a ton of

254
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,960
thought put into how they were naming

255
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,509
things in in across languages it's not

256
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,980
even the same so when we in America all

257
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:30,689
of a sudden when you pick up this jargon

258
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,990
language because that's how we first

259
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:36,120
received it I believe that right now is

260
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,180
the time to clarify this so that we have

261
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,820
a language that that's intuitive for

262
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:44,009
usage because because originally the the

263
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,020
the names were made for intuitive to

264
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:48,149
make because it was so important to make

265
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,919
the ingredients but now that people are

266
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,110
making them and they're available it's

267
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,169
it's more important to me to see

268
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,269
prioritization on application and where

269
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:59,370
it's intuitive application so I don't

270
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:01,230
need to teach you as much like if you

271
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,299
get food you know when to use food and

272
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,279
when not to I don't have to tell you you

273
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,990
know this dose this or that you it's it

274
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,379
becomes your

275
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:13,200
it's your thing that I give to you right

276
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,700
on so so let's go back to my first

277
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,920
question I'm gonna ask it to you a

278
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,800
slightly different way to try to tease

279
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,349
out some different meaning and this is

280
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:25,708
how I asked at this time is that so

281
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,620
often people who have been growing

282
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:31,649
cannabis and food crops they are used to

283
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:36,320
thinking about you know not only NPK

284
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:42,000
style nutrient mentality but but more so

285
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:46,470
I'm going to put nutrients on this plant

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,919
and I am going to make it grow and it is

287
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:55,620
kind of in service to me and there's not

288
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:57,409
a lot of thought given to by-product

289
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,089
like run off and things like that

290
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:03,480
whereas when someone first starts

291
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:05,880
studying natural farming they realize

292
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,009
that oh there's there's actually a whole

293
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:11,429
bunch of recycling taking place you know

294
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm I'm using other plants that are at

295
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:18,179
their highest growth potential to feed

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,149
my target plants that I want to use my

297
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:26,639
preparations with and now because I'm

298
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:29,850
not using you know intense chemicals or

299
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,240
nutrients of any type my runoff is now

300
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,629
not only not bad but it is it is clean

301
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,329
and beneficial to the folks downstream

302
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:42,570
so when when you are first trying to get

303
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:45,659
people over that hump of this is how you

304
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,670
may have been taught to farm but now

305
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:51,088
we're going to be thinking about it in

306
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:53,699
this new holistic way what are some of

307
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,760
the examples or tricks that you have

308
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,270
found really bring people along with you

309
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:03,208
on why natural farming is is

310
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:07,679
holistically and mentally different than

311
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:11,069
traditional farming okay yeah so I like

312
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:13,528
I like that question of you know how to

313
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,100
bring people along with that I I think

314
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:18,659
um

315
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,819
I think initially if you know I I listen

316
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,379
to a bunch of shows in in in

317
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:24,028
especially in cannabis growing you know

318
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:27,209
it's always I always see these questions

319
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:29,838
about I have I have this deficiency what

320
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:32,758
do I add to my plant and it's this real

321
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:37,529
relationship between grower and plant a

322
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:39,028
in tightly coupled whereas the different

323
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:41,249
paradigm that you bring in with Korean

324
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:43,499
natural farming is that I'm the grower

325
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:45,600
but I'm not directly interfacing with

326
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:48,959
the plant between me and the plant are

327
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,149
these microorganisms and so the micro or

328
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,268
so if I'm gonna you know my plant shows

329
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:56,639
some deficiency I would then feed the

330
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:58,889
microbes a certain thing that then they

331
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,678
would exude it in a plant available form

332
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,659
to be available for the plant and I know

333
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:05,698
your audience is pretty well familiar

334
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:08,728
familiar with Elena gum and the soil

335
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:11,338
food web and this whole idea of biology

336
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:13,019
and living soils so it's it's really in

337
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,899
Korean natural farming we're taking that

338
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,089
approach to that it's not just like like

339
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:22,470
like for me when I go out to my plant

340
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:24,359
I'm not trying to juice my plant and get

341
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,709
the most out of my plant what I'm trying

342
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:32,549
to do is build the richest most dank

343
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:35,728
fungal you know balanced soil that I can

344
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:37,798
get the most thriving living soil I can

345
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:40,350
get and then I know when I sew a seed

346
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:42,600
into there that almost every deficiency

347
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,729
is going to be taken care of because the

348
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,220
microbes are are this interface between

349
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:49,470
me and the plant so so I'm not trying to

350
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,809
target exactly like juice my plant but

351
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,329
I'm more trying to create balance in the

352
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:57,238
ecosystem which then the natural result

353
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:58,858
is a thriving plant and so I think when

354
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:00,749
people understand that there's an

355
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:03,600
interface between you and the plant

356
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:05,759
which is the microorganisms then it

357
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,850
leads to a bigger understanding of this

358
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,399
of where you mentioned like runoff in

359
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:14,009
going into the ocean you realize how the

360
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,499
whole soil is alive and living in and

361
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:19,350
can process toxins and and create

362
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:21,569
fertility in and then that just brings

363
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:25,009
you to a bigger how how you're more

364
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:27,208
connected to to everything I like that

365
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,589
explanation and it reminds me a lot when

366
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,258
I was very first getting into

367
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:34,049
understanding organic farming you know

368
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:37,649
some 10-15 years ago fifteen years ago I

369
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:40,288
got turned on to the the farmer and

370
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:43,109
speaker Joel Salatin and and he you know

371
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:44,788
he raises meat products on his farm

372
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,408
there Polyface farm but he always said

373
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:48,058
you know I'm not a chicken farmer I'm

374
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:51,119
not a cow farmer I'm not a pig farmer

375
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:54,328
I'm a grass farmer and he's always like

376
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:57,329
so long as I'm got healthy soil and I'm

377
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:59,788
growing healthy grass then everything

378
00:15:57,328 --> 00:16:02,698
that lives on that grass is going to be

379
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:05,548
healthier and more resistant to disease

380
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:08,008
and all that that's often how I think

381
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:09,808
about working with the microbes and

382
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,839
natural farming as well it's like listen

383
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:17,988
my job is not to grow the plant my job

384
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:20,220
is to grow really vibrant soil

385
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:23,489
jam-packed with microbes so that

386
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:26,309
whatever the plant desires is they're in

387
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:28,949
some sort of buffet and I like that idea

388
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:31,168
that you that you propose that you know

389
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:33,298
it's that the the microbes are kind of

390
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:36,088
like this this go-between between the

391
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:37,528
plant and and myself because we don't we

392
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,449
don't really do a very good job when we

393
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:42,418
try to interact with the plant directly

394
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:45,208
by feeding the plant but if we feed

395
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:49,019
everything in the in the rhizosphere

396
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:51,778
well then the plant is is by natural

397
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,220
course gonna be healthy and that's

398
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,558
that's totally true and that and that's

399
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,689
the biggest you know one of the biggest

400
00:16:55,558 --> 00:17:00,118
focus is in Korean natural farming is

401
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:02,608
building the soil foundation that the

402
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:04,110
plant will thrive in but but I also want

403
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:07,169
to make the distinction that Korea

404
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,958
natural farming can also be applied you

405
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:11,970
know foliar Lior into the root zone that

406
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,089
you're in because you've already used

407
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:17,818
the microbes in fermentation then this

408
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:20,398
stuff is now plant available so I can I

409
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:22,470
can take these a lot most the solutions

410
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:24,628
only in fact all of them and put them

411
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,919
into liquid and then spray it on to the

412
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:28,259
plant and because it's already been

413
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,929
fermented by this microbial interphase

414
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,909
then it's directly absorbable into the

415
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:34,889
plant so I don't want people to just

416
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:36,389
think oh well you just have to take the

417
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,278
soil and make the soil good and then

418
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,678
your plant you can actually also

419
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:42,690
directly feed your plant with Korean

420
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:44,370
natural farming which is why I believe

421
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,160
it it makes it really

422
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:49,109
the powerful and adaptable farm system

423
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,450
because we're focused on a soil and

424
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:54,929
direct nutrition through you know

425
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:59,250
through foliar spraying so a lot of us

426
00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:04,110
who dabble in KN F we know that the

427
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:07,558
fermentation process makes the the

428
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:09,479
nutrition bioavailable to the plant but

429
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:12,569
there might be folks like me who don't

430
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,610
actually know why I just know that it

431
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:16,950
does and so I trust in what I'm being

432
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:19,859
taught and I move forward what does the

433
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,980
fermentation process do to the nutrients

434
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:27,269
that make it readily accessible to the

435
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,519
plant well if you I mean you can you can

436
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,410
get into this scientifically and get

437
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,769
some some big terms that you'd need you

438
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:37,769
know a PhD to understand but but in its

439
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:40,079
simplest like and Mallon this things

440
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:42,420
that everyone can understand its the

441
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,039
microbes are essentially digesting it so

442
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,840
so for instance if I'm making a

443
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,599
fermented plant juice or a fish amino

444
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,629
acid I'm putting you know material and

445
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,299
sugar together the osmotic pressure of

446
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:57,030
the sugars drawing out the juices then

447
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,950
those juices are pretty much you can

448
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:01,289
think of it as like an external stomach

449
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,360
because you know the microbes digest

450
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:05,670
externally whereas we digest internally

451
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,699
and they're kind of producing all kinds

452
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:11,700
of enzymes and different things to to

453
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:16,140
break down the whatever material into

454
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,000
the more elemental compounds and in in

455
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,530
making them plant available it's it's

456
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,269
it's like it's just like how when you

457
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:24,210
eat something and you digest it and you

458
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:25,769
get energy it's it's sort of magic but

459
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,450
then you could you could really go into

460
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:30,539
the science and and try to you know

461
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:34,440
really like get a few pages describing

462
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:38,159
how it happened yeah yeah absolutely I

463
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,960
like this idea of an external stomach I

464
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,540
think is what you said it actually I got

465
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:48,029
this envisioning of a of a parent bird

466
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:51,299
pre masticating food before they give it

467
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:54,450
to a baby chick that doesn't really have

468
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:57,668
a fully you develop digestive system yet

469
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,429
it's kind of like we're we're partially

470
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:03,159
digesting it by fermenting it and then

471
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:07,509
giving it to our plant at its optimum

472
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:09,549
usability yeah and I really like that

473
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,348
that an analogy that you're you're the

474
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:13,569
you know a mama bird feeding your baby

475
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:14,858
birds you're doing that pre-digestion to

476
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:17,348
make sure that you're giving the best

477
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:21,308
care to your plans so I like that right

478
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:24,128
not good so so you know wildcrafting for

479
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:26,888
use in KNF preparations is that the

480
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:29,228
basis of why all this works however

481
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:31,718
there are lots of cannabis growers who

482
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:34,209
have never wild crafted like anything at

483
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:35,909
all when they get turned on to KNF it's

484
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:39,028
the first time that they find themselves

485
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:41,829
you know going out into nature to

486
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:45,548
sustainably take from their natural

487
00:20:41,828 --> 00:20:48,489
environment folks who feel a bit awkward

488
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:50,378
and not at home necessarily identifying

489
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:52,899
plants it can be a little off-putting

490
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:55,088
for folks to go off and go off into the

491
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:58,569
woods to to gather whatever they want to

492
00:20:55,088 --> 00:21:00,308
gather at its most basic level some

493
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:03,278
folks like straight up don't pack gloves

494
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:05,678
for harvesting metals for example simply

495
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:08,588
because they've never done it when you

496
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,709
prepare folks to go out and wild craft

497
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:13,479
for their first time what are some of

498
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:16,179
the things that you set them up mentally

499
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:18,069
with so that they can have a you know as

500
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:21,700
much success as possible the first time

501
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:23,378
they go out well well once I mean is

502
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,239
specifically wildcrafting you know

503
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:27,548
talking about fermented plant juices and

504
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:29,409
these different things like so when it

505
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:32,679
when I'm when I'm doing a class with

506
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:34,089
folks usually what we do is on my phone

507
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,489
you know around my farm there's there's

508
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:38,678
all kinds of things growing so what what

509
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:41,588
I'll do with the class is I'll have us

510
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,079
make several different materials all at

511
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:47,138
the same time so for instance making one

512
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:52,328
out of lemongrass one from sweet potato

513
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:55,118
one from comfrey one from you know ripe

514
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:58,239
fruits and when we do all of these

515
00:21:55,118 --> 00:22:00,069
together you get to see this difference

516
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:02,108
that comes out like some plants are

517
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:04,958
super juicy and they yield a bunch

518
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:07,208
really fast others are much slower and

519
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:08,589
so when I'm working with folks to teach

520
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:11,590
them I like to have that diversity

521
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:13,869
because I say well when you go home

522
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:15,788
you know the same same weeds that are

523
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:19,359
growing around your place like on the on

524
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:21,669
you know like just that the the weed

525
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,199
weed plants like they're not weed but

526
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:26,169
like you know weeds things we consider

527
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,569
weeds are usually highly medicinal and

528
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:29,980
so when I what I do during the class is

529
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:32,379
I have them make it from multiple

530
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,778
materials because I say when you go home

531
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,270
you can see the difference here of what

532
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:39,970
happened you you may not get the same

533
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:42,129
results at home like if you used like a

534
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,350
dryer material or something and didn't

535
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,940
in in your and in class it juiced up

536
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:47,589
really well and then you go home and you

537
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,019
try to do it and it doesn't get the same

538
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:51,908
result you may lose confidence and think

539
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:53,740
oh it didn't turn out right but in

540
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:56,559
actuality that plant may have been a

541
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,859
little less juicy so so really what I

542
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,869
like to do in class is is with is you

543
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:04,808
know get as much experience in as much

544
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:06,969
diversity so that we and students there

545
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:09,278
can see and we can hold the jars up and

546
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,490
we can go through and we can smell the

547
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,890
differences in if we're May 1 to day 3

548
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,769
to day 5 or however long the paurav

549
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,778
takes and you get to see these changes

550
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:21,579
so so through my teaching in my

551
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:24,099
preparation for people I just try to get

552
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:26,798
them as many examples as possible and

553
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:29,439
then I try to understand their bio

554
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:32,440
region a bit like for instance Europe

555
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,350
and the Pacific Northwest and a horse

556
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,710
tail like Equus sedum whatever it is

557
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:40,750
it's everywhere

558
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,250
everywhere and in me here in Hawaii I'm

559
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,069
just like sitting there just so jealous

560
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:47,169
because that's all the silica right and

561
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:48,639
that's like in in and you know there's

562
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,169
certain things here bamboo other things

563
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,419
I can get silica out of but but that

564
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:55,090
Equus sedum is just pumped full of it

565
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:57,520
and so really really you know when

566
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:59,470
people it's how to get people into it

567
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,450
it's like you know that same bottle you

568
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,640
were gonna buy at the growth of silica

569
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,308
yeah that's in this weed right here and

570
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,320
you just need a few pounds of sugar and

571
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:09,759
you can get that you know and then

572
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,339
that's the encouragement I give to

573
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,288
people as try to you know with many many

574
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:15,639
people if you're not familiar you look

575
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:16,509
at the ground and you just think it's

576
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,340
green bushes

577
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:20,230
you don't realize oh that's this

578
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:22,509
medicinal herb oh this is this medicinal

579
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,639
herb and your whole medicine closet is

580
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:28,028
just right in your yard

581
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:30,918
you know and it's funny that you would

582
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:32,980
mention you know being jealous about our

583
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,080
horsetail because you know I follow your

584
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,419
fabulous Instagram at natural farming of

585
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,609
Hawaii and I'm always feeling jealous of

586
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:42,710
the fruits that you have got available

587
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:45,319
on your property and you know I think

588
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:48,288
that's kind of a fun thing that you know

589
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,388
natural farmers can are not only

590
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:52,429
intimately aware of what they have

591
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:55,158
locally but also the things that they

592
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:57,710
see other people using and they'd love

593
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,450
to use as well I you know traditionally

594
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,519
when I go on vacation I really like

595
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,278
going to grocery stores in foreign

596
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,710
countries that's one of my things but

597
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:09,190
but I've realized now that right now

598
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,538
when I start to travel I've started

599
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,788
looking for food that's gonna be fun to

600
00:25:11,538 --> 00:25:17,450
snack for sure but now I'm also looking

601
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:19,210
for exotic inputs to bring home and you

602
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,190
know I think that's an interesting

603
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:24,319
characteristic you know of all of us of

604
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,308
the natural farming folk which which

605
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,519
kind of leads me into my next question

606
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:34,089
you know people often ask me can they

607
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:36,500
use grocery store purchased fruits and

608
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:39,798
perhaps vegetables but but well usually

609
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:43,038
people are asking about fruits in their

610
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:47,379
K&amp;F preparations and they say is the

611
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:50,990
more important part the fact that it is

612
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:54,169
ripe and ready and and not reached a

613
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,509
necrotic state yet or is it is the

614
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:59,990
importance that I have taken it directly

615
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:02,538
off the tree and it hasn't gone through

616
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:05,359
you know cleaning and transportation

617
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:10,069
which would wipe the microbes off of the

618
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:13,189
outside of the fruit so getting to the

619
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:17,778
point of the question how usable is

620
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:23,269
store brought fruit for a fruit

621
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:25,960
fermentation yeah so I mean I I mean I

622
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:29,058
know a lot of people have differing

623
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,220
opinions on this and and really the you

624
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:33,888
know that the the ultimate proof in

625
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,569
anything because we can we can you know

626
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:37,969
correct each other and say this is right

627
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:40,369
or that's wrong but the ultimate proof

628
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:42,350
is is in your produce at the end like

629
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:44,779
how chronic are your buds are they

630
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:47,029
frosty are they just are they so chronic

631
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:48,710
that your friends like you know they're

632
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:50,930
like what have I been smoking previous

633
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:53,509
to this you know and that's that's the

634
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,730
ultimate proof but but but to go into

635
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:57,589
that a little bit I I look at the you

636
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,539
know fermented fruit juice recipe and

637
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:01,009
and I know you know here in Hawaii it's

638
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:02,899
it's no big deal like I go you know

639
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:05,750
there's bananas every papayas I'm just

640
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,330
I'm drowning and fruit basically so but

641
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:12,980
but in in in you know winter places

642
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:15,079
where you don't have that access you can

643
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,440
take these fruits and ferment them and

644
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:20,480
get the enzymes primarily what you want

645
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,059
to look at is is what what kind of

646
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,210
biology is doing that reaction in your

647
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:28,220
ferment though you you know in and if

648
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,870
you know cuz I've heard Chris Chris

649
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,490
Trump last time when you interviewed him

650
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:34,009
he talked a little bit about it and he

651
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:36,589
was talking about if the plant is washed

652
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:38,569
and it's and it has these you know the

653
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:41,059
only biology you have is from the hands

654
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:44,839
of the grocery store clerk which is true

655
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:46,819
to a degree but you can you can also you

656
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:50,119
know reenact you late to a degree of

657
00:27:46,819 --> 00:27:53,149
adding in lactic acid bacteria or or

658
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,799
just even a little bit of fresh some

659
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,780
sort of fresh fruit in there like even

660
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,609
if even if you had like you know one

661
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:01,430
wild apple that you picked and you threw

662
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:03,019
that in with your other you know papayas

663
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,660
that you bought for instance and you

664
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:08,240
know um there's there's ways to get

665
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,759
around it so I'm not super dogmatic on

666
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,279
that and when I look at the fermented

667
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:16,940
fruit juice specifically I look at as a

668
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,339
food more than a microbial inoculum so

669
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,009
so where the microbes are important is

670
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:24,559
in that fermentation and are they are

671
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:27,019
they making the enzymes available you

672
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,679
know how are they digesting this this

673
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:32,509
fruit and and that that that's it's hard

674
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:36,289
to say but but a lot of the

675
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:39,230
lactobacillus is in the air so by Nature

676
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:41,149
you know as long as you not get really

677
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,220
funky molds on there you should be

678
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,720
alright but but you know that the

679
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,289
ultimate proof is is at the end of the

680
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,680
day you know in and I I if personally if

681
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:54,589
I was on the mainland or where it was

682
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,080
winter what I would try to do is during

683
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:59,179
fall when when all these wild fruits are

684
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:01,789
coming out like like wild cherries or

685
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,380
you know anything that's that's I just

686
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:04,879
harvest all that all that all the

687
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:09,470
Himalayan black berry and stuff that

688
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,910
makes amazing juice so um you know a lot

689
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,850
of the lot of the folks who are

690
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:16,430
following KNF practices are doing it in

691
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:19,309
their own way in the city you know

692
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:22,100
whether it be in their yard or in a tent

693
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:24,710
or their basement or something and a lot

694
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:27,889
of folks you know they just try to do

695
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:30,460
their best wildcrafting from where they

696
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,590
live and for you know folks in the city

697
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,720
you might be harvesting you know

698
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:37,609
probably illegally from your local park

699
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,190
but you know people take rosehips from

700
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:42,409
the park or or you know their neighbor

701
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,710
might have an overgrown shrub that is

702
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:47,900
showing green tips in the spring and and

703
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,850
a lot of folks don't have a good idea of

704
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,640
where to draw that line and i like that

705
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:55,849
you said on the store-bought fruit that

706
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,700
that you're not necessarily as dogmatic

707
00:29:55,849 --> 00:30:00,679
as some and and and you're you're more

708
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,990
interested in you know the proofs in the

709
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,150
pudding you know so so what do you think

710
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,400
about wildcrafting in the city for

711
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:12,350
people who you know getting outside of

712
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:15,580
the city to wildcraft is is a challenge

713
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:19,490
what kind of hints do you have for for

714
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:22,009
wildcrafting and babylon well so I was

715
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,170
in Los Angeles California right right

716
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:26,240
down on you know Santa Monica Avenue my

717
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:29,390
auntie lives right over there and and

718
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,370
she she's a natural farmer and she was

719
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,350
like you know she was complaining to me

720
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:37,129
she's like I I don't I don't have any

721
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:39,889
other stuff and and I just took her dogs

722
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:43,370
on a walk and I walked downtown and I

723
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,560
saw all kinds of stuff just growing out

724
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:47,869
of the cracks in the in the in the

725
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:50,000
budget rent-a-car parking lot there was

726
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:52,179
enough dandelions growing through the

727
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,250
cracks that I could make an amazing

728
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,930
ferment from those dandelions and you

729
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,599
may you may think to yourself oh well

730
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:02,299
it's kind of its contaminated because

731
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,069
it's in this city and you know car

732
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:05,480
exhaust and all you know the city's not

733
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:08,839
necessarily the most color

734
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,519
a natural place to gather but something

735
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:13,009
like that it's it's not gonna you know

736
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,539
like it's not gonna stop me I'm still

737
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:17,750
gonna ferment that I'm still gonna get

738
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:20,210
an amazing product and from there once I

739
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,250
got my first dandelion fpj then I can

740
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,289
start to grow things in my own yard

741
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,140
maybe maybe spray that on some other

742
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:29,569
things and boost up my own things to

743
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,460
ferment you know but but but literally

744
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:34,129
when every every time I walked out in

745
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,860
the city like la it was just loaded with

746
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,690
things to ferment do you think we need

747
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:42,289
to be resistant to using that stuff

748
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:44,870
because of you know say for example car

749
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:47,058
exhaust you know landing on those plants

750
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:49,189
and be cut you know and being taken up

751
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:51,910
by those plants and then and then we're

752
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,980
spraying those on our plants or is that

753
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:58,600
insignificant enough that it's really

754
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,599
you know not worth being worried about

755
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:05,599
yeah so I would say you know in my in my

756
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:08,029
like say I would I would say it's pretty

757
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,359
insignificant I mean I I but I've never

758
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:14,058
done like chemical testing loads but but

759
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,639
I've always found that the you know like

760
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:18,470
like people think that the the food and

761
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,110
the store is somehow clean or something

762
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,789
but you know like like if it came from a

763
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:24,619
foreign country there's all kinds of

764
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:26,839
emissions and all kinds of stuff all

765
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:29,329
over that so so when you're thinking of

766
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,039
it you think like food from the store is

767
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:34,730
clean but this stuff from the budget

768
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,470
parking lot isn't it it's like to in my

769
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,690
in my opinion you know it's not there's

770
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,919
not that much difference between it you

771
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,890
know and if you're worried about

772
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,480
contamination la B is your friend yeah

773
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,120
yeah la B does kind of clean up

774
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,940
everything that's really true it's funny

775
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:53,298
you know luckily I live on an island

776
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,039
that is quite natural and so there's a

777
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:58,308
lot of things that I can wildcraft

778
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,109
locally but but it so it always cracks

779
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:03,649
me up when you know somebody's pushing

780
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:06,558
me on this or that organic use and then

781
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,679
you know we break for lunch and they go

782
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,240
and they get you know chicken teriyaki

783
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,340
you know on rice and and you know no

784
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,558
part of that is organic or clean and I'm

785
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:17,899
like well you know we're all we're all

786
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:19,279
making our choices on which things we're

787
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,670
going to hold do a high standard and

788
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,309
which things we are not we just want to

789
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,230
but but when it comes to if you know if

790
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:28,250
you're gonna be growing in the city in

791
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:32,150
the first place

792
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:34,700
adding KNF inputs that are local as well

793
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:38,210
they're probably not going to be too far

794
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:40,759
distant yeah well I mean but but don't

795
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,200
but don't like you know the listeners

796
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,599
don't take that to mean like go to some

797
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,740
like nuclear radiation dump and from

798
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:50,419
there within your reason right yeah yeah

799
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,900
totally the same reason we don't want to

800
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:56,029
use you know straw that's been sprayed

801
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,700
or wood chips that you know the city has

802
00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:01,940
sprayed or something's like you know get

803
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:04,160
the best you have available but but also

804
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,590
why don't one of my things I usually

805
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,019
call it rule zero is don't let it stop

806
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:11,269
you from growing if the only thing you

807
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:13,369
have available to you is is some stuff

808
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:15,800
you don't like start fermenting it get

809
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:17,389
la be in there and start growing you

810
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,190
know like don't let it stop you from

811
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,049
growing and say well I can't do this

812
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,380
because everything I get is contaminated

813
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:26,210
I mean just just are you know they the

814
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,039
other the other day I was posting about

815
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,230
gathering seawater and people were like

816
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:32,449
isn't Fukushima leaking in there aren't

817
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:35,148
you gonna get poisoned and I'm like well

818
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:36,949
yeah but I mean aren't we all you know I

819
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:38,599
don't don't let that don't let that stop

820
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:41,000
me I'm not gonna gather seawater just

821
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,710
cuz Fukushima sleeps me in the sea you

822
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,719
know I'm from but I'm here in Hawaii I'm

823
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,760
not gonna gather it right at Fukushima

824
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,129
to use it right you know so that says

825
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,340
these degrees of like you know we live

826
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:53,390
in a contaminated world is the truth I

827
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,269
think that's a great example it's

828
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:58,579
amazing how often I hear people about

829
00:34:55,269 --> 00:35:03,050
resist seawater fermentation because of

830
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:04,730
that or or also FFA right and they're

831
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,070
like oh I wouldn't use anything out of

832
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,420
the ocean I'm like well then you know

833
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,950
it's it's kind of the best we've got at

834
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:14,090
this point with what we've done to the

835
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:17,539
world and being well to use that word

836
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:19,930
again being dogmatic may not serve us in

837
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:23,360
the bigger picture all the time

838
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:26,469
and and and don't don't discount the the

839
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,720
microbes ability to neutralize

840
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:31,159
contaminants like if I gather something

841
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:32,959
and it's in in its

842
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:34,339
has emissions on it like if I gathered

843
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,079
dandelions from a parking lot and they

844
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,809
have emissions on it through the

845
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,670
fermentation process it may be a little

846
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:43,519
bit slower because it's contaminated

847
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,559
but those microbes will to a degree and

848
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,349
I and I'm not sure scientifically but

849
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:51,349
they will neutralize those toxins a bit

850
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:53,929
and so your actual end result after

851
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:56,569
fermentation is actually less toxic than

852
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:57,949
your starting product yeah I got I get

853
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,670
that that makes a lot of sense to me I

854
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:03,319
am you know some of the places that I

855
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,240
help patients garden there on the

856
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,340
they're on the city water on the island

857
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:09,589
you know the downtown water and it's got

858
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,480
chloramine in it right and and regular

859
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:13,700
chlorine you can let it sit out

860
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,769
overnight or mix it a little bit and the

861
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:19,159
chlorine will off gas but chloramine

862
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:21,500
does not off gas and so I recommend

863
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:25,089
folks really just you know fill up a big

864
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:30,289
bucket and then and then put some

865
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:33,950
quality compost into it and let the the

866
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:36,199
natural the humates in the compost will

867
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:38,509
grab that chloramine and neutralize it

868
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:40,969
and I think that there's probably a lot

869
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,400
of that activity going on when we're

870
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:46,489
making these fermentations as well there

871
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,070
are natural protectants in it that a

872
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:51,229
part of their job is going to be to to

873
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:55,370
render these these what we'll call

874
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:57,110
contaminants inert exactly and what you

875
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:59,539
mentioned where you have the humates in

876
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:01,940
the humic and fulvic acids like absorb

877
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:04,489
these things it's the same for folks

878
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,200
growing in salty soil and and these

879
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:08,239
humans and mate they'll they'll grab

880
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:10,489
things and in this this is the same

881
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,859
reason why in natural farming we build

882
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:14,750
soil foundation because what the

883
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,920
microbes are creating in your soil are

884
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,409
these humates

885
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,599
and that's what CLE you know if so say

886
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:22,579
so you have great soil foundation and

887
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,909
now you're watering this chloramine

888
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:27,860
water on it the the humates in your rich

889
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:30,739
good soil foundation are actually

890
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,840
processing those toxins before it gets

891
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:34,579
to your plant so so that's that's

892
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,680
another reason you know that you brought

893
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:38,539
brought that up that that's a bit of

894
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:41,629
Korean natural farming as the soil and

895
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:43,250
the humans humates right on right on so

896
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,820
let's go ahead and take our first short

897
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,469
break and be right back

898
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,750
you're listening to shaping fire and my

899
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:53,250
guest today is natural farming educator

900
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:54,840
Eric Drake Weinert if you listen to

901
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,059
shaping fire and you grow your own

902
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,340
cannabis chances are high that you are

903
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:02,570
very particular about the inputs you use

904
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:05,130
for growing people like us painstakingly

905
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,170
self-educate on cannabis nutrients and

906
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,599
techniques so we can cultivate the

907
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,030
best-tasting and cleanest flowers

908
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,920
possible and when we go to purchase

909
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,440
those nutrients we want to be sure that

910
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,260
our supplier shares our values and is

911
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,349

922
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:53,639
deep to personally vet each product for

923
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,110
quality and determine that there isn't a

924
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:57,960
better version of the product that he

925
00:38:55,110 --> 00:39:00,390
could be selling because of this arduous

00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,349
all gas glue and classic Sour Diesel

963

heritage California strains like OG Kush

965
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,459
Jack hair and headband and their

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,170
award-winning blueberry muffin is one

967
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:43,679

Humboldt seed company is proud to bring

970
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,010
to market the infamous freakshow

971
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:53,709
cultivar - which has a great THC high

972
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:55,840
but looks so much like a fern that some

973
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,550
folks can't even identify it as cannabis

974
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,750
it's a plant that really needs to be

975
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,780
seen to be believed

976
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:04,210
if you're looking for well-balanced CBD

977
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,940
seeds Humboldt seed company can turn you

978
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:09,880
on to CBD strains that actually have

979
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:13,090
flavor like the dill and pepper terpenes

980
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,880
of Willy G's Lebanese landrace whether

plant Humboldt seed company let them

993
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:47,980
know Shango sent yet one of the reasons

994
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,809
why no-till cannabis growing is so

995
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,730
valued by farmers is because the

996
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:54,279
mycelium networks in the soil remain

997
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,260
established from year to year and we

998
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,180
know these fungal networks are essential

999
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,190
because they are the nutrient super

1000
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:01,719
highways that extend far and wide in the

1001
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:04,510
substrate to feed your plants

1002
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:06,669
the trouble with growing in new soils or

1003
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:08,740
blended cocoa substrates is that it

1004
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,559
takes most of the plant's life just to

1005
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:13,568
create these mycelium highways

1006
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,180
I know Michael endo mycorrhizal fungi

1007
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:18,159
inoculant reduces that time and gets

1008
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:21,009
your plant eating a wider array of

1009
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,868
nutrients faster and it's three times

1010
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:24,759
the concentration of the current leading

1011
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:27,099
brand in the u.s. at nine hundred

1012

1013
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:31,749
species selected specifically for

1014
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:34,088
cannabis cultivation this new product

1015
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:35,679
called Dyna Mico is the result of 30

1016
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:37,929
years of research and trials at the

1017
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,058
volcano a Greek ultra Research Institute

1018
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:42,308
in Israel it has also been vigorously

1019
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:44,349
trialed by cannabis and food growers

1020
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,660
across the US since the product first

1021
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:48,579
arrived here last year you may have

1022
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:52,239
already even heard about dynamite go by

1023
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:54,489
its original name dynamite now Dino myko

1024
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,528
is available at grow shops and online in

1025
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:59,349
the United States for the first time I

1026
00:42:56,528 --> 00:43:01,059
love using dynamite go to both speed up

1027
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:03,849
the growth of mycelium networks in the

1028
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:06,189
soil but also as a bio stimulant to make

1029
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:08,229
clone cuttings more virile you can see

1030
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:10,868
side by sides showing the comparative

1031
00:43:08,228 --> 00:43:14,078
growth on their Instagram at Dino Mico

1032
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:15,729
if you demand reliable growing results

1033
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,499
and appreciate the importance of an

1034
00:43:15,728 --> 00:43:19,958
active root zone in creating a thriving

1035

1045
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:49,838
host Shango Llosa our guest this week is

1046
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,858
natural farming educator Eric Drake

1047
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:55,568
Weinert so Drake let's talk about

1048
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:59,380
collecting indigenous micro organisms

1049
00:43:55,568 --> 00:44:02,528
for a moment for indoor growers you know

1050
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:05,199
the information on why to use IMO and

1051
00:44:02,528 --> 00:44:07,179
how to do it outdoors that information

1052
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,219
is pretty well available but but one of

1053
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:12,099
the questions I always get from basement

1054
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:14,650
or tent growers is should they be

1055
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:17,699
collecting the microbes literally in

1056
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:21,160
their basement with in the rice box or

1057
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:24,880
should they still go out into nature and

1058
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:27,879
collect the outdoor microbes

1059
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,030
and bring them back to their tent in the

1060
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:35,800
hopes of kind of infusing the tent with

1061
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:38,590
more life that I mean that's a that's a

1062
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:44,080
good question on this and and the whole

1063
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:45,850
key for the IML process is diversity so

1064
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,230
so one of the reasons you're going out

1065
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:51,730
to a forest to go grab it is that in you

1066
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,710
know you know forest there's a lot of

1067
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:56,710
diversity it's usually a poly culture

1068
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,900
there's a lot of detritus kind of

1069
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,329
decaying on the ground which is a great

1070
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:04,690
rich food source which encourages a lot

1071
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:07,599
of fungal diversity and some old-growth

1072
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:10,900
forests have microbes that are just ages

1073
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,509
and ages old like like like one one one

1074
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:19,570
interesting fact is that or like not

1075
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:22,780
fact but idea is that as a as a 1-week

1076
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:25,300
of my time like like you know for me one

1077
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,850
week occurred in if you scale that down

1078
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,860
to the microbes and their size it's one

1079
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:33,309
week for them is about ten-thousand

1080
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:35,200
years and so so if you think of one week

1081
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:37,090
of elapsed it's like oh well a few

1082
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,799
things changed for the microbes ten

1083
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:41,650
thousand years have changed multi

1084
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,800
generations all these things and so when

1085
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:46,300
you go grab the microbes from the forest

1086
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,760
they've been going through this for

1087
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,789
thousands and thousands of years like

1088
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,320
like it you know equivalent and so going

1089
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:55,659
out to a forest and getting these

1090
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:58,360
microbes brings in these strong fungal

1091
00:45:55,659 --> 00:46:00,429
microbes so I believe if you're in a if

1092
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,550
you're in an indoor situation or you're

1093
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:05,769
indoors I think that going out to a to

1094
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:08,800
an intact growing forest is very

1095
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:11,170
beneficial to bring this diversity that

1096
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,460
if you think of your indoor area you

1097
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,680
know usually you're cleaning at each

1098
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,289
time and so you're you're resetting your

1099
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:19,269
microbes back to like brand-new right

1100
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:21,369
each time you're cleaning things and

1101
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:24,730
you're not getting this generational

1102
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:27,609
knowledge that's out in the forest but I

1103
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:30,849
also bring that to that you should

1104
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:34,420
probably do multiple collections some

1105
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:38,889
one of those being a really nice fungal

1106
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:42,820
e rich forest area around you one being

1107
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:44,440
right right in your very localized area

1108
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,120
like within a hundred feet of where

1109
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,760
you're growing that's the richest area

1110
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:51,639
you can find and then if you're indoors

1111
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,990
one right indoors or or if you're

1112
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:55,449
outdoors it'd be right in the field

1113
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:57,369
where you're growing so so by taking

1114
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:59,409
these these three collections which

1115
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:01,269
which don't limit yourself to just three

1116
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:03,190
you could you could do more than this

1117
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:05,889
but with these three collections you're

1118
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:07,300
getting the the granddaddy educators

1119
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:10,480
from the forest

1120
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:13,150
you're then getting the best guys from

1121
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,920
your nearby vicinity and then you're

1122
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:18,280
getting the third collection which is

1123
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:20,170
your right in your growing area so

1124
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,500
whatever is adapted there that's that's

1125
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:25,360
the best and then by taking those those

1126
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,199
collections from those three areas you

1127
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,539
can then combine them later into like it

1128
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,069
when you're activating IMO like an IMO

1129
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:35,199
three process where you're making a book

1130
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,510
coffee out of it you can combine those

1131
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,909
in there and the best of all those

1132
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,920
worlds will harmonize and reproduce with

1133
00:47:39,909 --> 00:47:44,199
each other and come out with even more

1134
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,440
diversity that's tuned even more to your

1135
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:49,299
region so you can also take those and

1136
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,269
make them into a compost tea if you're

1137
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:56,380
gonna go liquid route so so so by having

1138
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:58,420
multiple IMO collections of those areas

1139
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:01,329
you're gonna get the best of all worlds

1140
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,579
happening I love that idea and and I

1141
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:05,619
also love that it did not occur to me to

1142
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:08,159
do multiples and then and then mix them

1143
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:11,380
up I think that I would really enjoy

1144
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:13,750
doing those three collections and then

1145
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:19,269
putting those three collections together

1146
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:22,539
at the same time on a on a microscope

1147
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:25,150
slide and watching them to see who

1148
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:27,489
outcompetes whom certainly it would

1149
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,990
happen differently in the soil but gosh

1150
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:31,359
it would be really interesting to take

1151
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:34,569
these you know these these you know

1152
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:36,820
old-growth forests yoda microbes and

1153
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:40,780
introduce them to some like you know

1154
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:42,519
city Tufts in microbes and then with

1155
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,240
whatever the hell is in the basement you

1156
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,949
know just to see see how they interact

1157
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:49,299
that'll be cool yeah yeah and I think

1158
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:50,949
you're gonna get the best of all worlds

1159
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,359
and so you're gonna get us like those

1160
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:53,558
when those microbes Bri

1161
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:56,949
with each other you're gonna get things

1162
00:48:53,559 --> 00:49:00,278
that you couldn't otherwise have so when

1163
00:48:56,949 --> 00:49:02,009
when collecting IMO properly outside you

1164
00:49:00,278 --> 00:49:07,048
know sometimes I'll see these like

1165
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:09,219
gorgeous white uniform you know fuzzy

1166
00:49:07,048 --> 00:49:10,748
collections and I'm like oh they really

1167
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:12,639
did it right that's that's that's a

1168
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:15,929
beautiful thing and then and then

1169
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:19,328
sometimes I see some color splotches and

1170
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:22,028
and then sometimes I see different color

1171
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:23,619
splotches and those are bad but the

1172
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:27,818
first color splotches they're like oh

1173
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:30,160
that's just microbe variety so so what

1174
00:49:27,818 --> 00:49:34,960
is the benchmark or is there a benchmark

1175
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:37,509
or a thumb approach thumbnail approach

1176
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,970
to knowing like like when it's when it's

1177
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:41,858
solid white and it looks fluffy and

1178
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:44,558
beautiful we generally know that we did

1179
00:49:41,858 --> 00:49:49,268
it right but how do we know if our

1180
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:51,910
colored splotches on it are probiotic

1181
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:55,479
splotches or are actually contaminant

1182
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:57,399
splotches but that's that's a good

1183
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,789
question on that in terms of like what

1184
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,680
what what makes a good collection the

1185
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:05,200
the interesting thing of this is that

1186
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:06,998
when you're when you know when you get

1187
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,980
that great collection you're saying and

1188
00:50:06,998 --> 00:50:11,199
you see although the white like

1189
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,028
spiderweb it looks like almost cotton

1190
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:16,449
balls kind of like it's that it's that

1191
00:50:13,028 --> 00:50:18,518
thick and like what you're seeing there

1192
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:21,578
those microbes that you're actually

1193
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:24,338
visually seeing are not actually the

1194
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:25,809
microbes you want per se like like

1195
00:50:24,338 --> 00:50:27,699
they're just they're they're mostly I

1196
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:29,319
don't know the exact genus but there's

1197
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:32,409
about three different varieties like

1198
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,940
bacillus subtilis and something else

1199
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:37,298
there's these three microbes that are

1200
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,349
the predominant ones but those even

1201
00:50:37,298 --> 00:50:40,119
though you see them those aren't really

1202
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:41,829
what you want but it indicates that you

1203
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,230
have a good collection because when

1204
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:46,660
those are thriving and they're growing

1205
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:49,358
it means their partners the ones that

1206
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:51,068
are smaller the diverse soil microbes

1207
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:54,699
that you've collected into your starch

1208
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:56,558
source are the ones that you want so so

1209
00:50:54,699 --> 00:50:58,808
it's like if you see the white though

1210
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,720
the white fuzz growing it means that the

1211
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:03,940
other microbes that are in tandem with

1212
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:06,239
it are in in this symbiosis in the same

1213
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:09,309
collection are the ones you want

1214
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,538
so so it's it the thing about IMO

1215
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:13,359
collection is you're collecting these

1216
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:15,220
very subtle things that microbes that we

1217
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,170
don't know that much about them we know

1218
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:18,879
a lot about those three or four Genesis

1219
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:20,889
but we don't know about these with these

1220
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,970
soil microbes there it's largely a

1221
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:27,159
mystery to all known science Wow and so

1222
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:29,618
so so so what so when you see that white

1223
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,778
stuff you know like in its in its it you

1224
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:33,160
can't even like DNA sequence it really

1225
00:51:31,778 --> 00:51:36,608
to say well we found this and that

1226
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:38,500
because the the three the big three will

1227
00:51:36,608 --> 00:51:40,838
be there but the subtlety and the

1228
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:45,429
diversity in those smaller ones in those

1229
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:47,108
the lesser ones are are unknown to us so

1230
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:49,239
the white fuzz is kind of an indicator

1231
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:51,429
species it's like hey if you've got the

1232
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,709
white fuzz what you're actually trying

1233
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:55,899
to collect is probably here and if

1234
00:51:53,710 --> 00:52:00,039
you're not getting any white fuzz since

1235
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:01,838
they are partners with our actual target

1236
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,240
microbes if you're not collecting white

1237
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,608
fuzz you're probably not getting the

1238
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:08,649
target stuff as well I like that and

1239
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:09,548
actually I didn't understand that so so

1240
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:17,410
how so

1241
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:19,719
what would you do a- splosh like if you

1242
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:21,308
if you were talking to a new student and

1243
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,959
they said ah I've got these splotches

1244
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:26,319
how would you help him think through

1245
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,349
whether or not the the contaminants or

1246
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:31,210
the splotches are are good and it's it's

1247
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:32,859
yet another indicator that there's an

1248
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,630
active microbe life or you're like oh no

1249
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:38,409
that's gone bad you got to throw that

1250
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:40,269
away well well so so really the other

1251
00:52:38,409 --> 00:52:42,278
splotches and other things tend to be

1252
00:52:40,268 --> 00:52:44,318
like the other color things like

1253
00:52:42,278 --> 00:52:47,048
begetting greens and yellows and these

1254
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:49,239
even reds but red red you don't want

1255
00:52:47,048 --> 00:52:51,759
read it red is the one color like if

1256
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:53,889
it's red you don't want it that I throw

1257
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:55,778
it away like don't you know the even

1258
00:52:53,889 --> 00:53:00,818
compost put it in your neighbors compost

1259
00:52:55,778 --> 00:53:02,889
okay like like but but those other other

1260
00:53:00,818 --> 00:53:05,500
splotches they're largely to do with

1261
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:08,828
moisture content and this is that this

1262
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,539
is where it becomes super tricky and you

1263
00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:12,700
gotta cut and I know your area know the

1264
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:14,890
climate and just do a few collections to

1265
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:16,449
really get a good one but it's it's it's

1266
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:17,288
whether your substrate is too wet or too

1267
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:19,259
dry

1268
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:21,600
why don't one of the main May

1269
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,580
problems I find is that people will cook

1270
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,380
their rice and they'll put it in the box

1271
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:27,380
and it's still hot and then they'll

1272
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,930
cover it and what happens is the the

1273
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,550
rice still steam comes off it goes to

1274
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:34,199
the lid whatever kind of lid you put on

1275
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:36,180
there paper towel whatever it forms

1276
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:38,730
droplets and it drips down and

1277
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:40,649
everywhere a water drip hits your rice

1278
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:43,050
that's where you'll get a green splotch

1279
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:45,030
or like a yellow splotch and what that

1280
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:49,830
is is too much water in that area and it

1281
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:51,600
became anaerobic and and so so but what

1282
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:54,179
I what I tell people with that is is

1283
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:57,539
that really what it comes down to is

1284
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:59,549
it's an 8020 rule meaning that that if

1285
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:02,070
you go and you get a hundred percent

1286
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:04,800
like white awesome collection I've done

1287
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:06,840
that maybe like four or five six times

1288
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,750
in my life and I've probably collected

1289
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,519
you know 100 200 of these things so it's

1290
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,380
not like even even I'm not getting the

1291
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,380
white every time really what I'm getting

1292
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:19,349
is what I call the 8020 rule where if I

1293
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:23,099
look at it 80% of the the rice looks

1294
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:24,599
nice and white and kind of mice you know

1295
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:27,089
that the cotton candy coming and then

1296
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:29,519
there's 20% of it is is different color

1297
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:32,120
that's a good collection because I'm

1298
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,530
actually those anaerobes are to a degree

1299
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:37,889
part of this you know the the whole

1300
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:40,530
picture and and it's about keeping them

1301
00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:42,690
in balance and when I go to propagate

1302
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,360
them further it's not like if I got an

1303
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,550
80 like an 80 percent good collection

1304
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,230
then when I grow it out I'm gonna grow

1305
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,360
that 20 percent you know that that

1306
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:54,240
contamination is gonna take over my pile

1307
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,430
it's not the case usually the good ones

1308
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:59,339
the beneficial ones under ideal

1309
00:54:56,429 --> 00:55:02,099
conditions will dominate in in later

1310
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:04,500
propagation stages of IMO they'll

1311
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:07,170
eliminate those those green guys are the

1312
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:10,500
ones that I don't need you know as

1313
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:12,780
conditions permit yes so yeah that makes

1314
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,670
sense yeah I'm good yeah so so even

1315
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,650
without the world's best collection it's

1316
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:19,470
not it's it's not the end of the world

1317
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:21,480
it's it's it's really really the the

1318
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:24,209
collections I would say are no good our

1319
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:28,740
ones that when you like pick it up and

1320
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:30,420
it's soggy like like really it like when

1321
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:32,649
I have really good collections I can

1322
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,750
take the rice out of the box and

1323
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:37,599
hold it from one corner and like shake

1324
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:39,548
it and it stays together cuz it's

1325
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,289
completely my ciliated out and the

1326
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:44,409
fungal things are just holding it

1327
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:48,220
together so tightly that it's it's like

1328
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:50,679
a like um what do they call it natto

1329
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:52,929
yeah japanese you know when you cut that

1330
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:54,009
open it's like a paste it's like a brick

1331
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:56,980
right yeah totally

1332
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:59,109
it's that type of activity that you want

1333
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:04,240
you want that brick kind of stuff if you

1334
00:55:59,108 --> 00:56:06,038
ever get mush mushy soggy that's not the

1335
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:11,229
those are the collections that you don't

1336
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:15,250
want so so let's shift a little bit from

1337
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:17,019
IMO back over to liquid preparations

1338
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:20,318
because I want to talk a little bit

1339
00:56:17,019 --> 00:56:22,239
about about storing because I can't

1340
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:25,389
believe I'm the only one who's made a

1341
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:27,818
can F ferment in preparation and then

1342
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:30,608
have it go bad what I feel is

1343
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:33,099
prematurely and I and you know sometimes

1344
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:35,170
we want a permeable lid and sometimes we

1345
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:37,930
want a sealed lid and sometimes we want

1346
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:40,900
it in the fridge but sometimes we really

1347
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:43,269
just want it in a cool dark place walk

1348
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:46,108
us through how to think about storage of

1349
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:49,568
these essentially living preparations

1350
00:56:46,108 --> 00:56:51,308
umm what okay yeah storage storage is a

1351
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:53,079
great consideration I mean I know you

1352
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:55,650
talked about it last time with Chris a

1353
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:59,579
bit but when when you're done making a

1354
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:02,619
ferment like a fermented plant juice I

1355
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:04,839
what I in in it's so similar with the

1356
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:08,588
IMO it's there's a concept called

1357
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:11,199
super saturation and and and what what

1358
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:15,159
it what I mean in this context is that

1359
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:20,649
what happens is every water molecule is

1360
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:22,480
bound with a sugar molecule in in this

1361
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:24,400
in this form and actually sugar holds a

1362
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,838
whole bunch of water around it it's it's

1363
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,900
really thirsty in the way it that

1364
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:31,929
chemically holds water and so what what

1365
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:34,389
happens into in preservation and natural

1366
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:37,328
farming if you're having stuff go bad

1367
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:41,920
it's usually that you didn't add enough

1368
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:44,318
sugar to to balance out all the water so

1369
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,480
so like the classic adage that water is

1370
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:49,029
life if there is a vey

1371
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,909
water in my solution that's not bound

1372
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:53,800
with a sugar life we'll find that and it

1373
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:55,869
will eat the water and as it eats that

1374
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,940
water it'll degrade my product further

1375
00:57:55,869 --> 00:58:00,609
which will eventually cause cause

1376
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,960
spoilage but if I'm able to add enough

1377
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:05,079
sugar in there just similar though

1378
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,360
making it a jelly or a jam preserve

1379
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:10,690
where they add so much sugar that then

1380
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:13,660
it preserves it this is the same concept

1381
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:17,860
and in what I like to draw for folks is

1382
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:20,980
it's like Han Solo in carbonite so so

1383
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:23,170
literally like Han Solo is is frozen in

1384
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,909
carbonite he's just frozen there right

1385
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,440
and but but when then when Luke comes in

1386
00:58:24,909 --> 00:58:28,299
defrost them you know that the force

1387
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,059
reawakens that you know he comes back

1388
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,250
right right in it's this similar concept

1389
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:37,119
that by adding sugar into your solution

1390
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:39,400
and sugar is carbon you're essentially

1391
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,559
putting Carbonite in freezing all the

1392
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,300
microbes in these things that later when

1393
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:45,219
you dilute them with water that could

1394
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,260
that that carbon the sugar becomes a

1395
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:49,149
food source the carbons dissolved enough

1396
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:51,580
that you're freed from this prison and

1397
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:53,530
now they could they're the nutrients

1398
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:56,110
haven't been degraded in this process so

1399
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,910
so it's really about super saturating

1400
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:59,680
with enough sugar and you got to just

1401
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,480
add sugar until you see it settle out

1402
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,549
and I have I have some good videos on

1403
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,710
that about how you know it's it's a

1404
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:07,600
visually see because once you see it in

1405
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,490
your nose supersaturation it's like okay

1406
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,019
I know how to preserve anything now yeah

1407
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:12,549
once once you've seen it done you're

1408
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:17,559
like oh I understand this is like a

1409
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:19,930
whole plugin for my brain I'm sorry I'm

1410
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:22,630
so so you know a lot of folks like to

1411
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:26,169
show off their confidence in their

1412
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:27,430
ferments by drinking them and and a heck

1413
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:29,710
some people just do it straight up with

1414
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:32,529
nutrients generally but but many folks

1415
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:35,320
don't seem ready to really use their

1416
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:37,780
preparations internally well especially

1417
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:41,470
in these days of the corona virus

1418
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:44,980
pandemic will Oh H n help strengthen the

1419
00:59:41,469 --> 00:59:47,199
human immune systems is it is it

1420
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:51,579
beneficial to drink for example like

1421
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:54,519
labs and how what standard would you use

1422
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:58,599
for newbies trying to figure out if

1423
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:59,469
their stuff is successful enough to go

1424
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:03,130
ahead and

1425
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:05,199
drink internally well well first I just

1426
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:07,450
preface by say I'm not a doctor it's not

1427
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,939
Melek advice or anything but but just

1428
01:00:07,449 --> 01:00:12,189
based on my my practice and my things

1429
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,480
that I've experimented and and things

1430
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:18,150
I've heard from other people that have

1431
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:20,440
tried number one is smell it

1432
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:23,740
don't don't don't just put it in your

1433
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:25,510
mouth smell it if if it smells okay like

1434
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:28,149
like it shouldn't smell like rotting

1435
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:30,490
eggs vomit death or poop if it smells

1436
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:33,460
those four smells don't put it in your

1437
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:35,889
mouth and just say it's I don't know

1438
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:37,780
it's you know just don't don't don't use

1439
01:00:35,889 --> 01:00:40,900
that one internally but if it doesn't

1440
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:44,200
have those smells then you then tasting

1441
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:47,920
you know I I drink fermented plant juice

1442
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:49,750
the food can of food all the time I I

1443
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,940
make it from all kinds of different

1444
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:54,639
things and that's and what I do is I add

1445
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:56,769
it to my water to flavor it so I'll just

1446
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:59,650
you know in it's essentially it's like

1447
01:00:56,769 --> 01:01:01,780
an old old soda recipe that's what soda

1448
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:04,059
used to be was these extracts and sugar

1449
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,740
and and that's you know people used to

1450
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:08,679
make all these different syrups from

1451
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:12,639
these things and so so I'll use it to

1452
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:16,779
drink it's great and energizing and then

1453
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:19,900
when I get into LA B usually I find that

1454
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,470
it's so I got a I got a story that I

1455
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,349
made it

1456
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:25,449
leader like a quart jar I think that a

1457
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:27,338
leader what are a leader jar of this

1458
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:29,949
stuff and I gave it to my friend to for

1459
01:01:27,338 --> 01:01:33,880
a month's supply to try and he drank the

1460
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:35,858
entire jar in one day oh wow so he drank

1461
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,240
a month's supply plus all that sugar and

1462
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:40,809
I was like how do you feel he's like oh

1463
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:43,179
you know but but he drank this and he

1464
01:01:40,809 --> 01:01:46,179
was fine so so I don't believe that you

1465
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:49,210
can overdose on la be the the problem is

1466
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:51,960
if you take too much la be is the LA Bay

1467
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:54,338
will eat the food of your indigenous

1468
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,349
microorganisms and they're really

1469
01:01:54,338 --> 01:01:58,750
powerful so let's just wrestle away the

1470
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:59,920
food from your indigenous microbes so if

1471
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:02,380
you're looking to build a lot of

1472
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,230
indigenous gut by otta or indigenous

1473
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:08,440
microbes everywhere you gotta use la be

1474
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:11,679
in balance but for human consumption my

1475
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,059
own consumption I've seen you my friend

1476
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:15,309
didn't overdose and I've

1477
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:19,539
I just add it a little bit you know and

1478
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:22,299
it's and in a healthy person la B should

1479
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:24,550
be about 30 percent of your microbes so

1480
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:26,590
if you're always adding this la B in

1481
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:29,470
you're going to boost your immune system

1482
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:31,260
just based on that that la B helps all

1483
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:34,119
the other indigenous microbes in a way

1484
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:35,140
and then and then for your go-ahead no I

1485
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:37,179
didn't I thought you were done go ahead

1486
01:02:35,139 --> 01:02:39,039
please finish oh oh and then and then to

1487
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:42,309
go in to go until the last the last bit

1488
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,800
about the Oh H n is that the the cool

1489
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:46,659
thing about that is that it's all these

1490
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,480
different herbs and they've just been

1491
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:51,190
fermented and then tinctured and so the

1492
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,179
nice thing is that unlike other

1493
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:57,280
medicines like like you you can't you

1494
01:02:55,179 --> 01:02:59,889
can take it regularly and it basically

1495
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,630
just boosts your immune system up so

1496
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:04,000
imagine your immune system just going up

1497
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:05,829
a level and then it does it but it's not

1498
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,230
like a peak that it's gonna fall from it

1499
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:11,980
just raises it up that it'll stay there

1500
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:14,429
and with regular juice it's just all

1501
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:17,170
those things help you digest better and

1502
01:03:14,429 --> 01:03:18,819
you know they're they're proven anti

1503
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:21,610
pathogens you know garlic yeah

1504
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:24,130
supercharged halogens yeah exactly

1505
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:27,400
yes so when you were explaining that I

1506
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:31,180
actually got this corny idea in my head

1507
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:34,269
that you know if we spray beneficial

1508
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:36,669
microbes on the outside of the plant so

1509
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:39,099
that beneficial microbes take up

1510
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:41,170
residence on the tops and the bottom of

1511
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:44,619
our leaves which makes it a less

1512
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:46,930
hospitable environment for say for

1513
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:48,759
example powdery mildew to come and land

1514
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:50,289
on a leaf they can't really do it as

1515
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:54,460
much because it's already populated

1516
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:55,869
heavily by beneficial microbes it makes

1517
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:58,869
it occur to me that maybe I should be

1518
01:03:55,869 --> 01:04:01,690
doing lab foliar on myself in these days

1519
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:04,179
of coronavirus so that you know that's

1520
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:05,889
less possible that I touch anything or

1521
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:08,469
anything gets on me that that eventually

1522
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:10,719
finds its way into you know my eyes or

1523
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:13,989
my mouth now now seriously you know

1524
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:15,939
again we are not doctors but you know if

1525
01:04:13,989 --> 01:04:17,739
we're talking about natural systems and

1526
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:20,409
if my body is already covered in

1527
01:04:17,739 --> 01:04:23,189
microorganisms I would think that the

1528
01:04:20,409 --> 01:04:25,108
more supercharged my skin is

1529
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:27,420
if lactobacillus acid and other

1530
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:30,088
potential beneficial microbes that I

1531
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:33,030
become less of an environment for for

1532
01:04:30,088 --> 01:04:35,759
pests if you will well this is

1533
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:38,630
absolutely true that so so I actually

1534
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:42,180
use lactic acid bacteria in my laundry

1535
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:44,789
so so not only so you know each time I

1536
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:46,318
do laundry I just pour in about Alice or

1537
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:49,108
so I don't I'm just pre pour it in there

1538
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:51,119
just to just to inoculate it so it helps

1539
01:04:49,108 --> 01:04:53,279
to clean your your clothes and then and

1540
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:55,740
then when I'm putting that on I'm

1541
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,230
getting this microbial armor in my

1542
01:04:55,739 --> 01:05:00,149
clothes and you know if I ever sweat or

1543
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:02,519
anything those microbes will eat it up

1544
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:04,650
so I don't I don't stink at all and and

1545
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:06,630
I think of it as um you know yeah it's

1546
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,910
it's it's so my clothes are washed in it

1547
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:10,410
and then yesterday since you know since

1548
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:12,059
coronavirus is hot right now I don't

1549
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:14,190
really want to like play too much into

1550
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:16,078
that but but yesterday when I went out

1551
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,909
to the hardware store I and I actually

1552
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,500
went to Costco as well which is like a

1553
01:05:17,909 --> 01:05:22,529
you know this is one place you're gonna

1554
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:25,769
get infections there's a petri dish yeah

1555
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:28,800
right so when I got home I immediately

1556
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:31,318
took you know a bowl filled it with

1557
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:33,599
water poured in a you know a little bit

1558
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:35,329
of lacto got it and it started up and

1559
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,890
just just rubbed it all over my body

1560
01:05:35,329 --> 01:05:39,869
every like like my whole face my arms

1561
01:05:37,889 --> 01:05:42,838
everywhere that was exposed I just

1562
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:46,050
rubbed it on just so any any pathogen I

1563
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:49,650
picked up on that expedition I come home

1564
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:54,869
in the LA be is I what I translated la

1565
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:56,670
be into is KNF police so any pathogen

1566
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:59,099
that's like a thug or a gangster that's

1567
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:00,838
gonna cause trouble to me it's like I'm

1568
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:03,059
just putting the police all over myself

1569
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:04,980
and so they're just gonna go and and

1570
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:07,139
think think of like non corrupt police

1571
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:08,519
cuz they're well fed okay you know I

1572
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:11,129
mean sometimes I think police we think

1573
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:13,440
oh God totally like police allies got it

1574
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:15,510
yeah yeah yeah but imagine beneficial

1575
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,940
police okay like like just imagine this

1576
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:20,190
ideal world out there right and and I

1577
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:23,130
put so I put all these microbes which

1578
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:26,190
act as police officers all over me so

1579
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:29,460
any any thug was was was processed so I

1580
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:32,159
felt like that that was my kind of

1581
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,900
biosecurity to come like how am I gonna

1582
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:36,509
come back into my home and not bring

1583
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:39,510
this pathogen with me if I was exposed

1584
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:42,150
well I just treat it with a beneficial

1585
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:44,280
microbe that will eat the food of that

1586
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:46,829
one and or eliminate that one from the

1587
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,720
system Wow

1588
01:06:46,829 --> 01:06:50,579
I love that idea and it totally makes me

1589
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:53,000
want to take some of my labs and put

1590
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:55,739
them in a spray bottle and you know

1591
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,710
spray them on myself to finish a shower

1592
01:06:55,739 --> 01:07:01,108
or something or you know cuz you know I

1593
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:03,119
I live in Washington right and and we

1594
01:07:01,108 --> 01:07:05,309
are the epicenter of coronavirus and and

1595
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,410
you know my whole island is locked down

1596
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:09,119
the churches are closed the schools are

1597
01:07:07,409 --> 01:07:10,529
closed it's pretty much even though I

1598
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,130
don't want to like play into the fear

1599
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:16,320
aspect it's a constant daily reminder

1600
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:19,380
you know I mean I'm essentially on

1601
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:22,289
voluntary isolation at home just because

1602
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:26,190
I don't want to be a vector or get sick

1603
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:29,309
myself and and it'd be interesting to to

1604
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:32,490
add to that with giving myself foliar

1605
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:35,219
and adding this layer of you know body

1606
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:37,979
protectant to my to my outside and you

1607
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:40,199
know even though it's new to me I bet

1608
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:43,500
you you know back to the land folks have

1609
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:45,299
been doing this for a long-ass time yeah

1610
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,760
that I mean like lactobacillus is

1611
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:50,039
actually proven in meat processing

1612
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,380
facilities to be a better cleanser to

1613
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:55,829
get rid of pathogens than bleach well in

1614
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:59,400
in in long-term so so you mentioned that

1615
01:07:55,829 --> 01:08:00,840
in you know um so we my family we had a

1616
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,960
meeting last night we discussed

1617
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:06,690
biosecurity and and part of that is you

1618
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,760
know every every day or at least once a

1619
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:11,849
week I'm going around the property and

1620
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:15,180
it's spraying blacked it's just for my

1621
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:17,699
plants but that's creating a safe zone

1622
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:19,349
around here where even if neighbors were

1623
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:20,818
contaminated that stuff you know if that

1624
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,560
microbe floats through there and lands

1625
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:25,830
it's it's gonna be processed by this

1626
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,539
lab2 that's totally cool I'm really glad

1627
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:30,449
that they came up even though I wasn't

controlled environment of indoor

1699
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:11,710
greenhouses can be the best of both

1700
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:13,810
worlds for many greenhouse operators

1701
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:15,880
though building their greenhouse before

1702
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:17,830
gaining insight into how cannabis

1703
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:20,199
greenhouses differ from ornamental crops

1704
01:11:17,829 --> 01:11:23,229
can be the start of a world of hurt

design build and equip their greenhouses

for over a decade first starting in

1718
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:53,650
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses

1719
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:55,569
and how to overcome them in episode

1720
01:11:53,649 --> 01:11:58,479
number forty one of the shaping fire

1721
01:11:55,569 --> 01:12:00,609
podcast no matter where I go in the

1722
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:02,439
country good people with smart

1723
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:05,049
backgrounds still are making the mistake

1724
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:07,178
of building without knowing cannabis and

1725
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:09,850
it causes them to burn through capital

1726
01:12:07,179 --> 01:12:12,310
and time fast everyone has their own

1727
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:14,320
failure point for some it is improper

1728
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:16,060
ventilation planning for others it is

1729
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,759
surface temperatures of the building or

1730
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:20,140
the plants leaves or both some folks

1731
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,329
that build their greenhouse from scratch

1732
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:24,039
make really basic errors like placement

1733
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:25,510
of the greenhouse on the property or not

1734
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:27,219
understanding the natural environment

1735
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:29,440
where the greenhouse sits

1736
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:31,600
some have even built a decent greenhouse

1737
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:33,158
but are inefficient in their deployment

1738
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,400
of light deprivation techniques and

1739
01:12:33,158 --> 01:12:37,750
never really hit their target yields

1740
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:39,549
it's great when you learn from your

1741
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,770
mistakes but it's even better when you

1742
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:43,960
learn from the mistakes of others when

1743
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:45,610
you bring on greenhouse advisory group

1744
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,500
you will learn from the mistakes of

1745
01:12:45,609 --> 01:12:49,119
their many clients and you'll take

1746
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:51,310
advantage of the best practices

1747
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:53,140
developed by Erik Branstad over his

1748
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:56,050
years of working with clients just like

1749
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:58,030
you from location development to

1750

your dream job in cannabis and why we

1781
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:06,319
choose cannabis business even though the

1782
01:14:03,829 --> 01:14:08,239
risks are so high as of today there are

1783
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:10,670
over 100 videos that you can check out

welcome back you are listening to

1788
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:21,170
shaping fire I'm your host shingle nose

1789
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:24,529
and our guest this week is natural

1790
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:26,630
farming educator Eric Drake Weinert so

1791
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:29,059
I'm looking forward to this last set

1792
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:33,230
Eric we're gonna get you all over the

1793
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:37,130
place because I asked listeners of the

1794
01:14:33,229 --> 01:14:39,619
show to comment on some of the specific

1795
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:41,800
things in canif that they have a

1796
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:45,050
question about that they have never

1797
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:48,050
found online or heard mentioned in

1798
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:49,880
another interview so we're gonna kind of

1799
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,590
bounce around from topic to topic but

1800
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,659
these are really these are really

1801
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:56,659
specific questions so you might find

1802
01:14:53,659 --> 01:15:00,739
these entertaining alright so let's

1803
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:02,840
start with this one so most of the KNF

1804
01:15:00,739 --> 01:15:05,659
literature seems to be written for

1805
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,970
forested areas with the spread of

1806
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:10,309
cannabis cultivation to every part of

1807
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:12,440
the country people are making canif

1808
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:15,830
preparations to use on their crops

1809
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:19,369
everywhere how should wildcrafting and

1810
01:15:15,829 --> 01:15:22,340
KNF preparations adapt for dry in high

1811
01:15:19,369 --> 01:15:25,659
desert environments where nearly none of

1812
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:30,380
the typical can of plants are indigenous

1813
01:15:25,659 --> 01:15:31,880
especially when trying to collect imo

1814
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:34,400
in the dryness of the desert so

1815
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:36,650
essentially the question is how should

1816
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:40,849
we adapt any of these ideas we've talked

1817
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:42,439
today in hot dry environments that's

1818
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:44,180
well that's that's a great question

1819
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:47,689
because I've been working with folks up

1820
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:49,670
in a band organ and it's pretty desert

1821
01:15:47,689 --> 01:15:51,589
he up there and so they have these these

1822
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:54,829
similar challenges also been working

1823
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:58,610
with a few folks in Israel so if you

1824
01:15:54,829 --> 01:16:01,309
actually on my microbial secret society

1825
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:04,399
podcast I did two episodes with Sam

1826
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:07,250
Bevins and we talked about KNF in the

1827
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:09,829
desert specifically of how to do it you

1828
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:12,199
know how to do these collections but

1829
01:16:09,829 --> 01:16:14,779
ideally you know if you're in the desert

1830
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:17,989
and you're trying to collect IMO there

1831
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:21,229
are tons of IMO's in the desert if you

1832
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:23,420
look at the the desert sand it's it

1833
01:16:21,229 --> 01:16:25,669
actually creates this crust that you'll

1834
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:27,739
see living on the top and those are

1835
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:30,500
those are microbes that form this micro

1836
01:16:27,739 --> 01:16:32,779
crust to be there the difference like I

1837
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:34,909
was saying earlier about microbial

1838
01:16:32,779 --> 01:16:36,800
collection is that it's about moisture

1839
01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:39,829
content whether you're successful or not

1840
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:43,400
and so because you're in a desert you

1841
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:46,039
may need to have your rice be a little

1842
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:48,199
bit more moist and or what what I

1843
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:50,479
learned directly from a Master Choa for

1844
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:53,119
collecting the desert is to go to that

1845
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:56,239
area before you're gonna collect in for

1846
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:58,819
a week before everyday use what we call

1847
01:16:56,239 --> 01:17:01,969
the maintenance solution so that's from

1848
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:05,539
an implant juice with Oh H n brown rice

1849
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:07,460
vinegar and a structure in it or double

1850
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:09,470
use anyway I don't want to get into the

1851
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:10,730
acronyms but but it's them it's the

1852
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:12,400
maintenance solution that you would use

1853
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:14,629
and what that is is it's a bunch of

1854
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:17,179
biostimulants that with that moisture

1855
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:20,119
for for a week before you're watering

1856
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:22,550
that area it's increasing that a lot of

1857
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:24,529
the biological activity but then when

1858
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:27,590
you go to set your collection box in

1859
01:17:24,529 --> 01:17:29,899
that area um then you don't water it

1860
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:31,670
because you want to bio stimulate this

1861
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:33,889
area but then you want the toughest guys

1862
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:36,590
that have been encouraged to be

1863
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:39,200
strengthened to then go into your

1864
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:40,909
collection box so so there's ways of

1865
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,979
like kind of watering and pretty

1866
01:17:40,909 --> 01:17:43,969
stimulating the area but you don't want

1867
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:46,698
to like

1868
01:17:43,969 --> 01:17:49,609
the week guys bye-bye watering it at the

1869
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:51,589
same time you're collecting so there's

1870
01:17:49,609 --> 01:17:54,198
lots of lots of tips like that but we

1871
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:55,400
went really really into the desert

1872
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:58,609
because more and more of the Earth's

1873
01:17:55,399 --> 01:18:00,769
becoming a desert every day so very very

1874
01:17:58,609 --> 01:18:02,448
vital right on so anybody who's like

1875
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:05,290
especially into that make sure that you

1876
01:18:02,448 --> 01:18:08,389
double back to to Drake's

1877
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:11,600
microbial secret society podcast and

1878
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:13,910
listen to that in full so so let's take

1879
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,489
another one so the question is when we

1880
01:18:13,909 --> 01:18:20,119
are working our way from IMO one the

1881
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:24,769
collection to IMO for bringing it up to

1882
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:27,140
scale how best do we grade the result of

1883
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:29,120
each stage so that we know we have a

1884
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:33,530
good product before moving on to the

1885
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:35,420
next level well so yeah that's that's a

1886
01:18:33,529 --> 01:18:37,729
great question and and going going from

1887
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:40,039
your your initial collection of IMO one

1888
01:18:37,729 --> 01:18:42,259
which which I call a seed IMO collection

1889
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:44,180
so that that we kind of covered in the

1890
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,670
show of looking you know you're looking

1891
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:51,980
for that that white cotton candy kind of

1892
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:54,770
stuff and at least 80% good of where

1893
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:56,779
it's 80% kind of whitish 20% colors

1894
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:59,420
mixed in and then when you pick it up

1895
01:18:56,779 --> 01:19:02,420
you want it to be very firm not mushy so

1896
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:04,190
that's that's number one number two as

1897
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:06,469
you're moving that what I call that is

1898
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:08,960
just preserve seed IMO where you're

1899
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:11,930
putting it into sugar and there's really

1900
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,069
no gradient there the only thing you

1901
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:14,449
know you know you can't really evaluate

1902
01:19:13,069 --> 01:19:16,698
it because it's sleeping it's

1903
01:19:14,448 --> 01:19:20,238
hibernating the only thing you want to

1904
01:19:16,698 --> 01:19:22,939
watch for is if it's not sleeping so if

1905
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:25,009
I store my IMO and all this in and after

1906
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:28,339
a day or two after I've added the equal

1907
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:31,250
parts of sugar to the to storing it if

1908
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:33,949
it starts bubbling that means it's still

1909
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:35,810
active and it's not sleeping so if I

1910
01:19:33,948 --> 01:19:38,359
store that for a prolonged amount of

1911
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:40,880
time and it's still active it will

1912
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:44,149
degrade and I won't have it happening so

1913
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:47,060
as long as your IMO to your preserve

1914
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:49,429
seed IMO is not bubbling you can just

1915
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:51,230
take that as like it's it's good because

1916
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:53,390
you saw it at the one stage there's

1917
01:19:51,229 --> 01:19:54,948
there's really not a way to evaluate it

1918
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:57,680
other than waking it up and putting it

1919
01:19:54,948 --> 01:19:59,329
under a microscope so then

1920
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:03,710
when you're taking it up to the thirds

1921
01:19:59,329 --> 01:20:08,689
stage and what we call the propagating

1922
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:11,050
IMO's a propagated IMO you are really at

1923
01:20:08,689 --> 01:20:14,809
this stage this is when your nose nose

1924
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:16,869
see there are some visual indicators but

1925
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:20,210
really it's about the smell and

1926
01:20:16,869 --> 01:20:23,569
typically lately I've been using dog

1927
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:25,880
food and wood shavings to be a bulk

1928
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:27,559
substrate and when I first started it

1929
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,539
smells kind of oily like you know I'm

1930
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:31,670
just using pedigree dog food so you know

1931
01:20:29,539 --> 01:20:33,350
it has that pedigree oily smell to it

1932
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:34,970
and in the wood shavings you know

1933
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:39,170
whatever wood shavings smell they had

1934
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:41,600
but within the first 24 to 48 hours that

1935
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:44,329
smell goes away it's neutralized and

1936
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:47,390
what I end up with is a smell of a

1937
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:50,479
bakery like fresh fresh baked bread and

1938
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:53,660
and as I'm turning the pile and keeping

1939
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:55,849
it below 120 degrees and propagating it

1940
01:20:53,659 --> 01:20:58,670
through this process every time I go up

1941
01:20:55,850 --> 01:21:01,820
to turn the pile I'm smelling it and I'm

1942
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:04,329
also feeling the temperature and so if

1943
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:07,819
the smell ever smells like wet asphalt

1944
01:21:04,329 --> 01:21:10,369
that's the that's octene oh my C's and

1945
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:12,529
those are those are an indication that

1946
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:14,050
your pile is getting too hot and you're

1947
01:21:12,529 --> 01:21:16,519
starting to grow the wrong

1948
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:18,619
microorganisms so what you want to do is

1949
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,390
turn the pile so that you don't have

1950
01:21:18,619 --> 01:21:25,640
that smell and the temperature is is

1951
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:27,500
below 120 degrees and and then over the

1952
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:29,630
complexity it usually you're here in

1953
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:32,090
Hawaii it's about a week process it'll

1954
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:35,060
go from that smell of the oily stuff to

1955
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:38,539
that fresh-baked bread then to a smell

1956
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:40,460
of kind of like a really dank forest

1957
01:21:38,539 --> 01:21:41,840
like when you when you go into you know

1958
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:43,939
like if you went into the redwood forest

1959
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,340
you pick up a thing as soil and you

1960
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:48,229
smell that and that bad that Foresti

1961
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:50,150
smell that we have and that's an

1962
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:52,489
indication that the microbes you've

1963
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:55,129
propagated out are actually those soil

1964
01:21:52,489 --> 01:21:57,829
forest microbes that we wanted not these

1965
01:21:55,130 --> 01:22:00,590
high temperature I call them like rave

1966
01:21:57,829 --> 01:22:03,140
kids that are you know kind of strung

1967
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:05,270
out and stuff you produce the the dirt

1968
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:08,079
the soil kits the 4-h kids is what I

1969
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:10,310
call those guys right on well that's a

1970
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,119
go ahead and then and then in it one

1971
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:13,700
then

1972
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,470
the same thing that same smell that same

1973
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:17,389
kind of patterning is the same for your

1974
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:19,699
for stage where you're mixing in equal

1975
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:21,260
parts of soil to it you should you

1976
01:22:19,699 --> 01:22:23,779
should go through that same it should be

1977
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:25,489
kind of you know that that forest floor

1978
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:27,559
smell and never that act II know my

1979
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:30,439
scene smell and again that the

1980
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:33,010
temperature staying below 120 degrees so

1981
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:36,710
those are basically the you know smells

1982
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:38,420
temperature scene indicators and then

1983
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:40,460
other than that you know like if you

1984
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:44,329
really want to evaluate it you got to do

1985
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:46,579
like you know DNA testing and or the the

1986
01:22:44,329 --> 01:22:49,010
microscope microscopic tests but

1987
01:22:46,579 --> 01:22:50,659
sometimes testing with a microscope

1988
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:52,400
you're not gonna see all these beautiful

1989
01:22:50,659 --> 01:22:55,849
fungal hyphae and all these things

1990
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:57,289
because they're in spore form you know

1991
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:59,570
you know like when they're in sugar they

1992
01:22:57,289 --> 01:23:01,399
go into these spores so so you're not

1993
01:22:59,569 --> 01:23:02,899
necessarily gonna you know put it under

1994
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:05,269
a microscope and just see all this great

1995
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:07,279
- may look like oh there's not that much

1996
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:09,110
happenin here but it's because they're

1997
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:12,500
all sport out in there they're in

1998
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:14,630
they're preserved form it's not lost on

1999
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:17,630
me that that everything that we're

2000
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:20,510
talking about that we're making part of

2001
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:23,510
the test for it being good and a success

2002
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:28,460
is that it's got smells that we like you

2003
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:31,039
know it seems like you know nature is no

2004
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:33,470
fool in that you know the things that we

2005
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:37,880
are going to want to engage with smells

2006
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:40,490
like you know bread and forest floor and

2007
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:43,940
sweet and things like that and things

2008
01:23:40,489 --> 01:23:46,069
that that smell like you know feces and

2009
01:23:43,939 --> 01:23:48,739
rotting are generally not what we want

2010
01:23:46,069 --> 01:23:50,569
just brings me back to the same way that

2011
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:52,789
we generally like to buy cannabis which

2012
01:23:50,569 --> 01:23:56,329
is the nose nose let your let your body

2013
01:23:52,789 --> 01:23:57,979
lead the way yep yep yep and and when

2014
01:23:56,329 --> 01:24:00,710
you bring those similarities it's it's

2015
01:23:57,979 --> 01:24:03,919
the same as so think of think of us and

2016
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:06,949
our temperature if we're in temperatures

2017
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:10,220
above a hundred and twenty degrees we

2018
01:24:06,949 --> 01:24:12,309
perish relatively quickly you know I'm

2019
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:15,199
talking Fahrenheit you know yeah but but

2020
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:17,390
yeah so so same like like if you put

2021
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:18,710
your hand into your micro pile and you

2022
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:20,869
can't leave it in there for like a

2023
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:22,730
minute comfortably you know I mean it's

2024
01:24:20,869 --> 01:24:24,948
gonna be warm right but it's like a hot

2025
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:27,109
tub but if you if you have to pull

2026
01:24:24,948 --> 01:24:29,928
your handout because it's at burning hot

2027
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:32,509
if it's burning you the microbes similar

2028
01:24:29,929 --> 01:24:34,819
there they're being burned as well so so

2029
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:36,829
this analogy you bring of like us to

2030
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:40,009
them it's it's very it's very similar

2031
01:24:36,828 --> 01:24:43,279
yeah so the the next contributed

2032
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:47,739
question is why is brown rice vinegar so

2033
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:47,738
special compared to using other vinegars

2034
01:24:47,828 --> 01:24:52,549
brown rice vinegar so so largely in my

2035
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:56,059
practice right now

2036
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:59,659
I am NOT using brown rice vinegar what I

2037
01:24:56,059 --> 01:25:02,779
am using is a fruit vinegar so I get a

2038
01:24:59,658 --> 01:25:06,049
lot of bananas and I'll ferment and the

2039
01:25:02,779 --> 01:25:08,538
was into vinegar and as long as the pH

2040
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:10,099
is below 2.4 I you know I got a vinegar

2041
01:25:08,538 --> 01:25:14,988
and there's a simple process to follow

2042
01:25:10,099 --> 01:25:18,498
but that that that the reason for brown

2043
01:25:14,988 --> 01:25:22,578
rice vinegar is that the brown rice and

2044
01:25:18,498 --> 01:25:25,760
also the fruits upon metabolization when

2045
01:25:22,578 --> 01:25:28,368
your body when a plant or a body absorbs

2046
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,708
it it tends to flip it from being an

2047
01:25:28,368 --> 01:25:33,679
acidic condition into being an

2048
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:37,488
alkalizing condition and I don't think

2049
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:40,639
that property is true for like Heinz

2050
01:25:37,488 --> 01:25:43,248
white vinegar I think just because it's

2051
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:45,469
largely like acetic acid and I'm not

2052
01:25:43,248 --> 01:25:48,590
sure I'm not sure on the scientific

2053
01:25:45,469 --> 01:25:51,439
subtleties of what's happening but but

2054
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:54,110
I've been told that the the fruit

2055
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:56,748
vinegars or the grain vinegars are the

2056
01:25:54,109 --> 01:25:58,639
ones you want to use but in my in my

2057
01:25:56,748 --> 01:26:01,038
personal understanding of it

2058
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:03,949
I really just recommend people make a

2059
01:26:01,038 --> 01:26:05,359
living vinegar so so in up in the

2060
01:26:03,948 --> 01:26:08,058
Pacific Northwest you know making

2061
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:10,149
vinegar out of pears or apples or or

2062
01:26:08,059 --> 01:26:12,650
plums or you know whatever fruits

2063
01:26:10,149 --> 01:26:14,268
strawberries you know blueberries all

2064
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:16,939
these all these fruits would give you a

2065
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:19,940
really good vinegar but having your own

2066
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:24,348
living vinegar brings in so many more

2067
01:26:19,939 --> 01:26:26,658
enzymes and amino acids and all kinds of

2068
01:26:24,349 --> 01:26:29,538
stuff that we don't even know about

2069
01:26:26,658 --> 01:26:32,478
vinegar is one of the most powerful

2070
01:26:29,538 --> 01:26:34,429
tools like when you put vinegar on a

2071
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:37,159
leaf surface it actually creates more

2072
01:26:34,429 --> 01:26:38,868
wax on the plant surface which makes it

2073
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:42,319
more resistant to things like

2074
01:26:38,868 --> 01:26:45,380
powdery mildew or you know bacterial

2075
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:48,170
leaf conditions and so vinegar vinegar

2076
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:50,569
having a living vinegar is I would say

2077
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:54,380
really vital and then making it from

2078
01:26:50,569 --> 01:27:00,019
fruits or grains is the way to have this

2079
01:26:54,380 --> 01:27:01,639
this alkalizing effect right on that's

2080
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:04,460
more about vinegars than I've ever known

2081
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:06,289
and and now it actually sounds your and

2082
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:09,260
you're right we do have a lot of late

2083
01:27:06,289 --> 01:27:11,539
season fruit on our trees that just goes

2084
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:13,820
bad and it would be really great to use

2085
01:27:11,539 --> 01:27:16,609
those pears and apples to make you know

2086
01:27:13,819 --> 01:27:18,859
custom local vinegars that'll be you

2087
01:27:16,609 --> 01:27:21,380
know packed with beneficial local

2088
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:24,710
microbes so so this next question I

2089
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:26,989
almost didn't include and and the

2090
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:29,569
question is can we collect IMO in

2091
01:27:26,988 --> 01:27:32,089
plastic if we only have access to

2092
01:27:29,569 --> 01:27:33,710
treated wood and in my head it's like

2093
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:36,500
you know look a little harder for

2094
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:39,609
untreated wood but the idea behind the

2095
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:43,819
question is is pretty engaging so so

2096
01:27:39,609 --> 01:27:48,460
what what if any impact wit wood

2097
01:27:43,819 --> 01:27:48,460
collecting and plastic have for our IMO

2098
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:56,059
well I often I often see people try to

2099
01:27:52,158 --> 01:27:58,009
use a plastic tub to to collect IMO but

2100
01:27:56,060 --> 01:28:00,170
but when one thing one thing's for sure

2101
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:01,909
is that the plastic is non-breathable

2102
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:04,010
even not even unlike on the micro level

2103
01:28:01,908 --> 01:28:06,219
you know it's like it doesn't let air

2104
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:09,170
through the same way as wood does and

2105
01:28:06,219 --> 01:28:11,239
also the micro space is tighter right

2106
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:13,010
they in wood even though it looks solid

2107
01:28:11,238 --> 01:28:15,649
to us if you really zoom in there's a

2108
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:17,630
lot of holes in it and so microbes are

2109
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:21,618
able to pass through these natural

2110
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:24,050
materials so I would I would say to you

2111
01:28:21,618 --> 01:28:26,539
know what often actually what what I

2112
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:29,630
find to be a really good thing to use is

2113
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:35,060
go to your local thrift store and look

2114
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:36,650
for like a wicker basket like a like an

2115
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:39,050
Easter basket or something you know you

2116
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:42,170
know like how woven out a grass basket

2117
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:45,739
type of thing yeah and those are great

2118
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:49,010
choices that the idea of a cedar box I I

2119
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:51,589
there are certain reasons for it that it

2120
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:52,730
selects for certain microbes but largely

2121
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:54,440
what we've been using

2122
01:28:52,729 --> 01:28:56,959
here in Hawaii we even take up like a

2123
01:28:54,439 --> 01:28:59,929
piece of bamboo and cut it in half and

2124
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:03,109
just put the rice in there or I often

2125
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:06,980
use lauhala baskets or these other you

2126
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:09,409
know woven natural materials in and of

2127
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:11,119
course that like what I recommend is you

2128
01:29:09,409 --> 01:29:12,829
know if you're up there and you like

2129
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:15,349
like if you're in the Pacific Northwest

2130
01:29:12,829 --> 01:29:17,630
and you got blackberries the weave a

2131
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:19,520
basket out of the black berry vine and

2132
01:29:17,630 --> 01:29:22,279
then collect in that and you're getting

2133
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:25,370
even more of this indigenous stuff in

2134
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:26,840
there so so so that what I'm trying to

2135
01:29:25,369 --> 01:29:29,390
get at with it with this and that

2136
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:31,190
plastic question is is just avoid the

2137
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:33,320
plastic the plastic is not your friend

2138
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:35,000
it's not breathable it's not you know

2139
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:36,920
like imagine you're pressed up against

2140
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,238
the plastic them and furthermore you're

2141
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:40,489
trying to get the microbes to move

2142
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:42,799
through your container like up into your

2143
01:29:40,488 --> 01:29:45,019
rice because it I actually buried a

2144
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,150
thing significantly down in the like in

2145
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:50,270
the ground especially if I'm in colder

2146
01:29:47,149 --> 01:29:52,279
regions but but plastic will not allow

2147
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:55,220
those microbes to move from the soil

2148
01:29:52,279 --> 01:29:56,479
through the container into the rice so

2149
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:58,760
largely if you're collecting in a

2150
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:01,129
plastic container majority of the

2151
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:04,250
microbes you're seeing are actually from

2152
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:06,920
the air which are not the soil microbes

2153
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:08,840
you're looking for wow that's really

2154
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:12,199
interesting I like I like the elegance

2155
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:14,750
of your answer to that it's not really

2156
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:17,029
about wood or plastic it's definitely

2157
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:19,600
not plastic but there's all these other

2158
01:30:17,029 --> 01:30:22,460
solutions other than wood I like that

2159
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:25,280
yeah there's tons I mean like like Oh

2160
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:27,230
like I used to use cardboard boxes I

2161
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:29,238
don't I don't really recommend that at

2162
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:31,159
all bit because like there's there's

2163
01:30:29,238 --> 01:30:34,279
better things like these natural woven

2164
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:37,819
materials but but like like I said don't

2165
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:40,969
let anything stop you so our next

2166
01:30:37,819 --> 01:30:43,759
question is and listener asked what your

2167
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:46,760
thoughts are on non-dairy alternatives

2168
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:53,630
for making la be such as oat milk or

2169
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:56,449
bean milk so la B la B is the most

2170
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:57,770
prevalent microbe on on earth and in in

2171
01:30:56,449 --> 01:30:59,960
the milky way I would say it's the most

2172
01:30:57,770 --> 01:31:02,110
powerful microbe in the Milky Way so

2173
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:05,659
it's kind of omnipresent everywhere and

2174
01:31:02,109 --> 01:31:06,738
the recipe that we follow in in Korean

2175
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:09,019
natural farming

2176
01:31:06,738 --> 01:31:12,259
is a process of putting out starch water

2177
01:31:09,019 --> 01:31:13,729
to collect diverse leb then it goes

2178
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:16,458
through a process where we pour that

2179
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:18,860
into milk and what that does is my first

2180
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:22,788
starch water I collected all kinds of

2181
01:31:18,859 --> 01:31:25,609
everything but la B grew the fastest so

2182
01:31:22,788 --> 01:31:28,399
it's the highest population when I pour

2183
01:31:25,609 --> 01:31:30,288
that into the milk the milk eliminates

2184
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:33,649
all the other bacteria because they can

2185
01:31:30,288 --> 01:31:35,988
no longer digest the lactose sugar and

2186
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:38,238
only that really that la B thrives at

2187
01:31:35,988 --> 01:31:40,188
that so what the second step by adding

2188
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:43,578
the culture like the starch water into

2189
01:31:40,189 --> 01:31:45,289
the rice is a purification step so when

2190
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:47,058
then when I pour that serum off and

2191
01:31:45,288 --> 01:31:50,828
after it separates into the curds and

2192
01:31:47,059 --> 01:31:53,208
the way the way is largely purely

2193
01:31:50,828 --> 01:31:56,688
lactobacillus and there's not many other

2194
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:58,519
bacteria in there so that so that's the

2195
01:31:56,689 --> 01:32:00,679
process we go through in natural farming

2196
01:31:58,519 --> 01:32:04,070
with the milk it acts as a purification

2197
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:06,319
step so the question is do you need that

2198
01:32:04,069 --> 01:32:09,498
purification step can you just leave the

2199
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:12,259
rice wash out and just catch the LA B in

2200
01:32:09,498 --> 01:32:15,679
there and use that as Li B the answer is

2201
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:17,900
yes you can like in in in Korea for

2202
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,760
animal farming they're just taking rice

2203
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:22,609
bran and mixing it into water and

2204
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,559
letting the LAV naturally come from the

2205
01:32:22,609 --> 01:32:27,679
air and ferment and it'll start bubbling

2206
01:32:24,559 --> 01:32:29,748
after a day or two and they call that la

2207
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:32,208
B but even though it's other

2208
01:32:29,748 --> 01:32:34,969
contaminants the difference is with that

2209
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:36,708
you have a shorter shelf life that if

2210
01:32:34,969 --> 01:32:38,899
you don't do the purification through

2211
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:41,359
the milk then you can't really preserve

2212
01:32:38,899 --> 01:32:42,768
it because you the microbes don't settle

2213
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:44,948
down the same way and there's too much

2214
01:32:42,769 --> 01:32:47,989
water and all these other other

2215
01:32:44,948 --> 01:32:50,089
considerations so with that alone by

2216
01:32:47,988 --> 01:32:52,009
just mixing rice bran into water and

2217
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:55,849
stirring it up and letting it sit out

2218
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:58,010
you get an L a B so you could just every

2219
01:32:55,849 --> 01:32:59,719
day on demand say oh I'm gonna make la B

2220
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,939
next week two days before I mix it up

2221
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:05,149
make it and use it and you don't have to

2222
01:33:01,939 --> 01:33:07,189
go through this rice process so so so

2223
01:33:05,149 --> 01:33:12,708
system in the milk process I follow you

2224
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:15,439
so um put differently oat milk and bean

2225
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:20,269
milk are not recommended because they

2226
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:20,659
are not lactose based milks therefore

2227
01:33:20,269 --> 01:33:24,829
they

2228
01:33:20,659 --> 01:33:28,760
will not do the the cleansing process

2229
01:33:24,829 --> 01:33:32,029
that we intentionally use animal milk

2230
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:35,890
for and if somebody for some reason

2231
01:33:32,029 --> 01:33:38,389
wanted to make their la be without dairy

2232
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:40,789
causing them to consider oat milk or

2233
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:44,660
bean milk their real solution is just

2234
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:46,909
not to skip the milk step and and keep

2235
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:48,769
it with all of these other wild microbes

2236
01:33:46,909 --> 01:33:52,039
in it just use it more just use it

2237
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:54,110
faster well yeah well to a degree to

2238
01:33:52,039 --> 01:33:59,090
agree to agree let me let me clarify

2239
01:33:54,109 --> 01:34:03,019
that a little bit because um saying that

2240
01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:05,750
you know like like so so to go back a

2241
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:08,930
little bit there is a way like Master

2242
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:10,520
Choa actually has a recipe in his his

2243
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:13,850
older book that I don't thinks in

2244
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:17,990
publication anymore but it talks about a

2245
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:20,210
preparation where you cook beans and and

2246
01:34:17,989 --> 01:34:22,609
then you put the beans plus water in a

2247
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:25,310
jar and then you put that jar in your

2248
01:34:22,609 --> 01:34:28,939
refrigerator and after about a month

2249
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:31,160
that is la be so he's doing it with just

2250
01:34:28,939 --> 01:34:33,409
straight-up beans and and through this

2251
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:35,750
process where when you put it in a jar

2252
01:34:33,409 --> 01:34:39,319
and you seal it that way you create this

2253
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:41,960
anaerobic condition where lactobacillus

2254
01:34:39,319 --> 01:34:45,049
is facultative li anaerobic meaning and

2255
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:47,029
live with or without oxygen and so the

2256
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:50,119
cook beans sitting in the water in this

2257
01:34:47,029 --> 01:34:53,300
anaerobic environment in your fridge the

2258
01:34:50,119 --> 01:34:56,180
LAV will also predominate and by that

2259
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:59,630
you can also get a really pure la B

2260
01:34:56,180 --> 01:35:01,940
serum from being milk type of thing and

2261
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:05,930
this this is similar for other nut milks

2262
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:07,699
although I'm not like someone was asking

2263
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:10,909
me about almond milk the other day and

2264
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:12,470
I'm not like I just I just don't buy

2265
01:35:10,909 --> 01:35:14,809
almond milk so I haven't done the

2266
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:17,510
research myself to know right on fair

2267
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:19,220
enough fair enough so the next listener

2268
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:22,550
question is how about fermenting

2269
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:24,860
mushrooms is there something like an FMJ

2270
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:29,570
or something like a fermented mushroom

2271
01:35:24,859 --> 01:35:31,909
juice yeah you - if your mushrooms are

2272
01:35:29,569 --> 01:35:34,609
fresh you could treat them just like

2273
01:35:31,909 --> 01:35:37,609
plant you know plant material

2274
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:39,559
and because mushrooms aren't very sweet

2275
01:35:37,609 --> 01:35:41,599
you don't need very much sugar so

2276
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:43,190
probably like about a third of the

2277
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,340
weight of your mushrooms could be sugar

2278
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:47,960
because they just they're not sweet and

2279
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:49,579
then that will extract them out you can

2280
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:52,279
make a fermented plant juice that way

2281
01:35:49,579 --> 01:35:54,408
out of the mushrooms for sure and if

2282
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:56,779
your mushrooms are dried you could

2283
01:35:54,408 --> 01:35:58,819
follow us a similar process to how we do

2284
01:35:56,779 --> 01:36:01,729
it in the the medicine or the o hn

2285
01:35:58,819 --> 01:36:04,639
recipe where we mix in beer to

2286
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:06,500
reconstitute them and then we act as if

2287
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:10,909
it was wet ingredients by fermenting

2288
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:13,760
after that right on so I like this

2289
01:36:10,908 --> 01:36:15,649
question lots of folks fail making their

2290
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,110
can off concoction the first time they

2291
01:36:15,649 --> 01:36:21,049
make it sometimes we fail several times

2292
01:36:18,109 --> 01:36:23,809
even experienced folks what can you do

2293
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:26,329
with your K and F failures let's say you

2294
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:28,250
make some fpj and it gets moldy does it

2295
01:36:26,329 --> 01:36:29,988
go in the compost pile same with the

2296
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:33,368
labs if it goes wrong can any of the

2297
01:36:29,988 --> 01:36:37,309
stuff be repurposed or is it just tossed

2298
01:36:33,368 --> 01:36:39,319
well let's answer that specifically

2299
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:41,600
where you're saying you have an fpga and

2300
01:36:39,319 --> 01:36:43,789
then it goes mouldy if you're just

2301
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,800
talking about surface mold that's

2302
01:36:43,789 --> 01:36:48,198
growing on the very very top of the the

2303
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:50,719
jar and sometimes you get white wispy

2304
01:36:48,198 --> 01:36:53,719
things sometimes like when I do ginger

2305
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:56,389
sometimes I get like green little films

2306
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:59,359
growing those things usually they're

2307
01:36:56,389 --> 01:37:01,969
pretty inert and if you see that type of

2308
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:04,368
mold growing on top you can assume that

2309
01:37:01,969 --> 01:37:06,679
your fermentation underneath is done and

2310
01:37:04,368 --> 01:37:08,899
usually what I do in that instance is I

2311
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:11,899
just pour it off and then super saturate

2312
01:37:08,899 --> 01:37:14,479
to preserve it so I I'm not tossing

2313
01:37:11,899 --> 01:37:16,879
those if there's a little mold or those

2314
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:19,069
things and if it is molding it you know

2315
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,569
maybe pull it earlier it's is what it

2316
01:37:19,069 --> 01:37:24,139
you know it's what it's indicating to

2317
01:37:20,569 --> 01:37:27,109
you because fermentation is complete but

2318
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:30,380
largely all all my things that I fail

2319
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:32,689
with that's what I go over to like the G

2320
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:36,279
DOM methods so it's it's master chose

2321
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:39,019
Sun Jung seung-jo who basically

2322
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:41,329
developed a really ultra low-cost way of

2323
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:43,460
doing things and he'll take any of

2324
01:37:41,329 --> 01:37:45,349
anything like plant material and just

2325
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,480
mix it with water and a bucket and let

2326
01:37:45,349 --> 01:37:50,619
it get mmm

2327
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:52,439
asthey and then diluted enough that it

2328
01:37:50,619 --> 01:37:55,180
it doesn't cause too many problems

2329
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:57,129
although although this this is where you

2330
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:59,200
know if you're into food safety or into

2331
01:37:57,130 --> 01:38:01,600
medical grade cannabis and these things

2332
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:03,789
you gotta watch out like I'm not

2333
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,980
you're not saying like this is your

2334
01:38:03,789 --> 01:38:07,810
solution for that but but it's a way

2335
01:38:05,979 --> 01:38:10,269
where for instance if you mess something

2336
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:12,760
up you you ferment it using these

2337
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:15,190
techniques that youngsang cho promotes

2338
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:17,619
and then use it to bio remediate your

2339
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:18,969
local park you know like like do do some

2340
01:38:17,619 --> 01:38:21,159
good for the community kind of thing

2341
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:25,150
with your mistakes you know totally my

2342
01:38:21,159 --> 01:38:27,250
mistakes go to the base of my trees and

2343
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:28,449
such in the yard because you know

2344
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:30,880
there's a lot of this stuff I don't want

2345
01:38:28,449 --> 01:38:33,130
to put on a cannabis plant that'll you

2346
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:35,010
know will eventually get smoked or you

2347
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:38,890
know turned into a tincture or something

2348
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:41,800
but but it's also not worthwhile to like

2349
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:43,030
dispose of as if it's hazmat and you

2350
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,500
know you can put out something mediocre

2351
01:38:43,029 --> 01:38:47,859
into the environment and the environment

2352
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:50,350
will be stoked yeah and it really really

2353
01:38:47,859 --> 01:38:52,119
really it comes down to what when it's a

2354
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:55,120
contaminate it's it really has to do

2355
01:38:52,119 --> 01:38:57,159
with concentration in this case and so

2356
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:59,649
so if you're worried about you know it

2357
01:38:57,159 --> 01:39:03,519
being a contaminant spray some la beyond

2358
01:38:59,649 --> 01:39:04,960
it and and diluted enough and and you

2359
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:08,770
know that that should take care of most

2360
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:11,050
most problems I love how we use adding

2361
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:13,480
you know spray la beyond it as a

2362
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:15,489
solution for like everything it reminds

2363
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:17,349
me of how everybody talks about CBD now

2364
01:39:15,488 --> 01:39:19,149
right it's like oh it doesn't matter

2365
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:22,270
you just throw some lab on it you'll be

2366
01:39:19,149 --> 01:39:27,369
all good pretty soon we're gonna have

2367
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:30,460
gas station la being yeah so next

2368
01:39:27,369 --> 01:39:33,729
question is listener says we have some

2369
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:39,550
areas where we can get fish from for our

2370
01:39:33,729 --> 01:39:43,238
fa a locally but those those waterways

2371
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:46,630
are runoffs from Syngenta and Monsanto

2372
01:39:43,238 --> 01:39:49,329
farms are the fish safe to use or will

2373
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:51,670
there be residuals in the FAA to worry

2374
01:39:49,329 --> 01:39:55,329
about have you done any testing to

2375
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:56,300
confirm whether not there any residuals

2376
01:39:55,329 --> 01:39:58,429
in

2377
01:39:56,300 --> 01:40:04,130
in fish and how that may come out in the

2378
01:39:58,429 --> 01:40:05,328
FAA that that is that's an interesting

2379
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:07,039
question

2380
01:40:05,328 --> 01:40:09,229
they definitely be studied more

2381
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:10,760
scientifically III want to I want to

2382
01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:13,129
bring up a different instance of this

2383
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,719
where I just I had some folks from

2384
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:16,069
Washington DC visiting me the other day

2385
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,899
and I opened up the fish and they were

2386
01:40:16,069 --> 01:40:20,238
like you know I had a three-month-old

2387
01:40:17,899 --> 01:40:21,799
batch and I had a year old batch and you

2388
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:23,658
could smell the difference between them

2389
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:25,909
the three three year old batch kind of

2390
01:40:23,658 --> 01:40:28,609
exhibiting the three month old batch

2391
01:40:25,908 --> 01:40:31,549
kind of smelled still a little fishy but

2392
01:40:28,609 --> 01:40:34,759
the year old batch smelled really smooth

2393
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:36,289
and sweet like like you know you like

2394
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:38,719
it's hard it's hard to describe smells

2395
01:40:36,289 --> 01:40:41,300
through through you know but but there

2396
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:43,639
was a difference in it and so what I was

2397
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:47,059
talking to them about is that one of my

2398
01:40:43,639 --> 01:40:50,750
friends took his FAA that he had done

2399
01:40:47,059 --> 01:40:54,770
this process he sent it to a lab to do

2400
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:57,439
path led pathogen testing and they said

2401
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:58,820
that his la be the raw fish and sugar

2402
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:02,448
that was put in a bucket at room

2403
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:06,558
temperature had less pathogens than most

2404
01:41:02,448 --> 01:41:08,448
people's kitchens so so if you're

2405
01:41:06,559 --> 01:41:11,659
thinking about it biologically the

2406
01:41:08,448 --> 01:41:15,259
answer of why that is the case is the

2407
01:41:11,658 --> 01:41:18,379
fish amino acid itself has tons of

2408
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:19,730
lactic acid bacteria in it and so these

2409
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:22,730
microbes again as we're talking

2410
01:41:19,729 --> 01:41:23,988
throughout this show they're as you get

2411
01:41:22,729 --> 01:41:26,959
these microbes they're not only

2412
01:41:23,988 --> 01:41:29,569
processing out like the pathogens but in

2413
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,609
your FAA they can almost digest by the

2414
01:41:29,569 --> 01:41:35,328
time you have a year old batch and it's

2415
01:41:31,609 --> 01:41:38,779
a smooth fine tasting fine like cooking

2416
01:41:35,328 --> 01:41:40,698
level of fish sauce you end up where if

2417
01:41:38,779 --> 01:41:43,219
the pathogens were processed through

2418
01:41:40,698 --> 01:41:45,229
fermentation I would also believe any

2419
01:41:43,219 --> 01:41:47,960
runoff that's coming that's maybe like

2420
01:41:45,229 --> 01:41:49,779
atrazine or glyphosate or any any of

2421
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:52,399
those types of things they would also be

2422
01:41:49,779 --> 01:41:54,439
disassembled by this same microbial set

2423
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:57,319
otherwise that microbes would be

2424
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:59,029
inhibited and you wouldn't have them you

2425
01:41:57,319 --> 01:42:01,429
know so so by the time you're a year

2426
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:03,649
into it it's like so much fermentation

2427
01:42:01,429 --> 01:42:06,710
so much smoothness has come that that

2428
01:42:03,649 --> 01:42:08,960
your real it your real contaminants

2429
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:10,109
should be very low but I would love to

2430
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,850
take that claim I just

2431
01:42:10,109 --> 01:42:14,368
made and then you know run it through a

2432
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:16,350
mass spectrometers yeah right and get to

2433
01:42:14,368 --> 01:42:20,069
know that the science is in support of

2434
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:21,840
your your gut intuition yeah and I just

2435
01:42:20,069 --> 01:42:23,250
I mean I just don't have the you know if

2436
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:28,100
someone wants to go fund me for that

2437
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:32,029
awesome so the last one of these uh

2438
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:35,159
audience questions is from somebody who

2439
01:42:32,029 --> 01:42:37,139
follows your YouTube channel that will

2440
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:40,319
plug in a bit and listens to your

2441
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:43,980
podcast and they're curious to know from

2442
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:45,868
you they say that they like your quality

2443
01:42:43,979 --> 01:42:47,698
of information and they know that they

2444
01:42:45,868 --> 01:42:49,259
can rely on it they want to know if

2445
01:42:47,698 --> 01:42:53,039
there are any other sources of

2446
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:56,699
information that you think are quite

2447
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:58,939
accurate as well that they should look

2448
01:42:56,698 --> 01:42:58,939
into

2449
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:03,750
definitely there's there's a there's a

2450
01:43:01,469 --> 01:43:06,448
lot of good resources in Korean natural

2451
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:08,158
farming I you know one thing one thing I

2452
01:43:06,448 --> 01:43:10,529
want I want to shout out Kris I just I

2453
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:12,000
just want to make sure you know that you

2454
01:43:10,529 --> 01:43:14,550
know he and I have been allies

2455
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:17,279
throughout for a long time and and we

2456
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:19,770
built both been to Korea to learn from

2457
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:21,868
Master Choa and he's now in Boise and

2458
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:26,280
he's offering classes that I that I

2459
01:43:21,868 --> 01:43:28,889
think his his his depth of understanding

2460
01:43:26,279 --> 01:43:32,250
and his thing it's just the proof is in

2461
01:43:28,889 --> 01:43:36,810
his pudding so to say like he's proved

2462
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:38,550
it out and and done it so so so he has

2463
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:39,929
classes he's been doing that stuff he's

2464
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:43,650
putting out information I think he's a

2465
01:43:39,929 --> 01:43:47,069
reputable source in the Big Island it

2466
01:43:43,649 --> 01:43:49,469
used to be Kim Chang was was you know

2467
01:43:47,069 --> 01:43:51,719
was my instructor and also you know now

2468
01:43:49,469 --> 01:43:53,819
now a peer of mine but but she recently

2469
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:56,939
had some medical issues so she's harder

2470
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:58,710
to get access to and then I would I

2471
01:43:56,939 --> 01:44:01,789
would reach out to folks that have

2472
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:05,779
studied with master chose specifically

2473
01:44:01,789 --> 01:44:08,279
just just because if if your fault like

2474
01:44:05,779 --> 01:44:10,469
they're there there's a lot of different

2475
01:44:08,279 --> 01:44:14,729
sources out there that have differing

2476
01:44:10,469 --> 01:44:16,649
degrees of quality which is which is a

2477
01:44:14,729 --> 01:44:19,709
lot of the reason why I decided to call

2478
01:44:16,649 --> 01:44:21,509
this stuff I'm doing pure KNF because

2479
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:24,000
I'm really following that the the

2480
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:25,739
recipes Master Choa gave the

2481
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,380
be my my years of study I'm

2482
01:44:25,739 --> 01:44:30,300
incorporating this and and then there's

2483
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:32,220
other aspects of it where you can bring

2484
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:34,800
in these Jew Dom techniques and these

2485
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:37,530
these other maybe old lower-cost

2486
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:40,050
techniques and blends and you gotta find

2487
01:44:37,529 --> 01:44:41,939
what works for you but in terms of you

2488
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:44,400
know researching material learning from

2489
01:44:41,939 --> 01:44:46,739
folks you know I think any of the

2490
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:50,699
students that that we've put out between

2491
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:53,609
Kim Chris myself Master Choa those those

2492
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:54,479
folks are great here here on the Big

2493
01:44:53,609 --> 01:44:57,059
Island in Hawaii

2494
01:44:54,479 --> 01:45:00,839
Logan is starting up the Holly Selassie

2495
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:05,210
I natural farming Institute and he has

2496
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:07,980
been of all the people that I that I

2497
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:09,800
don't know personally he's been going

2498
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:13,109
into the cannabis realm of just like

2499
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:16,260
beyond belief you know that that's his

2500
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:18,089
that's his jam and he so he is natural

2501
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:20,270
farming Institute he's starting here

2502
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:22,560
he's coming from more the esoteric

2503
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:24,810
spiritual you know that the higher parts

2504
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:28,850
of the cannabis that it brings in but

2505
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:32,160
he's he's a great resource yeah so

2506
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:34,500
there's that yeah that's great and I'm

2507
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:37,050
assuming that anybody who's who's

2508
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:39,239
listening to with us especially this far

2509
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:41,070
in the show knows that when you refer to

2510
01:45:39,239 --> 01:45:45,510
Chris we're talking about Chris Trump

2511
01:45:41,069 --> 01:45:48,809
and his his website is natural farming

2512
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:50,430
dot CEO but you know they're very likely

2513
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:52,500
some you know very possible somebody's

2514
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:54,270
listening to this episode and they just

2515
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:56,340
got turned on to Corrine natural farming

2516
01:45:54,270 --> 01:46:01,980
and my god if we just turned you on to

2517
01:45:56,340 --> 01:46:05,250
Chris Trump well lucky you so yeah yeah

2518
01:46:01,979 --> 01:46:07,589
so um and so Drake thank you so much for

this show with you and it was nice to

2524
01:46:19,829 --> 01:46:25,140
kind of poke at some of the parts that

2525
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:27,960
can of KNF that you know that don't

2526

Drake why nerds educational

2536
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:59,369
opportunities the best place to start is

2537
01:46:55,109 --> 01:47:01,619
at pure K and F dot-com that will tell

2538
01:46:59,369 --> 01:47:03,090
you all about his available classes when

2539
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:05,699
they start where they are and his

2540
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:08,130
speaking schedule he's also got a really

2541
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:11,819
great YouTube and the easiest way to get

2542
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:14,369
to that is just a search K and F video

2543

and you'll come across all sorts of

2544
01:47:14,369 --> 01:47:17,819
things and one of the things that I like

2545
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:19,530
about his youtube channel is that not

2546
01:47:17,819 --> 01:47:23,539
