2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:13,559
sometimes old things hold a lot of value

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,838
it is true that I like fancy hotel rooms

4
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,600
but honestly I get the best sleep

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,760
sleeping at my friend's old beach cabin

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,359
that still has quilts and Afghans that

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,240
his grandmother and probably his

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:29,039
great-grandmother made the cabin smells

9
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:31,358
of old wood seawater and late loud

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,359
nights of laughing playing board games

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,160
and uker and quiet early morning staring

12
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,399
at the crashing surf while the others

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,439
are still

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,280
asleep and it is also true I am grateful

15
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,119
for the prescriptions that help my

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,600
autoimmune issues but honestly I have

17
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,159
gotten far more lifelong Health from

host Shango Los my guest today is Jeff

57
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:24,518
nordal better known on Instagram as Jade

58
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,318
nectar Jeff has been studying cannabis

59
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,800
natural medicine and psychedelics since

60
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,199
his teens he has a background as an

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,439
early internet R preneur but became

62
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,839
seriously ill in his 30s only to find

63
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,919
out he had contracted Lyme disease

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,640
conventional medicine held no solutions

65
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,479
for him Jeff turned to cannabis medicine

66
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,919
in his home of Santa Cruz and started

67
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,518
getting results he became an expert on

68
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:50,079
the acid form of canabo and cannabis

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,158
leaf juicing and started a local medical

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,000
Collective to get it in the hands of

71
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:57,560
patients Jeff nordal now holds 11

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,519
patents for using cannabis as food

73
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,719
though he doesn't like patents and got

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,640
them defensively so no one could ever

75
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,120
tell him to stop juicing cannabis leaves

76
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,119
for patients he is presently building

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,759

80
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,120
varieties of cannabis than anyone I've

81
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,839

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,680

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,159

demands of land races hot and cold at

00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,318
adapted land races and hear about some

88
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,000
of the more exotic morphology and

89
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,639

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,759
and during the third set we will explore

91
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,878

that love kind of got became all plants

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,639
so to be able to see lots of varieties

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,840
of a plant together it's it's really

112

take much of encouragement to get me to

134
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,720
come to Santa Cruz it's one of my

135
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,000
favorite places in the world so all

136
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,280
right man well let's get right into it

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,120
you know um when people talk about land

138
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:24,399
races people use that word kind of like

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,399
a a bucket right because um a lot of

140
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,918
people don't understand the idea of land

141
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,079
race or or where that definition begins

142
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:31,959
or ends

143
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,359
and then it then it starts to get mixed

144
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:37,279
in with other words like you know like

145
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:41,080
Heritage and heirloom and and you know

146
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:44,000
varieties and and so the the definition

147
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:47,000
is is a bit muddied so so let's let's

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
kind of talk around this idea um and and

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,639
tease out some of the interesting

150
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,560
meanings especially somebody like you

151
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,600
who who spends their whole time you know

152
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,639
in the land race world I can imagine you

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,879
would have a different take on it so so

154
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,560
so so why don't we just go ahead and

155
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,800
start with like the word land race and

156
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,079
and why don't you get us started there

157
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,800
yeah yeah so uh land race and I had to

158
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:13,959
do my own research as well um and uh

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,918
yeah it it is interesting that even

160
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,918
different Industries and such have

161
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:22,519
different definitions for what land race

162
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:24,799
is but it it turns out that uh land race

163
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:28,879
I believe I should look this up but I

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,759
think it's a German word for land Ross I

165
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,319
think so that means uh and that

166
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,800
translates into English like country

167
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:40,439
breed so uh right off the bat land race

168
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,319
is domestic these are domesticated uh

169
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,478
varieties but you can also have land

170
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,960
raised dogs land raised pigs chickens

171
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:51,199
cucumbers melons um so it's nothing

172
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,918
specific to cannabis whatsoever it has

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,439
to do with uh just agriculture or animal

174
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,198
um uh

175
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:02,598
breeding and and what but what it is and

176
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:07,240
why land races are unique

177
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:10,399
is they're actually tied to a specific

178
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,759
region um so there's this interplay

179
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:19,279
between uh so let's say a cannabis plant

180
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,759
shows up in um some area let's say in I

181
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,359
don't know

182
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,120
Thailand

183
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,439
um so there you've got a wet tropical

184
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,160
environment uh and and the people who

185
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,879
want to grow the Cannabis there are

186
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:38,199
going to be now uh breeding with with

187
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,840
their cannabis uh taking cues from the

188
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:46,199
environment over time so let's say they

189
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:49,878
grow 100 plants um but 50% if it were

190
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,560
let's say a like an Afghan or arid

191
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,319
environment uh genetic that that came to

192
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,199
this Village in Thailand you know

193
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,879
hundreds if not thousands of years ago

194
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,919
probably half of them would mold because

195
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,240
they're not

196
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,560
adapted

197
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:08,918
for uh all that moisture and humidity uh

198
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,478
but the humans would start picking you

199
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:14,598
know and taking the seeds from the

200
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:18,199
plants that actually fared pretty well

201
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:22,598
um so now there's human selection going

202
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:26,000
on to find those uh seeds or those

203
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,120
genetics that actually thrive in their

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,918
local

205
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,839
environment um so once that gets

206
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,439
established as far as something that can

207
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,760
actually survive and make it to the

208
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,000
Finish lineon produce you know flowers

209
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:42,879
without melting down uh now the humans

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,799
might start selecting more for

211
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,439
effects say I like a really or like

212
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:52,039
those that culture may actually

213
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,519
appreciate a very energizing electric

214
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:57,559
psychedelic uh effect in their cannabis

215
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:01,799
so then they start selecting uh for that

216
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:05,518
so now you're starting to infuse

217
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:10,278
cultural values and cultural utility

218
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,278
into this plant while also uh uh

219
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:16,519
selecting for things that actually

220
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:19,519
Thrive um in that environment uh so

221
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:23,078
that's that's kind of the inner play

222
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,000
with uh for land race is it happens over

223
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:28,278
time with uh pressures from the

224
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,519
environment and also uh the aesthetic

225
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:34,399
and uh desire and utility of the humans

226
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,560
who are growing them andc and if these

227
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:41,320
were isolated from all other cannabis

228
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:44,719
plants uh you can imagine over you know

229
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,760
Generation generation 50 Generations 100

230
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,120
Generations now you're going to have a

231
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:53,439
very unique uh cannabis variety That's

232
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,480
Unique just to that particular let's say

233
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,800
Village you know you know Jee I think

234
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,278
I'm going to set you up for your next

235
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,439
definition because um you know you

236
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,399
already surprised me the definition of

237
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,040
land race already is not what I thought

238
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,200
it was going to be because um I was

239
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,759
under the impression that land races

240
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,240
were Untouched by humans that we had

241
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:14,838
like as soon as you said

242
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,159
domesticated like my my eyebrow goes up

243
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,440
cuzz I'm like domesticated no no no this

244
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,879
is this is one of the biggest biggest uh

245
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,680
I I don't know where the Genesis of this

246
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:31,639
am I talking about Wild versus land race

247
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:35,479
you're talking about wild or feral okay

248
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:38,199
uh yeah so so land race is

249
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,560
100% influenc by humans these are

250
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,879
domestic so so if we want to start

251
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:48,278
talking analogies here start thinking um

252
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:51,159
as far as dog breeds so uh if anyone's

253
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:54,200
familiar with let's say Anatolian

254
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:58,519
Shepherds or Kangle dogs these are uh

255
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,278
these big uh sheep uh protector guard

256
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,839
dogs that are used in in the Anatolian

257
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,799
mountains in turkey and they require a

258
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,240
very

259
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,759
large uh dog to fight off wolves and

260
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,200
bears uh they need to be very

261
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,600
independent uh they actually go out with

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,560
the Sheep without any humans and we'll

263
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,159
just watch after the Sheep but also go

264
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:24,759
and hunt and provide food for themselves

265
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,078
um but the Anatolian Shepherds it's not

266
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,600
a

267
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:33,958
specific uh standard breed that you know

268
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,600
has to be 16 in from tail to snout or

269
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,439
any of these standard breed Dimensions

270
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,000
uh within the Anatolian Shepherd or

271
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,920
Kangle uh type of dog uh you actually

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,559
get all different color types all

273
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,039
different uh

274
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,919
variations uh and such but they're but

275
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,519
at the same time they're similar and

276
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:58,958
they perform a utility which is guarding

277
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,759
sheep and being independent and also uh

278
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,000
being able to handle the environment so

279
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,600
they have a really nice double coat that

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,958
keeps them insulated in the winter but

281
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,079
uh cool in the summer um so so that's an

282
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,559
Anatolian Shepherd you also have things

283
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:18,519
like huskys uh Eskimo dogs you'll see

284
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:21,719
there are tons of variant in those

285
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,120
dogs uh between each one so you've got a

286
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,240
lot of genetic

287
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,879
diversity but it's also bred by humans

288
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,519
to pull do

289
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:36,198
slits uh but there's no uh you know like

290
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,879
Kennel Club sitting there going and

291
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:41,198
measuring the dogs for specific traits

292
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,879
it's and so th those are actually

293
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:48,120
considered landra dogs and you can apply

294
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:51,759
the same thing to carrots cucumbers

295
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,519
pigs uh so I I find it very interesting

296
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:59,720
that a now now in my head um a a

297
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,799
cultural use and uh human intention is

298
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,920
now part of the land race definition for

299
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,719
me and that's a and that's a surprise

300
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,399
for me so so let's let's move forward

301
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,440
and and and have you talk a little bit

302
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,600
about the the feral and wild type which

303
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,760
is what was in my head as land race okay

304
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,800
and here's another thing this is um and

305
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,480
by the way I have read websites cannabis

306
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,519
websites that just kind of become these

307
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,159
Echo chambers that just poach other

308
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,399
information just keep repeating the same

309
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:32,198
fallacy yeah over and over

310
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,919
and for some reason there are cannabis

311
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:38,958
websites that do Define land race as

312
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,838
wild Untouched by humans and that well

313
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,958
we all know that most of the Cannabis

314
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,519
websites are garbage anyway they're just

315
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,319
people trying to throw up content so

316
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,120
they can sell advertising you know well

317
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,519
so so right off the bat just land race

318
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,600
is fully domestic just do a Google

319
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,278
search of the definition of land race

320
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,440
and you'll find out the first thing it

321
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,360
says is it's a domestic breed also

322
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,759
honestly

323
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,440
important that like you're friends with

324
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,159
Rob Clark right so your definition are

325
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,199
bounced off Rob Clark the god of Canabis

326
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,399
genetics so like I'm going to go with

327
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:10,679
what you're going to say more than what

328
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,600
I'm going to read just about anywhere

329
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,120
else okay so here's here's another thing

330
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,639
and I don't want to get in like pissing

331
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,320
matches with people who say oh no it's

332
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,360
it's wild cannabis and such so I just

333
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,399
went luckily I'm very fortunate and

334
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,600
honored to have um uh developed a bit of

335
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,519
a relation with uh Rob Clark and he came

336
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,159
out and visited he's been out to our

337
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,720
farm now uh three times um just no

338
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:41,759
particular agenda we just like hanging

339
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,519
out you know we got 300 land race

340
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,759
varieties all growing in the same Garden

341
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,440
so it's kind of just sort of

342
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,600
Wonderland uh for folks it's a cannabis

343
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,040
amusement park is what it is it really

344
00:14:51,600 --> 00:15:00,440
it's Stoner Fantasy Land um and it's

345
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:05,439
just so anyway he was kind enough to

346
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:08,000
also uh send an email with his uh takes

347
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:12,800
on these these definitions just to clear

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,120
things up and uh and yeah I'll if if

349
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,679
okay not to be super boring I'll just

350
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,839
read a few sentences from from his

351
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,239
actual email I hope this he said it's

352
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,560
okay to share this but yeah sure so long

353
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
as they're not too long well go ahead

354
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:28,879
and no no no but right off the bat land

355
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,159
Rises are essentially locally adapted PL

356
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:34,759
and animal varieties that in that evolve

357
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:38,318
in response to Natural environmental

358
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:41,079
selective pressures in tandem with

359
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:44,278
simple human selection for favorable

360
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:48,239
characteristics without formal

361
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:50,360
breeding so um it says all domestic

362
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,959
plants and animals originated from Wild

363
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,079
po populations evolving naturally once

364
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,958
humans entered the scene the first steps

365
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:03,519
towards land race Evolution began so so

366
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:07,318
there you go so it's not it's not a uh

367
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,440
just keeping one line of of breeding a

368
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:13,519
particular genetic for just you know

369
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,920
like that ultimate um seed or clone uh

370
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,679
it's not a narrow breeding project it's

371
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:23,599
a it's a big large wide sort of

372
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:26,239
open pollination usually type breeding

373
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,079
project but then selecting most likely

374
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
what would happen is then you go and

375
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,198
select the seeds from the plants that

376
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,198
finished the best out of let's say a

377
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,559
whole patch like a large field of

378
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:40,278
cannabis and then uh the ones that made

379
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,318
it to the finish line and then when you

380
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:46,000
sample them they're awesome and you go

381
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:48,919
ah I want to grow the seeds from this

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,679
plant next year so that that way the

383
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,679
human is

384
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,958
now very much influencing and selecting

385
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,159
for their traits so that that is the

386
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,119
land race and then the other part that's

387
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:05,838
really important is

388
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,640
uh is that they're unique to that region

389
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,599
because now they've been isolated in

390
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,799
that physical geographic region for so

391
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,719
long that they're now like totally

392
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:18,480
unique compared to uh you know land

393
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,959
races in other parts of the world right

394
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,838
on so so we've established land race

395
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,480
good let's move forward a little bit now

396
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:28,678
are are wild and feral synonymous or are

397
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,120
those individual ideas too uh no we're g

398
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:36,120
if as far as running the analogy the dog

399
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:38,879
analogy uh what what feral is is its

400
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:43,839
domestic cannabis that has escaped the

401
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,760
farm and now it's off growing wild but

402
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,000
it's not actually the true wild original

403
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:52,038
cannabis variety so it's like Post Farm

404
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,679
wild yeah so this would be like uh in

405
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:56,158
Australia if we're doing our dog analogy

406
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,360
here this would be the

407
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,240
dingo right so the dingo

408
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,599
were in a domestic dog that was

409
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,558
introduced into Australia I think like

410
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,678
4,000 years ago or so and then it went

411
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,038
totally feral now it's actually part of

412
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,798
the

413
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:18,519
ecosystem in Australia but it was never

414
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,720
actually a wild naturally occurring wolf

415
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,400
um it was it was actually it was never

416
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,519
indigenous it was brought in correct and

417
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,720
it was a domestic dog that then went uh

418
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,079
feral and now is part of that

419
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,400
environment so cannabis is very

420
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,918
adaptable and such so if it escapes the

421
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,919
farm and by the way in the midwest in

422
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:43,038
the US we still have uh ditch weed

423
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,919
that's escaped hemp from the hemp Farms

424
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,960
you know of the early

425
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,919
1900s and so that's still growing but

426
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,640
when when a plant goes

427
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:57,559
feral it's now doesn't have that human

428
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,600
uh infusion or intention going on with

429
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:03,200
it so now it's now it's just the plant

430
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:06,678
doing its thing with its only motivation

431
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,000
is to keep making more seed so most

432
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:12,798
likely when you have feral

433
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
populations um The Taste the potency of

434
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:18,319
THC or whatever canabo you're going for

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,599
is the you know the plant doesn't even

436
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,639
care about that it just wants to make

437
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:25,879
seeds so now you're going to get you

438
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,240
know a hardier more adaptive for

439
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,679
survival and

440
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,519
reproducing plant for the cannabis plant

441
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,600
but uh probably the desirable human

442
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,839
traits are going to start fading on

443
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,399
those feral

444
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,439
populations um right on I I identify

445
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,880
with feral I think I'm falling further

446
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:50,320
and further out of normative society as

447
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,799
well yeah so um yeah exactly so if if

448
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:56,240
you went full Off the Grid and uh went

449
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,759
and lived in a hut or a cave out in the

450
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,679
middle of night and started raising a

451
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,200
family and such like that yeah you that

452
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,159
would be the full Embrace of it you'd be

453
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,640
then more adapted for hunting and

454
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,480
Gathering and not uh sitting Compu

455
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,400
social media all right so let's contract

456
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,079
contrast then that to Wild which would

457
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,320
be the which would probably be a plant

458
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:21,439
that is uh indigenous to that biosphere

459
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:25,839
but has never been domesticated and

460
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,360
farmed exactly and the thing is is most

461
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:31,558
likely so and again this is uh from

462
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:34,879
Robert Clark who also has uh sort of

463
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:37,319
combined all of the Cannabis research uh

464
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,880
he's got a great book

465
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,720
um I think it's called ethnobotany

466
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:47,120
cannabis ethnobotany uh that yeah it

467
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,038
goes in actually it's very information

468
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,639
dense so yeah it's a heavy duty read

469
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:55,960
yeah yeah it's not just a casual sit by

470
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,038
the fire kind of thing uh but it is a

471
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:02,079
really really really a great re source

472
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,279
for going and and what they've done is

473
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,199
just tracked and basically agree with

474
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,918
all these other um botanists and

475
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,880
scientists and ethnobotanists who've

476
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:15,278
tracked the original origin of cannabis

477
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:20,880
seems to come from what's now

478
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:25,000
geographically in China uh and that is

479
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,120
where the original wild cannabis seem to

480
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,599
originate

481
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:33,639
from but because cannabis domestic

482
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:38,639
cannabis was cultivated and used for

483
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,759
10,000 plus years in that same area it's

484
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,679
highly

485
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:47,079
unlikely that the original wild cannabis

486
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:50,600
didn't get crossed with domestic

487
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:53,960
cannabis at some point so to

488
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:58,240
differentiate the true wild origin

489
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:01,759
cannabis from uh feral domestic can can

490
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,759
abis uh it it's kind of almost

491
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,720
impossible to do that and most likely uh

492
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:10,879
it went extinct through hybridization

493
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,519
with other uh domestic varieties over

494
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,760
the past 10,000 years so so most likely

495
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:20,079
the original wild cannabis no longer

496
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,839
exists all right so then the cap off

497
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,839
this line of definitions why don't we

498
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,079
finish off with poly hybrid and then

499
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,720
we'll start talking about morphology

500
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:31,678
okay and then one other one that's part

501
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:36,519
of is also heirloom or Heritage

502
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:39,440
varieties good so and that's more

503
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:42,960
uh those would be specific breeding

504
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,759
projects a lot of times sort of like uh

505
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,038
we've got it going on in California

506
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,960
especially up in Humble and mesino and

507
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:54,158
such um actually was just reading about

508
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,640
some of these uh the Huckleberry Hill

509
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,320
Farms by the way I got this sample some

510
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,600
of their uh White white Thorn

511
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:04,119
Rose uh which I guess is getting a lot

512
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:08,199
of attention right now and that was that

513
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:10,719
is the only like cannabis from a

514
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,000
dispensary uh that I've sampled in the

515
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,440
last few years that was like wow that's

516
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,400
really that took me back to like

517
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:22,120
Grateful Dead parking lot kind

518
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,400
bud old school really really really

519
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:30,319
beautiful cannabis so um but I looked

520
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:33,759
into their story and such and I think a

521
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:37,319
lot somewh in that lineage he calls it

522
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:40,000
uh like Mom's weed so that would be like

523
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:43,399
heirlooms where families actually have

524
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,880
worked and developed their own you know

525
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,200
strain and pass that down through the

526
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,760
generations to like family and friends

527
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,840
and such like that so that's like an

528
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,200
heirloom right there where it's where

529
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,079
it's being passed through that just

530
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,880
warms my heart just even thinking about

531
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,960
looking at the at the genetic line and

532
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,039
and seeing mom's weed like that is the

533
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,480
heart of cannabis and like the human

534
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:09,440
relationship with the plant right when

535
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,558
it's like it's like pre the names pre

536
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,159
the the you know categories for sale and

537
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:19,119
and pre competition between people it's

538
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,159
just yeah this was this was our family's

539
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:24,519
particular strain that we loved and we

540
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,919
had at our holidays yeah I think I think

541
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,558
that's a beautiful thing so all right so

542
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,399
mom's with heirloom so that's kind of

543
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,000
more like heirloom where it's being

544
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:34,038
passed you know just like heirloom

545
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,038
furniture and such you're passing it

546
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:41,720
through generations and then uh but then

547
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:45,278
Heritage strains would follow that same

548
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,640
uh pattern or sort of be in that same

549
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:52,000
category only that might be more widely

550
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,520
uh distributed so and a lot of times uh

551
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,079
Heritage or or heirlooms exist only in

552
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,798
uh clone cuting form I mean they may

553
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:05,240
back them up with seeds but a lot of

554
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:10,599
times things you know like train wreck

555
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,759
AK-47 uh old school even even I guess

556
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,398
like old school Super Silver Haze

557
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,158
Northern Lights and things like that

558
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:18,599
those are more like the

559
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:25,200
Heritage like original

560
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:28,240
Foundation uh strains that uh did get uh

561
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,640
passed passed around uh through the

562
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,159
Community um so done so let's let's go

563
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,520
back to the poly hybrid then and then

564
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:42,159
cap off with that so now poly hybrids

565
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:45,278
and there's nothing wrong or unethical

566
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,559
or things to be snoody about

567
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:51,919
with poly hybrids it's just now what

568
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:54,079
seems to be gone and this isn't just I

569
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,200
mean this is my personal opinion but a

570
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,519
lot of other folks um are coming to the

571
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,840
same

572
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,119
inclusion is and if we're going to do

573
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:08,398
our dog breeding analogy

574
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:11,359
again uh most of the modern cannabis

575
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:15,079
that's now on the

576
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:19,759
scene is like the

577
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:23,359
Labradoodle times 10 so now you've got

578
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:27,119
labradoodles cross to pug dooodle or

579
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:31,119
puggles back to a pitbull back to a lab

580
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:34,398
dooodle back to a Cocker span of doodle

581
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:38,759
and it's all this and and it almost

582
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:41,359
doesn't even have any um necessarily any

583
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:44,158
intention for like oh I want to create

584
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:47,678
like a really racy High

585
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,039
creative uh variety that tastes like

586
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:54,080
passion fruit you know what I mean it's

587
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:56,798
more okay gelato was hot last month and

588
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,038
wedding cake is hot right now so we're

589
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:02,558
going to cross those those two and call

590
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,558
this gelato cake it yeah it just just on

591
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,480
its face it sounds less reputable

592
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,639
because you're you're breeding for

593
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,919
marketing hype instead of breeding to go

594
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,880
back to your dog example breeding for

595
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,600
the dog that take can take care of the

596
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,440
sheep and feed itself in the wild right

597
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:21,759
like one has authentic human cultural

598
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,120
meaning and the other one is for

599
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:28,839
capitalism and it's just yeah it's like

600
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:32,839
top 40 hits like these just very

601
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,158
just riding hype for the next 30 60 days

602
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:38,359
and it it's almost like if people were

603
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,360
hanging outside uh like a dog show you

604
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:42,839
know like a breeders I don't know these

605
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:47,278
Kennel Club dog shows yeah and they're

606
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:49,720
like oh your dog won the best in Terrier

607
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,359
class and yours won the best in this so

608
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,038
how about we just cross them together

609
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,359
and so now we have a doberman snower or

610
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,919
whatever yeah exactly and it's like the

611
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,278
hot new dog that's going to win the next

612
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,600
year's Kennel Club you know and then you

613
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:05,319
just do that exponentially into and

614
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,678
that's where we're at now we have like

615
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,119
all these whoever wanton all the cups or

616
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:13,278
whatever is getting attention then you

617
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:17,359
just cross all that stuff together and

618
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:22,519
it's just become this muddled muddled

619
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:25,519
muddled uh genetics and the effects um

620
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:28,240
it's I mean it's not just me saying this

621
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,399
I heard this confirmed and uh there's a

622
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,919
lot of consensus seems to be going on in

623
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:37,479
the community at this point that you

624
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:41,640
can't really tell the difference between

625
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:44,759
smoking runs or wedding cake or Oreos or

626
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,840
peanut butter cookie breath or whatever

627
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:51,278
it's like it all

628
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:53,639
basically kind of tastes looks and all

629
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,960
kind of feels the same and unfortunately

630
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,000
it's not

631
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,798
um I mean everyone has different you

632
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,519
know objectives and such with with their

633
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:08,038
Stoner ISM and what they're going for

634
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:12,120
and such but a lot of

635
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:15,839
people uh like that up like a creative

636
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:18,079
uplifting inspiring clear head and such

637
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:23,278
and and feeling active and kind of

638
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:26,319
amplifying life where now a lot of the

639
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:29,679
uh cannabis varieties right now seem to

640
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:33,480
be more of like an opiate

641
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,200
sedative uh kind of lethargic tired well

642
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,278
it's that it's that it's that miring

643
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,038
dominance that's all through the modern

644
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,038
commercial strains

645
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,960
right and so it's just

646
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:47,480
uh yeah so and to each their own it's

647
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,399
not to be S I mean there's a time and

648
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:55,640
place for couch lock and such but

649
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:58,038
uh but yeah if if every cannabis variety

650
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,240
now that you find out just dispensary

651
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:03,919
gives you that same couch lock I forgot

652
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,200
my name I'm just going to sit in my

653
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,159
underwear and play video games and eat

654
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,840
pizza if that's this the same effect

655
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,559
you've you've now it's kind of like all

656
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:16,079
all the vast world of all these

657
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,278
different dog breeds with all these

658
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:21,158
different personalities and fun

659
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:24,440
characteristics have now all been sort

660
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,679
of hybridized and homogenized into this

661
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,440
just

662
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:33,278
BL same exact uniform kind of

663
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,840
boring effect and you know you know it's

664
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:39,599
it's not to the fault of the modern

665
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:42,678
cannabis consumer or Enthusiast either

666
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,519
right because you know the vast majority

667
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:48,919
like 99% of what's available is the

668
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,359
modern poly hybrid stuff and you know

669
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:55,399
I've been I've been a cannabis

670
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:58,519
Enthusiast for gez 30 35 40 years now

671
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:03,558
something like that and um you know and

672
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:05,960
and it wasn't until um I came across um

673
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:06,839
my buddy shared with me some cuttings of

674
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,360
an

675
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:13,278
authentic um aapco gold and I'm like oh

676
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,158
this is what all those people who were

677
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,440
10 years older than me were talking

678
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,559
about about cuz the high was so entirely

679
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,880
different and then and then I decided

680
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:24,038
I'm like well I can't grow that here

681
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,278
where I live outside and so I was I was

682
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:30,519
able to get some oh actually he's from

683
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:31,960
your area uh Eric Miner of HBK genetics

684
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,200
um he he used to live in the in the

685
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,679
Santa Cruz region um he he's got this 20

686
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,679
weak black Colombian land race that I

687
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,278
grew indoors and like those two plants

688
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,840
are unlike everything else that I have

689
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:49,359
smoked and and have grown just because

690
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:51,759
and and so you know when when when you

691
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,278
when you say that okay the you know your

692
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,879
your your pound cake tastes like your

693
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,720
cookies Tes tastes like your this you're

694
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,360
that right it's because the mod

695
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:04,120
commercial cannabis is pulling from this

696
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:07,278
very small pool of of of commercially

697
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:09,839
viable genetics whereas you know if

698
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:12,960
those same people were able to get

699
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:16,000
access to you know you know equatorial

700
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,519
plants and Thai and Colombia and all

701
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,119
these and then and then smoke them

702
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,440
against each other well suddenly their

703
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,599
taste pet has expanded and now they see

704
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,759
they that they they see that they've

705
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,599
been looking down right at this

706
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,960
particular genetic pool

707
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:35,519
but not the not the global genetic

708
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:39,480
pool exactly and um so a lot of times

709
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:44,638
when when I break out uh yeah like an

710
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:48,599
aapco or a Thai variety or uh just right

711
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:51,278
now loving some stuff from Sri Lanka and

712
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:54,199
by the way a lot of these land races

713
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:58,359
that were growing um are seeds that were

714
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:02,000
sourced back in the 70s so it's it's not

715
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,678
even so you're geographically traveling

716
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,638
and culturally traveling but you're also

717
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:12,320
time traveling I like that yeah so

718
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:15,000
there's this myth that now the weed uh

719
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,359
uh today is stronger and

720
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,759
better but once you

721
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:25,599
sample like a 1970s Pakistan or 1970s

722
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:28,200
Sri Lankan or some of these old you know

723
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,398
people who went on the hippie tra or

724
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,960
worked at the Peace Corp in some of

725
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:37,158
these areas and brought back seeds uh

726
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,600
you know from almost 50 years

727
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:43,080
ago and then you grow them out and smoke

728
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:45,759
them and you're like oh my God that yeah

729
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:48,278
the weed was incredibly psychedelic back

730
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,558
then incredibly it's like a whole

731
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:54,200
different category it's almost verging

732
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:56,960
on psilocybin like you know like a low

733
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,159
dose of mushrooms and a lot of the lot

734
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,360
lot of the modern you know enthusiasts

735
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,320
they haven't had that opportunity and

736
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,158
and so they're just all like oh but the

737
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:08,559
the percentage THC on those older

738
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,559
strains were so low and and now I've got

739
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,159
this thing that somehow is over 30 and

740
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:15,279
you know and like it's so much better

741
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,720
but but a lot of these smokers don't

742
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,919
understand the important role that um

743
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:23,319
prevalent Tes placed in those older

744
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:26,078
strains in these untouched strains that

745
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,399
you know they might be 12 or 18% but

746
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,240
their tarpine percentage is so high and

747
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:34,918
that's what sculpts the high the the

748
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:36,439
experience that you have and and and

749
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,440
that's where the real difference comes

750
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,960
from we're not it's not about the THC

751
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,000
it's about the whole bouquet so that's

752
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,760
what's going it's like the symphony

753
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,679
orchestra

754
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,320
so yeah you have the bassoons and the

755
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,398
tonies and you have the cellos and you

756
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,440
French horns going on and things they

757
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:59,199
don't play a major role but they add so

758
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,480
much texture and Counterpoint and

759
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,399
diversity within the sound that there's

760
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,760
this whole communication going on but

761
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,720
now what seems to be going on with if

762
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,119
there's only so much real estate on the

763
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:17,399
cannabis plant so if you're up at 30 35%

764
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,160
THC that's kind of like the symphony

765
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,639
orchestra there's only so much stage so

766
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,679
that means you have to kick out all the

767
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:29,519
other instruments to make way for now

768
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:32,159
you have 200 violin players all playing

769
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,838
the exact same note yeah that's a good

770
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,399
one yeah and it's just playing the exact

771
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:39,838
same Melody and it's

772
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,960
still you know you it's still music not

773
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,799
as complex yeah you've just lost all

774
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,400
that complexity and now it's more of a

775
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,079
onedimensional

776
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,480
buzz experience without instead of this

777
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,880
big

778
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,400
Symphony tapestry of textures and

779
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,240
counterpoints and poly rhythms such like

780
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:05,119
that so it's yeah that's kind

781
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:07,519
of one analogy and you could even go

782
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,280
like Grateful Dead Jerry Garcia style I

783
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,480
mean let's not let's not go that let's

784
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,200
not go there we only have so much show

785
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,599
and you and I are both dead heads and

786
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,039
that will be the rest of the show so so

787
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,760
I actually want to move forward off of

788
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:22,440
the definitions and um because we we're

789
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,200
coming up on a commercial not too far

790
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,400
from now but I want to get some of these

791
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:29,879
other ideas in here that um you know

792
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,838
sometimes let's let's let's take a that

793
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,720
black Colombian I mentioned earlier as

794
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:39,159
an example okay so um you know um we

795
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:42,799
meaning cannabis cultivators that are

796
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:47,759
growing now we will get something like a

797
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:51,200
a a a Colombian or or or a a Syrian or

798
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,280
you know wherever this particular um

799
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:57,199
land race has come from and and people

800
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:00,680
treat it like that is

801
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:03,919
um not just an example but that is the

802
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:09,440
type of plant that everybody

803
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:13,000
in you know um Colombia or Sri Lanka you

804
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,920
mentioned earlier as if one that one um

805
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,639
plant is the only plant that is grown

806
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,960
there and and um and and I just like to

807
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,199
to talk to that idea because I think

808
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,280
that that is a real common misnomer in

809
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:30,799
the cannabis world that just because

810
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,319
you've had one plant from you know a

811
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,839
growing region that you've had what they

812
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,480
have to offer you know and and I I just

813
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:41,679
really feel like that that's probably

814
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:45,639
not true yeah that's so that's not

815
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:49,199
reality and all you have to do is go to

816
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:51,318
mesino or go to Big Sir even go back in

817
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,039
in time you know 50 years ago when

818
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:55,639
things were you know more on the down

819
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,400
low but was every single family and

820
00:37:55,639 --> 00:38:01,559
every single grower growing the exact

821
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:05,039
same genetics and the answerers no it's

822
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:06,559
and it's not in Sri Lanka or Afghanistan

823
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,440
there's not like

824
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:12,440
a cannabis club where they all vote on

825
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,720
what genetics every single cannabis

826
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,039
which one is going to be the official

827
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,679
genetic of their growing region yeah no

828
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:19,199
they're all they're all doing their own

829
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,639
thing but they're

830
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:25,159
also G of well one they probably you

831
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,559
know are sourcing their genetics from

832
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:29,960
similar Gene pools just because the

833
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:33,960
world hasn't been globalized for all

834
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,960
that long you know um so limited you

835
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,358
know genetic resources they're they're

836
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,960
going to pull from things they have in

837
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:43,159
the area uh but then they're also you

838
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,880
know going to also uh select for things

839
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:49,199
that do well in that same region so

840
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,960
you're going to have similarities but

841
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,239
are they all going to be exact carbon

842
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,800
copies of each other um and the answer

843
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:57,799
is absolutely not it kind of reminds me

844
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,839
of your huckleberry Hill example from

845
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,519
earlier where back in the genetic line

846
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,199
is mom's favorite like you know in Sri

847
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:06,000
Lanka it's not they're just producing

848
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:08,799
one kind all these different families

849
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,199
have got their mom's favorite and so you

850
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,560
know they've got just as much diversity

851
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:17,199
as as we're experiencing now um it's

852
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:20,119
just that um seeds are so hard to get

853
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:22,679
from these areas that you know one

854
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,680
variety makes its way out and then and

855
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:26,639
then unfortunately becomes the example

856
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:29,799
for the whole region cuz that's only

857
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,960
were able to get yeah but they they will

858
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,240
be similar though um I mean what's

859
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,400
happening now though in Thailand is all

860
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:40,159
the Amsterdam and Cali genetics are

861
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,760
coming in um and polluting their land

862
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,279
races uh that's that's the really scary

863
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,200
thing that's a whole another topic of

864
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,839
discussion but we may be experiencing a

865
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,960
global land race Extinction due to uh

866
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:57,078
hybridization it's basically like if you

867
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,559
know if you let labber dooodle out to

868
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:03,119
roam free and they went and basically

869
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,880
copulated with every dog breed on the

870
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,880
planet now everything's been

871
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,400
doodled and by the way I don't have

872
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,079
anything against doodle I actually have

873
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,760
a schnoodle a snower poodle uh mixed dog

874
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,880
so they're it makes your point though

875
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,560
what I'm saying is do we want to live in

876
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,160
a world where every dog breed has been

877
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:27,159
dualized yeah and uh and every can

878
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:30,318
cannabis has been cookie cake

879
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:32,920
you know um well hey I don't think I

880
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:36,559
don't think I'm going to top uh don't

881
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,519
doodle your cannabis um anywhere anymore

882
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,440
in this uh in in this first set so let's

883
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:42,679
uh let's let's end there and go for

884
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,639
commercial break and when we come back

885
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:47,639
we're going to start talking about uh uh

886
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,920
tpine profiles in land races so um let's

887
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:51,440
go ahead let's go ahead and take yeah

888
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,440
yeah yeah can I say one other tiny tiny

889
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,200
little thing about the land race and

890
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,159
that whole uh wild uh sort of feral

891
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,358
definition and such and this is a really

892
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:05,239
important thing for sort of Ethics

893
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:08,199
morals of of land races

894
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:12,358
so the definition that some folks have

895
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:14,279
worked on the wrong definition that uh

896
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:16,960
land races are just kind of wild and

897
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,680
feral and growing on the side of the

898
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:26,679
road also sets up a situation of

899
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:30,199
appropriation and complete erasing of

900
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:32,279
the farmer who developed the land race

901
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,399
variety you get what I'm saying yeah I

902
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,400
do so here maybe in the US if you all a

903
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,838
sudden have some really cool uh Thai

904
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,680
variety you're if you're totally

905
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:48,599
discounting that this is probably

906
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:52,159
hundreds of years of genetic work by

907
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,559
actual humans in Thailand in whatever

908
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:58,440
region or Village who created this like

909
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,920
totally Sublime variety if if you think

910
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,240
that it was just growing on the side of

911
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,039
the road wild all of a sudden there's no

912
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:09,879
credit there's no honor there's no

913
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:11,440
respect for uh those farmers and then

914
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,680
you're more apt to just name it

915
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,760
something or even call it your weed and

916
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:20,879
you've just erased uh the the human uh

917
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,520
work that actually got that strain to

918
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,480
that Sublime uh state so it's just

919
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:30,039
really important for land race to also

920
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:34,639
fully Cate at these amazing cannabis

921
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:38,119
intuitive breeders who uh develop these

922
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:40,759
like absolutely Sublime uh varieties uh

923
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:43,960
so a lot of human work went in to get

924
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,960
them to this point um and just because

925
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,199
you took a vacation to Thailand brought

926
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,440
back some seeds doesn't mean you created

927
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,960
that strain man that's a really good

928
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,800
point and I'm glad that I'm glad that

929
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,920
you held me up to put that in there so

930
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,760
all right thank you all right so so now

931
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,400
let's go to commercial uh we're going to

932
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,440
take that short break and be right back

933
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,480
you're listening to shaping fire and my

934
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,318
guest today is land race specialist Jeff

935
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,199
nordal and you know without these

936
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,920
advertisers shaping fire would not

937
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:12,639
happen so please support them and let

938
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,200
them know that you heard them on shaping

939
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,639
[Music]

940
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:19,318
fire one of the reasons why no till

941
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,358
cannabis growing is so valued by Farmers

942
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:23,480
is because the melium networks in the

943
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,880
soil remain established from year to

944
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,679
year and we know these fungal networks

945
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,079
are essential because they are the

946
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,318
nutrient super highways that extend far

947
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,920
and wide in the substrate to feed your

948
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,719
plants the trouble with growing in New

949
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,599
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

950
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,439
is that it takes most of the plant's

951
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,680
life just to create these mycelium

952
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,119
highways dinico endom micral fungi

953
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,118
inoculant reduces that time and gets

954
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,559
your plant eating a wider array of

955
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:54,680
nutrients faster and it's three times

956
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,599
the concentration of the other popular

957
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:59,919
brand in the US at 900 propagules per

958
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,760
gram of two fungal species selected

959
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,800

967
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,280
love using dyom myo to both speed up the

968
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,000
growth of the melium networks in the

hours of daylight instead of the typical

14 1/2 hours of daylight that means in

most regions your plants will start to

flower outdoors in the middle of July

instead of the middle of August which

1054

means these photo period plants finish

shaping fire I am your host Shango Los

1086
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:22,239
and my guest today is land red

1087
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,240
specialist Jeff nordle so in the first

1088
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:27,239
set we talked a lot about what exactly

1089
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:30,479
land races are and how to understand

1090
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:33,159
them from different varieties of plants

1091
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,280
that may have come into this modern

1092
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:37,358
world in different ways so that we can

1093
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,440
really be precise in what we're talking

1094
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,279
about since we are talking about a

1095
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,318
scientific term so that was really great

1096
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,880
teasing those terms apart generally um

1097
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:47,920
but now here in the second set I want to

1098
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,519
talk about um a little bit about the

1099
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,159
characteristics of these plants and and

1100
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:57,318
and why we generally all tend to respect

1101
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:59,838
them and why Jeff has you know uh Focus

1102
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:02,000
so much of his life on it so so Jeff you

1103
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:04,679
know in your videos on your YouTube

1104
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,280
channel you are U constantly talking

1105
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:11,598
about just being like like bowled over

1106
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,960
by the complexities of um the tpine

1107
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,798
profiles and and during the first set we

1108
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,760
also talked a little trash about like

1109
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:21,358
modern poly hybrids and and about how so

1110
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,960
many of them are massively miring

1111
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:27,558
dominant um but but I want to tease out

1112
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,639
a little bit more um about uh about the

1113
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:34,240
experiences that you've had in your

1114
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:36,118
garden um with Unique Blends of tpine

1115
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,399
profiles and and like you know you don't

1116
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,920
have clearly you're not going to talk

1117
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,960
about all 300 that you're growing but if

1118
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,639
if I want to provide the listeners with

1119
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,280
a snapshot of some of the experiences

1120
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:51,639
you've had so so maybe just like pick

1121
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,760
like three that were especially unique

1122
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:57,719
to you and and describe them to us so

1123
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:01,760
that we can smell it through you all

1124
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:04,358
right as far as top three standout

1125
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,680
turpan profiles from this year's garden

1126
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:08,719
and again every year we're doing

1127
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:10,879
different varieties from around the

1128
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,798
world uh but the ones that are Super

1129
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:18,079
Fresh in my mind are

1130
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:20,679
uh the Cambodian two varieties of

1131
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:24,359
Cambodian had the most

1132
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:26,159
insane passion fruit like just that

1133
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:30,719
Tangy

1134
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:33,838
jippy sour super tropical loud loud loud

1135
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:37,239
passion fruit and I actually uh went and

1136
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:39,440
got an actual passion fruit fruit

1137
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:43,039
sniffed that and then sniffed one of

1138
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:46,039
these uh mandul Kiri and then also too

1139
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,440
another region uh in Cambodia they

1140
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:51,679
smelled exactly the same the actual

1141
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:54,519
passion fruit and uh the Cannabis uh at

1142
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,159
least those varieties of Cambodian so

1143
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:59,440
that was pretty pretty

1144
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:03,480
mindblowing um another turpine profile

1145
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:07,639
that uh you rarely come across in sort

1146
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:10,240
of the uh modern uh poly hybrid genetics

1147
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:11,879
but uh which I'm a huge fan of are the

1148
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:16,519
really

1149
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:21,358
stinky skunky rotten meat burnt rubber

1150
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:23,759
rotten onions just super Funk um and a

1151
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:27,078
lot of times you'll find those in the

1152
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,640
Afghan uh pack istani uh we actually

1153
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:30,240
grew some

1154
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:34,440
USC

1155
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:38,279
um varieties this year um and and one of

1156
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:39,838
those smelled like rotten decomposing

1157
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,880
onions and

1158
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:46,679
garlic really really funky it's almost

1159
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,280
uh disgusting but at the same time

1160
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:53,199
intoxicating kind of like the uh truffle

1161
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,960
black truffle effect where it's gross

1162
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:58,358
but intoxicating well I I love those

1163
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,159
cheeses that smell and and smell like

1164
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:02,558
baby diaper you know like like if if it

1165
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:05,279
if that smell was coming out of a human

1166
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,240
I'd be like but suddenly now on a on a

1167
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,760
plate with crackers I'm like yeah this

1168
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:14,759
is awesome yeah yeah oh and by the way

1169
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:19,760
reminds me there's a really weird turum

1170
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:22,720
profile um that actually smells like uh

1171
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:25,280
like bounce dryer sheets wow like that

1172
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:27,598
really gnarly fabri and and by the way

1173
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,839
this is what's strange is I'm highly

1174
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,559
allergic to a lot of synthetic

1175
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:36,159
fragrances especially those uh laundry

1176
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:39,119
detergent smells so I just absolutely am

1177
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:41,679
repulsed whenever I smell that smell but

1178
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,280
then uh and I always said there is no

1179
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:45,759
smell in nature that smells like a

1180
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,798
bounce dryer sheet but I've actually

1181
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:52,280
grown some cannabis now that

1182
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:53,798
smells like bounc dryer sheets and it's

1183
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,559
kind of weird so who knows it may

1184
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:59,039
actually help me uh

1185
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:02,440
gets gets through my dryer sheet

1186
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:04,759
aversion by uh smelling it in cannabis

1187
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,760
form it is really strange when you smell

1188
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,200
something in cannabis that you also

1189
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,480
exists in the real world uh this example

1190
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:15,078
isn't as great as yours but you know

1191
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:17,679
there uh the blueberry muffin U variety

1192
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:20,318
from humbal Seed Company it's really

1193
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:23,960
startling how much it smells like the

1194
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:25,719
blueberry Jiffy cake mix which is which

1195
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,440
doesn't you know it kind of

1196
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:30,959
smells like blueberries that are natural

1197
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,358
right it it smells like itself but it

1198
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,480
was so strange to smell that variety and

1199
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:39,318
be all like oh my God like okay this

1200
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:43,960
smells blueberry but it smells like the

1201
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:45,519
muffin box and those muffins themselves

1202
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,880
which you know have got a little more of

1203
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,960
a a breakfast cereal vibe to them than

1204
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,760
like a natural organic Berry and it's

1205
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,679
it's a fantastic U you know variety I've

1206
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:58,280
I've grown it a long time and I love it

1207
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:01,480
and yet it smells like a cheap boxed

1208
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:07,839
muffin mix and it's just a bizarre thing

1209
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:12,760
it it is so wild the diversity of Aromas

1210
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:15,239
and turpins that this cannabis plant uh

1211
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,680
can carry and provide and that can just

1212
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:19,679
sort of emerge from these plant and then

1213
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,558
when you start Crossing plants to whole

1214
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:26,118
new combinations of it's it's pretty

1215
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:30,119
mindblowing I I'm not aware of other

1216
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:32,160
plants that have such a diversity of

1217
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,559
smells so I'm going to ask you one more

1218
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,038
tpine related question I don't want to

1219
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:37,119
spend too much time here because like

1220
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:39,319
you know not everybody can smell it

1221
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,838
together right so it's talking about

1222
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:43,639
tpin is is kind of challenging sometimes

1223
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,798
but the the last question I want to ask

1224
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:47,798
you about this is um tell us tell us

1225
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:50,960
about one plant that you smelled where

1226
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:54,000
you this the the the the taring profile

1227
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,760
of it was was a smell that you had never

1228
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,039
smelled before

1229
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,039
and it blew you away because you your

1230
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:01,160
brain wasn't sure what to do to it it'll

1231
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:03,039
probably be very hard for you to

1232
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:06,399
describe it to me because of that reason

1233
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:08,960
too yeah it's almost like uh seeing a

1234
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,440
color you've never seen before yeah and

1235
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,400
there's just yeah your your brain just

1236
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,960
can't even process that but yeah there's

1237
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,039
a number of uh varieties of cannabis

1238
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,240
that uh come across in these land race

1239
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,960
botanical gardens we do every year that

1240
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:28,199
have just

1241
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,720
it like scrambles your

1242
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:32,838
brain

1243
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:36,000
because you've never smelled

1244
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:38,199
anything like that and so you can't even

1245
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,280
find words to describe it because it's

1246
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:43,078
such a bizarre smell um so yeah that

1247
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,599
happens quite a bit and then you end up

1248
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:47,880
just sitting there sniffing it because

1249
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:50,240
it's it's intoxicating just to have that

1250
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,920
experience yeah so it's so engaging to

1251
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:53,879
have that first new experience we humans

1252
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,400
go for

1253
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,838
those

1254
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,920
absolutely oh oh did want to say the

1255
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,838
other really interesting turpine profile

1256
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,440
that you find in land races uh

1257
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:07,920
especially the African and Southeast

1258
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:12,798
Asian equatorial is there's this really

1259
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:18,039
interesting um carrot uh

1260
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:20,318
parsnip uh turp so it's and the reason

1261
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:22,760
how actually connected those dots was my

1262
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:25,199
girlfriend was actually peeling

1263
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,720
parsnips and the smell that came from

1264
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:31,598
those parsnips I was like oh that's that

1265
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:35,679
smell so it's that uh sort of antiseptic

1266
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:38,680
astringent really earthy sweet fresh

1267
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,719
fresh fresh carrot parsnip smell um but

1268
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:45,078
you'll actually see those in a lot of

1269
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:47,118
African uh varieties as well as uh Thai

1270
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,599
Chang Rai that we grew this year

1271
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,039
actually had that t profile uh and

1272
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,280
that's that's always a favorite too so

1273
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:55,480
while we're kind of going through your

1274
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,160
picture album if you will of of of

1275
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,199
plants that you love um we've just did

1276
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,279
tpin and I want to do a very similar

1277
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:04,558
thing but with morphology now right so

1278
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,319
how the plant looks its structure

1279
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,839
because um you know I love uh when you

1280
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:10,358
go through these different plants and

1281
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:11,960
I'm like wow these are all cannabis

1282
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:15,480
plants but they all have got so much

1283
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:18,480
different visual personality for example

1284
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:21,318
you recently post a video about one from

1285
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,159
um the island of St Vincent and and I

1286
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:25,679
saw it and I'm like now this is a plant

1287
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:28,519
that would work really well where I live

1288
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:32,078
because it doesn't grow big and bushy it

1289
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:33,880
kind of grows like it grows kind of like

1290
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,680
straight up and down like it's a pencil

1291
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,358
skirt or something and it's very

1292
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,118
respectful of its neighbors right you

1293
00:58:38,358 --> 00:58:42,558
can walk past it without it grabbing you

1294
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:44,519
like most plants do so so I guess kind

1295
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,319
of like you did with Tarpin maybe tell

1296
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:48,119
us like three of your favorite

1297
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,838
morphologies like tell us the story of

1298
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:53,920
like three plants that look

1299
00:58:50,838 --> 00:58:56,838
atypical um this and again I'm just

1300
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,358
going off this year every year there's

1301
00:58:56,838 --> 00:59:05,519
mindblowing uh structures and uh but

1302
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:08,798
this year a huge surprise was uh Brazil

1303
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:11,440
Amazonia so I was you know thinking that

1304
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:15,400
was going to be just a long lanky wispy

1305
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,440
tropical equatorial sativa type this

1306
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,559
actually turned out to

1307
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:25,400
be super

1308
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:28,400
short super squat bushy with big chunky

1309
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,480
thick buds it it grew and looked almost

1310
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:35,200
like an a typical indicia actually an

1311
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:40,559
even bushier stockier squater uh

1312
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:43,639
indicia uh but it has this wild um Pia

1313
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,920
colada turp profile going this tropical

1314
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:49,480
fruit and then uh when you finally get

1315
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:52,680
around to uh sampling it and smoking it

1316
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,280
it is super high electric almost like

1317
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:56,798
Brazil uh Carnival

1318
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,720
kind of

1319
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:04,838
vibe bright colors and feathers and

1320
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:07,639
electric and drum beats all in a very

1321
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:09,798
squat bushy actually early finishing

1322
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:11,038
these were all done uh by the end of

1323
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:16,559
September as

1324
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:20,319
well uh but super electric sativa Stone

1325
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:22,720
so uh that was that was a big surprise

1326
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:25,798
um and also like super bulletproof as

1327
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:28,439
far as pest resistance and and mold it's

1328
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:31,280
got all that land race Vigor still going

1329
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:34,000
oh yeah yeah yeah and that's that's one

1330
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,359
of the beautiful things too about these

1331
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,480
land races is they're just so they're so

1332
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:43,000
much heartier and designed to not be

1333
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:45,440
high maintenance plants um so so anyway

1334
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,599
they have yeah we don't even deal for

1335
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:53,720
the most part with btis haven't seen

1336
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:56,400
powdered Milo in 10 years wow um and Bug

1337
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:58,719
pressure is pretty low the aphids are

1338
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,760
still kind of a

1339
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,239
menace it's probably going to be around

1340
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,880
for quite some time they're kind of

1341
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:08,279
indestructible but um yeah so that's so

1342
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,000
anyway that that was one uh structure

1343
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,160
that was very surprising this year

1344
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
another yeah the St

1345
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:20,159
Vincent as uh you noticed uh even though

1346
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,119
we had unlimited root space so usually a

1347
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:25,038
cannabis plant when it has unlimited

1348
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:27,119
root space tends to

1349
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:29,160
the top of the plant will then become

1350
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,000
wide and bushy as well to mirror the

1351
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:36,719
root system uh but for whatever

1352
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,719
reason um the St Vincent just shot

1353
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:42,078
straight vertical and only was maybe a 4

1354
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:45,598
foot diameter plant where a lot of ours

1355
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,760
are like 8 to 10 foot diameter plants

1356
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,400
when grown in those conditions so uh for

1357
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,000
whatever reason it just really wanted to

1358
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,480
stay going vertical uh and it got

1359
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,920
probably 12 feet tall with just really

1360
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:04,000
nice uniform sort of calabra of uh

1361
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:06,519
uniform flowers going um have not

1362
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,079
sampled that one yet but

1363
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:12,000
uh had all the signs that it should be

1364
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,079
it should be a nice one yeah and and and

1365
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,760
it's special too I just like plants that

1366
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,359
that look different you know like like

1367
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,720
even these mut mutants that you see

1368
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,199
people put online like I like mutant

1369
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:22,838
plants too it's like people are like oh

1370
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:25,719
that should be destroyed kill it get it

1371
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:28,719
out of the Jean Pool and I'm like okay

1372
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:32,639
maybe all of that's true but also isn't

1373
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:36,639
it cool you know yeah and it may turn

1374
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:39,598
out to be a an advantageous adaption you

1375
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:43,159
know um that's kind of mutants

1376
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,160
Drive evolutionary change too so let's

1377
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:47,879
let's talk a little bit about how the

1378
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:50,318
morphology um responds to where these

1379
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,640
plants are from right because a lot of

1380
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:56,519
these plants that come your way these

1381
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:58,598
land Races they have themselves over you

1382
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:03,519
know hundreds or thousands of years have

1383
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:07,760
become hot or cold adapted for the areas

1384
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:09,798
that they are from and so um you know uh

1385
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,799
I'm very willing to be wrong cuz I have

1386
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:14,278
not come in a contact with as many land

1387
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:16,719
races as you have but generally speaking

1388
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:20,480
my impression is is that you know

1389
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:24,358
equatorial plants where it is um you

1390
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:28,440
know wet and hot they tend to be more

1391
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:32,558
open Airy flowers so that um you know

1392
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:34,599
they can uh more easily uh transpire and

1393
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:37,240
you know kind of respirate and breathe

1394
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:40,160
in the Heat and also so they dry out

1395
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:43,759
really quickly after you know a monsoon

1396
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:47,440
or something like that whereas so many

1397
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:50,400
of the the you know the the Pakistani

1398
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,039
and Afghani and you know things that are

1399
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,559
grown um you know

1400
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:58,520
near you know these these these cold

1401
01:03:55,559 --> 01:04:01,559
seasonal Mountain re regions they tend

1402
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:03,159
to have these like like tighter flowers

1403
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:05,240
and in my head it's always like oh so

1404
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:07,118
they cons conserve warmth and I don't

1405
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:09,278
know if that's true or not but but i'

1406
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,240
just like to to hear your thoughts after

1407
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:14,239
having interacted with so many of these

1408
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:17,159
plants how do you see these morphologies

1409
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:18,838
um you know uh being associated with the

1410
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:22,159
different parts of the world that they

1411
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:24,759
come from yeah yeah absolutely and there

1412
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:28,159
definitely is um

1413
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:33,319
yeah the equatorial tropical sativas for

1414
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:36,358
the most part yeah share that um larier

1415
01:04:33,318 --> 01:04:38,278
areer uh flower structure for that exact

1416
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:40,960
reason because they're in a extremely

1417
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:45,278
humid moist environment and they might

1418
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:48,318
even be getting rain quite often um so

1419
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:50,039
yeah yeah so if if it was a super

1420
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:52,599
compact dense

1421
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:54,960
flower they'd all

1422
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:59,000
implode you know with in the first week

1423
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:02,440
of flowering um due to btis uh they'd

1424
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,679
probably mold out very quickly so uh

1425
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:09,000
yeah kind of across the board um the

1426
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:12,879
equatorial sativas all have that looser

1427
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:16,318
Airy uh structure a lot of times uh very

1428
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,278
foxtail like Fox tailes upon Fox tailes

1429
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:19,838
almost like a

1430
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:23,480
romanesca

1431
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:26,639
uh kind of you know fractals of like Fox

1432
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:29,119
tales with fox tailes fox tail and uh

1433
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:32,920
but you'll find those are also Crystal

1434
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:35,559
coated so they may not be heavy but

1435
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,639
every nook and cranny is coated in

1436
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:40,119
Crystal so um so if you're just talking

1437
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:42,159
about straight resin yield they might

1438
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:44,039
actually end up being a bigger one a

1439
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:47,798
better choice even though they're open

1440
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:51,000
and Airy yeah yeah and um and that's

1441
01:05:47,798 --> 01:05:53,400
another really interesting thing about

1442
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,199
um but yeah so that's equatorial

1443
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,318
tropical equ tutorials you'll see that

1444
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:00,759
pretty much across the board but the

1445
01:05:57,318 --> 01:06:05,960
amazing thing is these plants just don't

1446
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:08,839
mold they just btis just does not happen

1447
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:10,798
unless uh the only thing that gets the

1448
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:16,159
like the Achilles heel of those tropical

1449
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:18,480
sativas is uh Frost so and as things

1450
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:23,639
start to get cold if you do get frost on

1451
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,679
those buds they tend to um die very

1452
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:27,639
quickly

1453
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:29,919
uh so that's uh so that's the only thing

1454
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:32,879
and even when they die a lot of times

1455
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,358
you won't get btis mold you'll just get

1456
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:40,240
dead spots um so they're just incredibly

1457
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:44,440
mold resistant um Now with uh like

1458
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:47,078
Afghan Pakistan Iranian those varieties

1459
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:51,079
it's not just hot and cold but those are

1460
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:55,519
also extremely Aid environments so very

1461
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:59,559
low humidity where uh btis just isn't as

1462
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:04,920
much of a threat in those regions so uh

1463
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:08,000
the human um uh intervention with those

1464
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,720
has has been to maximize yield so you

1465
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,079
get more yield with a chunkier heavier

1466
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:16,598
bud and if you can push it without btis

1467
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,880
you know there there you go uh the

1468
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:22,359
problem is when you

1469
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:25,240
bring a super dense chunk Afghan all of

1470
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:27,960
a sudden into Santa Cruz Coastal wet

1471
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:32,239
foggy environment that's just a recipe

1472
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:35,278
for uh btis explosions and that's and

1473
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:38,598
see that quite a lot of people have that

1474
01:07:35,278 --> 01:07:41,239
experience um we're fortunate where

1475
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:44,160
we're growing we're behind a mountain

1476
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:47,000
range so that catches the Marine layer

1477
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:51,239
so we're actually pretty Aid in our play

1478
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,880
so we can actually pull off these

1479
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:56,598
um uh Afghan Pakistani

1480
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,318
yeah it's pretty obvious from your

1481
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:00,559
Instagram that you live in a special

1482
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:01,880
Biore region because seeing all these

1483
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,200
different plants from all these

1484
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,920
different regions of the world all

1485
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:07,838
growing and finishing like I've I've

1486
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,039
sworn at my phone before I'm like how

1487
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:11,519
the hell is he growing this oh my God

1488
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:13,480
you know because like I live at the

1489
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,679
other end right I live Pacific Northwest

1490
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:19,520
on an island you know 50 feet from

1491
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:21,838
crashing water that's marine and salty

1492
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,839
right so like I live a terrible place to

1493
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:27,479
grow myself but where you are it's it's

1494
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:30,960
like you know best possible combination

1495
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:34,198
of attributes it's yeah and uh it's San

1496
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:38,759
Lorenzo Valley in Santa Cruz mountains

1497
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:42,559
has a long long uh cannabis history and

1498
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:47,119
it turns out it's a real nice uh little

1499
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:49,159
microclimate that uh yeah say it's it's

1500
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,640
blocked off from the Marine layer even

1501
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:54,798
though we're down in a valley uh so you

1502
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:58,159
don't necessarily have to be super high

1503
01:08:54,798 --> 01:09:01,000
elevation uh but uh but we're behind a

1504
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:03,000
mountain uh Empire Grade that actually

1505
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,560
catches that whole Marine layer so we

1506
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,759
just don't get that Coastal fog so uh

1507
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,798
anyway so so yeah so the next thing I

1508
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:12,399
want to talk about is the the unique

1509
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:13,838
cultivation demands of land race and

1510
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,960
that kind of fits in perfectly with the

1511
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:18,278
weather conversation that we're having

1512
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,039
because you know I'm sure lots of people

1513
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:22,359
who are listening like me are being

1514
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:24,960
inspired by what you're saying and we're

1515
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:26,798
all like I want to grow land race and

1516
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,679
and um

1517
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:32,679
uh have you you know from from growing

1518
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:37,440
so many year over a year um have you

1519
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:41,039
noticed any cultivation demands or best

1520
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,759
practices um for land races because you

1521
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:46,238
know I imagine to a certain degree they

1522
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:48,759
are finicky to us who are used to kind

1523
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:50,599
of growing all of the same plant because

1524
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:52,479
because these these these modern plants

1525
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:55,000
that we've talked about earlier are very

1526
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:57,359
similar to each other but but then

1527
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,039
you're growing all these weirdo plants

1528
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,039
which of course are land races and

1529
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:02,560
they're not weirdo but like they are if

1530
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:05,000
you're a cultivator who has never grown

1531
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,560
them before so so let's let's hear a

1532
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,960
little bit about that like I'm I'm sure

1533
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,120
that you have run into some unexpected

1534
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,640
growing needs that that some of these

1535
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:18,599
varieties have uh well here's here's the

1536
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:21,640
very good news about land R is

1537
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:25,440
um they're actually developed to be low

1538
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:28,199
maintenance plants we love hearing that

1539
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:31,678
so so a real finicky high maintenance

1540
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:33,839
like OG cush you know that

1541
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,840
uh you know it's going to have powder

1542
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,600
mil do and all this it not to get back

1543
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:42,279
into the dog thing but um but it's kind

1544
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,800
of like you don't have to worry about

1545
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:45,679
with the land race like the hip

1546
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,000
dysplasia and all this like kind of

1547
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:52,960
inbred problems with susceptibilities to

1548
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,439
disease and uh molds and and pathogens

1549
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,359
uh and it turns out out actually with

1550
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:59,799
the Hop blatant

1551
01:10:56,359 --> 01:11:02,719
vroid uh most land races I mean they can

1552
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:05,840
still get it but don't seem to be

1553
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:09,960
affected uh neg as negatively as some of

1554
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:12,920
these poly hybrids too uh so so it's

1555
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,840
actually yes all the land races and

1556
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:19,239
we're growing them from all around the

1557
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:21,159
world from totally different regions uh

1558
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:25,319
but because they're such

1559
01:11:21,158 --> 01:11:28,839
hearty uh plants that are designed to

1560
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:32,519
you know Thrive without a ton of human

1561
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:37,239
uh catering and pandering to the plant

1562
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:39,360
and pampering um they all do pretty they

1563
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:44,799
have a they all seem to have high

1564
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:48,519
tolerance to disease molds and pests um

1565
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:52,560
so I I actually think they're easier to

1566
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:55,880
grow than uh most of the modern poly

1567
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:59,639
hybrids that tend to have sort of

1568
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:01,719
genetic disease vulner yeah yeah they've

1569
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:04,679
they've actually yeah they've gone for

1570
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:06,840
potency and who cares about and and when

1571
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:08,960
people say oh it's a challenging strain

1572
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,560
or really finicky strain there's another

1573
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,279
way you could say

1574
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:16,760
is that's kind of crap genetics if you

1575
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:19,439
have a massively disease prone

1576
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:23,520
plant that might actually be kind of

1577
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:26,479
crappy genetics no one wants to yeah be

1578
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:29,280
growing unless you're doing some

1579
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:30,879
adoptive Foster thing for sickly plants

1580
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,599
or something why why would you want to

1581
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,480
grow plants that you have to spray

1582
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,120
chemicals all over all the time to fend

1583
01:12:35,479 --> 01:12:39,039
off diseases how about just getting

1584
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:42,079
genetics that naturally fend off

1585
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:44,920
diseases but do you do you find that um

1586
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:47,039
it takes some time with these varieties

1587
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,840
for you to figure out their like basic

1588
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:50,198
needs like I can imagine that these

1589
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,520
different plants from different places

1590
01:12:50,198 --> 01:12:54,319
have got like different water

1591
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,560
requirements and different uh you know

1592
01:12:54,319 --> 01:13:00,319
uh food amendments requirements actually

1593
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:03,760
not really and I and I can totally see

1594
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:06,880
where you might think that but uh here's

1595
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:09,719
here's how we grow

1596
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,600
uh we we don't actually really feed

1597
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:15,198
throughout the entire year so what we

1598
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,920
focus on and we uh grow in a hugle

1599
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:20,678
culture

1600
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:23,480
environment uh so so

1601
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:26,158
where and what we do is we build a

1602
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:30,238
really super nutrient

1603
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:33,719
dense Super Rich living soil in the off

1604
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:38,198
season and then by the time we plop that

1605
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:39,198
plant in that soil come uh uh June May

1606
01:13:38,198 --> 01:13:43,399
or

1607
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:46,799
June we don't actually feed those plants

1608
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:48,638
throughout the whole year um so it's

1609
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,880
what we're doing is we provide an all

1610
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:53,319
you can eat

1611
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:56,119
buffet of compost and organic nutrient

1612
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:59,639
nutrients that along with all the uh

1613
01:13:56,119 --> 01:14:03,359
breaking down forest debris uh sticks

1614
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:05,039
leaves uh chunks of logs and everything

1615
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:08,319
and so now you have all the

1616
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:12,158
melium that's just thriving in there so

1617
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:13,960
it's kind of like the plant um can pick

1618
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,960
and choose what it wants it's got an all

1619
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:20,760
you can eat buffet and everything's

1620
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:23,639
there at its root tips uh to absorb uh

1621
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:27,000
so that's that's how we actually grow we

1622
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:29,480
supercharge and get really living great

1623
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,520
powerful living soil uh in the beginning

1624
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:34,959
of the season and then the plants just

1625
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:38,840
kind of adapt to that so we're not at

1626
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:41,760
all running around going oh this these

1627
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:45,520
Brazilians need some phosphorus or this

1628
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:50,280
needs some magnesium like we don't do

1629
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:53,000
that at all um the only time is maybe

1630
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:56,840
some of these longer flowering plants

1631
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:01,600
that get super super huge uh may just

1632
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:03,239
need a little bit of uh nitrogen later

1633
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,480
in the year if they start if they've

1634
01:15:03,238 --> 01:15:09,079
gobbled up all the uh nitrogen a lot of

1635
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:12,799
times we'll do that with just a simple

1636
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:16,119
like fish Emulsion compost tea uh to

1637
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:18,639
just balance them out but but no there's

1638
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:21,800
these are not

1639
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:23,560
um yeah they they all basically they

1640
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,159
they're all growing in the exact same

1641
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:29,920
soil with the same nutrients same

1642
01:15:27,158 --> 01:15:31,079
watering and they kind of and they just

1643
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,079
kind of

1644
01:15:31,079 --> 01:15:36,158
adapt so when when you're new to a land

1645
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:39,519
race and you don't know whether or not

1646
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:42,319
it's going to be you know a 4 foot wide

1647
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:44,360
or a 10 foot wide plant do you just give

1648
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:48,079
all your plants the same amount of space

1649
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:50,960
and let them Express themselves or yeah

1650
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:53,800
yeah yeah and we're in a uh fixed we

1651
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:57,158
installed these hexagon

1652
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:59,400
uh shaped uh planter boxes uh in the

1653
01:15:57,158 --> 01:16:02,679
soil so so you're not moving your grid

1654
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:04,319
every year or anything it's like yeah so

1655
01:16:02,679 --> 01:16:07,359
and we gave them a lot of space because

1656
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:09,920
we designed the garden uh for humans to

1657
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:13,119
be wandering around this is not a row

1658
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:15,560
crop yielding industrial Garden by any

1659
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:18,920
means it's it's actually a Living Art

1660
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:20,000
Exhibit of uh cannabis genetics from

1661
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:23,560
around the

1662
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,639
world it's cool just growing but then

1663
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:31,320
that make it so much it just sounds like

1664
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:34,159
a pleasure Garden dude oh so so we we

1665
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:36,559
started this and we started having uh

1666
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:39,439
visitors out and it was just so much fun

1667
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:41,520
but this was preco and then covid hit

1668
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:44,359
and you know we've kind of taken a break

1669
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:47,000
from having visitors out uh and then the

1670
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:49,559
Hop Lon vroid had me really freaked out

1671
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,119
until now I I I have a much better

1672
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:55,440
understanding of the risk um and such

1673
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:58,079
and we're not in a high risk uh of

1674
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,599
humans visiting and like transmitting

1675
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:03,000
thank goodness so um but anyway yeah the

1676
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:07,000
garden's designed to actually for humans

1677
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,639
to wander around um where each box

1678
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,800
actually has plenty of space in between

1679
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:14,359
so you can actually if you're wandering

1680
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:16,400
around socializing smoking a joy and you

1681
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:18,920
resonate with a particular plant you can

1682
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:21,638
then walk all the way around the

1683
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:25,319
perimeter of that plant see it from all

1684
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:27,119
angles uh uh and and such so that's yeah

1685
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:30,158
we give the plants lots of space because

1686
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:33,960
we kind of see each one as like a a work

1687
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:38,039
of art uh and we want to give it its its

1688
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:39,679
space to do its thing good good so um

1689
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:41,279
how do you find that these and and like

1690
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:43,440
I I recognize that you're Outdoors so

1691
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:45,279
you may not have had done a lot of this

1692
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:47,319
but I bet you you still have an educated

1693
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:51,679
opinion on it like how how do these land

1694
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:53,599
races that have never um you know been

1695
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,239
cultivated by

1696
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,480
present Growers how do they respond to

1697
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:01,079
things like training and scrogging and

1698
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:06,079
like kind of like like human dominance

1699
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:08,600
we don't well that's exactly it like um

1700
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,960
philosophically I I don't see my

1701
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:13,679
relationship with the plant as where I'm

1702
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,399
trying to dominate and squeeze out and

1703
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:20,440
maximize and exploit every molecule of

1704
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:23,960
that plant to pump out more buds for me

1705
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:28,439
yeah right um so we we don't top

1706
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:31,000
we don't Leaf we don't train we we're

1707
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:33,919
just each one of these seeds is a

1708
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,198
mystery and we want to see what this

1709
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:40,480
plant's story is so we actually step

1710
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:44,238
back and just let the plant do its thing

1711
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:46,759
uh so we again we don't even Leaf these

1712
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:48,799
plants um and what what you'll find

1713
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,960
though when you let a plant just go

1714
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,880
natural you you kind of get a Christmas

1715
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,960
tree type shape

1716
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:58,199
and

1717
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:01,880
then it may be like hey how do but how

1718
01:18:58,198 --> 01:19:05,519
does light get into the inner buds but

1719
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:07,920
the answer is as as the buds get heavier

1720
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,159
on the tips of the branches that

1721
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:13,158
actually opens the plant up as the

1722
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:15,319
gravity pulls down those branches so now

1723
01:19:13,158 --> 01:19:18,719
all of a sudden the whole length of that

1724
01:19:15,319 --> 01:19:20,599
branch is now sort of the entire plant

1725
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,679
is almost blooming like a

1726
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:26,360
flower and opening up and now all of a

1727
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:29,719
sudden the sun can get in to those uh

1728
01:19:26,359 --> 01:19:31,920
inner buds as well uh but then we also

1729
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:35,679
do um because some of these plants are

1730
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:37,158
you know 12 feet tall 10 feet diameter I

1731
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,359
mean they're

1732
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:42,559
huge uh so we don't harvest the entire

1733
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:45,279
plant all at the same time we do like a

1734
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:48,280
layered Harvest so we just take the top

1735
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:50,479
right Buds and then that also allows the

1736
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:52,319
sun to now penetrate further into the

1737
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:55,198
plant and let those under buds develop

1738
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:57,279
so we'll we'll do three or four harvests

1739
01:19:55,198 --> 01:20:00,359
off the same

1740
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:03,960
plant uh while at the same time

1741
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:07,079
just watching yeah we don't we don't do

1742
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:09,198
we've given up on all the human

1743
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:11,279
manipulations uh the one thing we do

1744
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:14,678
though I should know is as far as you do

1745
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:17,238
have to support the plant um so we just

1746
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:20,800
put four Redwood

1747
01:20:17,238 --> 01:20:23,799
posts uh creating an out Outer you know

1748
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:26,800
a box of post and then we take uh

1749
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:29,000
organic hemp Baker twine so it's

1750
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:32,440
actually food grade hemp

1751
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,399
twine and we just run that twine sort of

1752
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:38,519
like a big spiderweb around uh the plant

1753
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:40,839
to support its branches so uh but that's

1754
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,880
that's all we do so we're going to take

1755
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,279
a short break and be right back um when

1756
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,400
we come back we're going to be talking a

1757
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:48,559
little bit about breeding land races and

1758
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,519
a little bit more about uh preserving

1759
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,280
land races so you are listening to

1760
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,640
shaping fire and my guest today is land

1761
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:56,119
race special specialist Jeff

1762
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:58,480
[Music]

1763
01:20:56,119 --> 01:21:00,519
nordal the cannabis seed Market is

1764
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:02,319
filled with big name and hype breeders

1765
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,040
fighting to get your attention and

1766
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,759
occasionally you discover a breeder who

1767
01:21:04,039 --> 01:21:07,560
is breeding because it is the only thing

1768
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,280
they care to do and they would be doing

1769
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,880
it even if they never made a dime that's

1770
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:15,719
my friend Craig hardsaw who makes seeds

1771
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:17,279
as magnetic genetics Craig comes from

1772
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:18,600
five generations of farmers and is

1773
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:20,840
earning his master's degree in

1774
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,000
horiculture right now he's been growing

1775
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,719
cannabis for 15 years and been breeding

1776
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,760
for nine he hasn't sold many seeds

1777
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:29,239
because he really isn't a sales guy but

1778
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,360
I've personally been growing his seeds

1779
01:21:29,238 --> 01:21:33,718
for years and I know I can always rely

1780
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:36,399
on his seeds to germinate Thrive and

1781
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:38,158
smell and taste great I suggested to

1782
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:40,039
Craig that he should probably sell some

1783
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:43,039
seeds and asked if he had enough

1784
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:45,719
stockpiled to bother much to my shock he

1785
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:47,439
was sitting on five full menus in Cold

1786

Storage that he produced in the last 2

1787
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:52,399
years and hadn't even tried to sell any

1788
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:54,599
of them he was simply too busy breeding

1789
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:56,359
well we his friends convinced him to

1790

service I invited Gas Lamp to advertise

1908
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:54,158
and my guest today is land race

1909
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:56,199
specialist Jeff nordal so here we are at

1910
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:57,679
the big finish and you know during the

1911
01:26:56,198 --> 01:27:00,559
first set we figured out what the hell

1912
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:02,800
land races are and during the second set

1913
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,440
we talked about why we have all fallen

1914
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:09,159
in love with them and and why anytime

1915
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:12,399
the flower is available um serious uh

1916
01:27:09,158 --> 01:27:14,719
weed heads are like on it like catnip

1917
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,399
because we know that that is the special

1918
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:18,880
rare rare thing that we just you know

1919
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:20,920
don't have as much access to anymore and

1920
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,159
um and and they're beloved for good

1921
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:25,039
reasons so in this last set we're going

1922
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:27,158
to talk a little bit about breeding with

1923
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:30,519
land races and then a little bit about

1924
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:32,118
preserving land races so so Jeff you

1925
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,920
know um you know we've already touched

1926
01:27:32,118 --> 01:27:36,759
on breeding a little bit earlier in the

1927
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:39,118
show and um it's weird it's it's like

1928
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:42,400
it's a two-sided coin right like on one

1929
01:27:39,118 --> 01:27:45,479
side breeding with land races is

1930
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:48,719
exhilarating because we like the idea of

1931
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:52,118
taking whatever our favorite you know

1932
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:56,239
modern strain is and then and then bre

1933
01:27:52,118 --> 01:27:58,920
reading it to a land race strain to

1934
01:27:56,238 --> 01:28:01,519
perhaps like increase its Vigor or

1935
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,760
increase its resistance to pass or to

1936
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,840
grab some of those like you know old

1937
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,800
school land race tarpine profiles

1938
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,360
whatever it is that we're trying to do

1939
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:11,960
or actually the other way um try to

1940
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:14,799
breed a land race to a modern plant to

1941
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:16,560
like cut down on how many weeks it takes

1942
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:19,119
to flower so there's there's a lot of

1943
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:21,440
like reasons that we may want to breed

1944
01:28:19,118 --> 01:28:22,839
with a land race but the flip side of

1945
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:26,118
that also

1946
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:30,319
is that every time we we breed a land

1947
01:28:26,118 --> 01:28:33,599
race that is less of that land race that

1948
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:36,559
exists in its pure form for us to

1949
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:39,280
preserve for you know medicinal

1950
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:42,520
applications or for just enjoying that

1951
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:43,920
land race in and of its own right so so

1952
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,719
what are your what are you know I just

1953
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:47,560
like to hear you speak to that about you

1954
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:50,158
know like like like are you Crossing

1955
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:53,520
land races to Modern hybrids or and what

1956
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:57,000
are your thoughts about that

1957
01:28:53,520 --> 01:29:00,440
um yeah so uh there's there's two things

1958
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:04,158
going on when you're sort of deciding to

1959
01:29:00,439 --> 01:29:06,399
work with land race plants and uh so

1960
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:10,679
there's there's there's two goals

1961
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:13,920
there's uh uh preservation so backing it

1962
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:18,239
up so realizing that these are possibly

1963
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:23,158
at risk of going Extinction so uh do a

1964
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:25,759
seed uh reup or uh just an inline breed

1965
01:29:23,158 --> 01:29:27,879
where you're just preserving that uh

1966
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,159
particular line of land race for

1967
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:33,279
preservation uh but then you can go off

1968
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:35,238
and start playing around and

1969
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:39,960
experimenting and doing all kinds of

1970
01:29:35,238 --> 01:29:42,039
crosses and uh uh genetic hybrid work so

1971
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,158
those are both totally valid things but

1972
01:29:42,039 --> 01:29:48,158
if you just

1973
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:51,920
go uh full-blown hybrid and then lose

1974
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:54,559
your it's again with the with the dog

1975
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:58,319
breed thing you can't really take the

1976
01:29:54,560 --> 01:30:00,000
doodle out of the Doberman Piner you

1977
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:01,759
know once it goes in there once once

1978
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,679
you've bred that land race all those

1979
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,520
attributes are all mixed

1980
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:08,480
together yeah it would take lots of

1981
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:11,360
generations to try and back it out to

1982
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:13,599
get back to the original uh variety or

1983
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:16,000
at least close to that so so there's

1984
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:20,239
really uh so there's preservation going

1985
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:23,000
on and that right now at my stage in

1986
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:27,718
where I'm at in my cannabis

1987
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:30,719
Adventures is we're popping new seeds

1988
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:33,760
every year total mystery seeds uh from

1989
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:36,158
these different uh regions of the world

1990
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:38,760
uh even sometimes going back in time to

1991
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:41,879
the 80s 7s

1992
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:44,079
60s and then we're observing those and

1993
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:48,400
right now we're focused on preserving

1994
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:52,559
those genetics and uh to do that really

1995
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:55,198
well uh you can't just go skipping down

1996
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,639
into your garden with you know if you're

1997
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:59,319
trying to pollinate let's say a

1998
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:02,000
Vietnamese plant uh you may have your

1999
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:05,519
male Vietnamese from that same seed

2000
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:08,118
batch or hopefully like three four five

2001
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:10,159
males so you're getting more genetic

2002
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:11,359
diversity uh oh by the way that's

2003
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:13,679
another thing you're trying to do with

2004
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:16,359
your land R seed backups your genetic

2005
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:18,079
backups is you're not doing a lot of

2006
01:31:16,359 --> 01:31:20,399
selection right then you're actually

2007
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:22,639
trying to get the broadest uh gene pool

2008
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:25,960
so you want to use as many females and

2009
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:27,480
as many males from that Pride as you can

2010
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,520
so then when you make let's say a

2011
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:32,079
thousand seeds you're trying to capture

2012
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:35,480
as much genetic diversity in that uh

2013
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:38,439
seed backup and those are just

2014
01:31:35,479 --> 01:31:41,519
uh not primary colors but these are you

2015
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:44,439
know your foundation building blocks of

2016
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:48,400
cannabis breeding that you want to keep

2017
01:31:44,439 --> 01:31:50,919
pure uh uh but then once you have those

2018
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:52,920
locked in and you have those seeds where

2019
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:54,440
you're saving them in a good environment

2020
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,760
that they're going to last you know 10

2021
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:59,719
years plus still be

2022
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:02,960
viable then you know then you have the

2023
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:05,800
freedom to go start making crosses and

2024
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:08,439
hybrids uh that where you're you know

2025
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:12,159
trying to improve things or adapt things

2026
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:15,198
for uh like here in California um you

2027
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:19,279
know I may absolutely

2028
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:22,919
love uh like a the the effect the high

2029
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:25,519
that you got from a plant from LA

2030
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:28,639
but it's a 16we

2031
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:31,520
flower you know it's very difficult to

2032
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:33,480
grow that Outdoors here in California

2033
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,080
before the storms come in and just beat

2034
01:32:33,479 --> 01:32:39,519
the crap out of the plant and it may

2035
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:43,639
even kill it you know uh so you may say

2036
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:46,280
hey I I want that Lous effect but in a

2037
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:49,960
plant that finishes you know in mid

2038
01:32:46,279 --> 01:32:52,840
October so then you you have to start

2039
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:56,118
pondering what would be the least

2040
01:32:52,840 --> 01:33:00,480
intrusive early finishing plant that

2041
01:32:56,118 --> 01:33:02,880
might carry all the LA effects with it

2042
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:06,279
on top of it you get what I mean so that

2043
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,760
that's totally cool totally fair game I

2044
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:10,279
don't think that's

2045
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:13,039
disrespecting any cultures I don't think

2046
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:15,920
that's culturally appropriating um as

2047
01:33:13,039 --> 01:33:17,800
long as you're crediting the The Wider

2048
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:21,760
Global cannabis

2049
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:24,520
Community um and and then our

2050
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:27,520
transparent with how you created that

2051
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:30,520
variety like say yeah if if a taii and a

2052
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:33,040
Lous plant in an Afghan went together

2053
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:35,880
you know document that and let people

2054
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:38,238
know that's where that plant came from

2055
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:43,000
those are its lineage then I think

2056
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:45,000
that's um respectful as well to uh the

2057
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,158
origins and the farmers who created

2058
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:52,079
these plants um so that's that's

2059
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:57,359
totally totally cool and and fair game

2060
01:33:52,079 --> 01:34:00,359
but uh the sort of ethical

2061
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:02,759
shortsighted blunder would be to

2062
01:34:00,359 --> 01:34:04,920
immediately at least this is my opinion

2063
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:07,199
just immediately start making hybrid

2064
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:09,279
crosses without backing up and

2065
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,399
preserving that original land race that

2066
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:12,279
may have taken hundreds if not thousands

2067
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:16,158
of

2068
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:18,079
years to create that unique genetic when

2069
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:20,359
you say back it up would that just be a

2070
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:22,039
simple open pollination like in a tent

2071
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:24,479
or something that way you're not you're

2072
01:34:22,039 --> 01:34:25,760
not losing the pollen into other plants

2073
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:28,319
but you're just you're just letting them

2074
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:31,159
all make more

2075
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:34,439
seeds yeah yeah yeah yeah so sorry sorry

2076
01:34:31,158 --> 01:34:36,158
I kind of rambled on that so the thing

2077
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:39,839
is if you're dealing with a lot of

2078
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:43,519
varieties of uh pure lines of land

2079
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:46,560
race uh you can't be sloppy with your

2080
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:48,679
pollen and uh just bring pollen down

2081
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,719
into your garden and potentially have

2082
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:54,560
that pollen drift onto other plants

2083
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:57,960
right uh so so the the technique that I

2084
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:00,280
use that works well but I'm open to

2085
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:04,279
other ideas if other people have come up

2086
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:08,319
with other uh techniques that are work

2087
01:35:04,279 --> 01:35:10,439
is anyway what I do is we grow the land

2088
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:11,920
race plants out in our land race

2089
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:15,839
Botanical Garden that's where you get

2090
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:19,199
the big 10 12 15 foot tall plants but

2091
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:21,079
before those plants go into flower I

2092
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:22,000
label each one of those plants with its

2093
01:35:21,079 --> 01:35:25,198
variet

2094
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,479
plus its pheno number so it might be

2095
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:30,479
Mexico

2096
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:31,799
halisco three out of four alisco plants

2097
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:36,718
were're growing so this one's number

2098
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:39,480
three feno right so I'll take cuting off

2099
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:43,719
that number three halisco

2100
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:47,439
plant take those cuting to my other

2101
01:35:43,719 --> 01:35:49,520
property uh root those cuting and now I

2102
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:53,879
have very

2103
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:56,119
small oh versions of that plant right

2104
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:58,079
that are now that are now I'm keeping

2105
01:35:56,118 --> 01:36:01,198
them in like a 3

2106
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:03,198
gallon pot so now when I need to go

2107
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:06,198
isolate them for pollinating I can

2108
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:10,559
easily just move them around my property

2109
01:36:06,198 --> 01:36:12,719
um and and then uh the males I keep in a

2110
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:15,280
a separate area and then we even isolate

2111
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:17,639
our males for a time to make sure some

2112
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:18,840
other plants pollen is not drifting onto

2113
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:21,800
that male

2114
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:25,760
plant uh so so we know we're getting

2115
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:28,760
that just that pure uh pollen and then

2116
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:32,960
that pollen gets taken to that very

2117
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:36,039
isolated cluster of let's say halisco

2118
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:38,439
number three uh but but when we're doing

2119
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:41,840
let's say halisco if we had four plants

2120
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:46,279
I would then put helisa one 2 three and

2121
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:47,960
four cuting all in one area right so

2122
01:36:46,279 --> 01:36:50,359
we've got the

2123
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:52,840
cuting all there they're now in flower

2124
01:36:50,359 --> 01:36:57,039
mode and then I hopefully we'll have

2125
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:59,039
three four halisco males and I'll take

2126
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:02,158
all that pollen from all four of those

2127
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:04,960
males and then go evenly distribute that

2128
01:37:02,158 --> 01:37:06,920
over all the uh

2129
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,520
cuting you get what I mean yeah I

2130
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:10,359
totally follow and I really like the

2131
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:13,239
idea I really like the idea that you

2132
01:37:10,359 --> 01:37:15,719
take the cuting early on when the plants

2133
01:37:13,238 --> 01:37:17,519
in your main Garden are in veg and then

2134
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:18,800
you just move them away cuz honestly

2135
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,719
before you explained that you had the

2136
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,960
second property I was trying to picture

2137
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:27,079
you safely pollinating these plants in

2138
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:29,039
your garden with all 300 land races and

2139
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:30,800
I'm like that sounds like hell man that

2140
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:34,079
sounds impossible to

2141
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,760
succeed oh now yeah you you you get

2142
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:40,000
pollen drift I mean you kind of have to

2143
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:43,119
treat pollen like Ebola you know it's

2144
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,079
like it just gets everywhere it will

2145
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:47,920
find a way the the cool thing that most

2146
01:37:45,079 --> 01:37:50,198
people know though is with uh pollen

2147
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:55,039
water will immediately render it

2148
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:57,960
nonviable so um uh that's another way to

2149
01:37:55,039 --> 01:38:01,479
get a dirty hippie to shower a lot too

2150
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:04,520
is is to put him in charge of the oh

2151
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:06,799
yeah I'll I take 10 showers a day if not

2152
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:10,840
more you know when I'm uh in the middle

2153
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:13,719
of doing breeding projects um but uh

2154
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:17,319
yeah so that's so we do kind of an open

2155
01:38:13,719 --> 01:38:21,679
pollination but we do it on just a very

2156
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:24,679
small uh with small little cuttings um

2157
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:27,599
and my understanding at least is that

2158
01:38:24,679 --> 01:38:29,880
those those cuting from those original

2159
01:38:27,599 --> 01:38:32,760
plants are the exact same genetic so

2160
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:35,639
those those seeds will be true to that

2161
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:40,000
plant it just makes it uh you have a lot

2162
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:42,400
more agility and easily being able to uh

2163
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,198
isolate and move transport plants around

2164
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:45,238
for

2165
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:47,759
breeding cool so I want to I want to

2166
01:38:45,238 --> 01:38:49,759
continue down this uh this preserving

2167
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,599
path that we've started on you know I

2168
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:55,639
think a lot more people are thinking

2169
01:38:51,599 --> 01:38:56,960
about um you know land races you know I

2170
01:38:55,639 --> 01:38:59,800
guess I'm going to talk about two levels

2171
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:01,880
of magnitude generally people are very

2172
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:03,560
interested in land races because

2173
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:05,679
especially if they're connoisseurs

2174
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:07,880
because so much of modern cannabis takes

2175
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:10,440
tastes the same so the interest in land

2176
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:12,639
race is increasing and they are seen as

2177
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:16,519
Elite and very desirable all of that's

2178
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:19,279
true but also um you know as as kind of

2179
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:22,199
like Global Travel uh for cannabis

2180
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:25,319
people you know continues to increase

2181
01:39:22,198 --> 01:39:27,839
and along with the technological ways to

2182
01:39:25,319 --> 01:39:30,319
tell friends about them we're getting

2183
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,960
experiences like uh like recently A lot

2184
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:35,559
of people watched on Instagram like uh

2185
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,960
you know Kevin jodrey and Danny Montero

2186
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:40,440
and um and IG land race genetics like

2187
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:43,520
they put together a group of people and

2188
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:47,000
all went to Pakistan right and so um

2189
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:49,280
like I was I was rivited by those videos

2190
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,319
of of like people who I know and my

2191
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:53,800
friends who are like suddenly in

2192
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:55,759
Pakistan places where I normally only

2193
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:58,079
see represented in like war and

2194
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:02,119
terrorism movies you know and suddenly

2195
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:04,920
they're all there like wearing beards um

2196
01:40:02,118 --> 01:40:06,799
you know in Pakistan and interacting

2197
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:08,679
with the locals and and checking out

2198
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,639
their hash and checking out their plants

2199
01:40:08,679 --> 01:40:13,118
and I was all like wow this is great

2200
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:15,239
like like I wasn't you know on this trip

2201
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:17,198
but I I feel like I I got a bunch of

2202
01:40:15,238 --> 01:40:20,598
these experiences from the trip right

2203
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:21,598
and so it just increases the meaning and

2204
01:40:20,599 --> 01:40:24,840
value

2205
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:27,279
of of land race seeds and genetics in My

2206
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:29,079
overall head and so I I think that

2207
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:32,079
there's more and more people who are

2208
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:34,960
just interested in land races which is

2209
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:38,519
good of course because you know the the

2210
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:41,679
the the land race origin areas like

2211
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:43,800
Thailand specifically are starting to

2212
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:46,279
get

2213
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:48,239
um uh we're like bunch of our people are

2214
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:50,439
bringing seeds there and and developing

2215
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:52,799
them in Thailand and so and so their

2216
01:40:50,439 --> 01:40:54,319
natural land races getting diluted right

2217
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,320
so all of this is to set up this

2218
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:59,319
question that um you know I can see that

2219
01:40:57,319 --> 01:41:02,639
land races are going to become

2220
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:04,399
increasingly popular and yet we already

2221
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:07,319
are trying to preserve them for

2222
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:11,118
medicinal reasons um I'd like to hear

2223
01:41:07,319 --> 01:41:14,639
you speak to the idea of preservation

2224
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:18,639
and a how do you think that um land

2225
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:20,599
races are effectively preserved and B do

2226
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,960
you think there's any chance in hell

2227
01:41:20,599 --> 01:41:23,880
that we're not actually going to

2228
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:26,960
eventually lose all the land races

2229
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:28,639
because they are a set number today and

2230
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,599
that number is likely just probably

2231
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:34,079
going to T continue to decrease but

2232
01:41:31,599 --> 01:41:36,719
maybe maybe I've got an um you know an

2233
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:38,359
especially jaded view of it so I know

2234
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:39,760
that's a big question but I'm just G to

2235
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:43,799
like hand you the mic and hear what your

2236
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:46,400
thoughts are yeah yeah so um yeah the

2237
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:50,880
extinction through hybridization is

2238
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:54,158
incredibly real and it's happening um so

2239
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:57,199
so yeah a lot of people are sounding the

2240
01:41:54,158 --> 01:42:00,039
alarm like hey we really need to start

2241
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:03,238
uh backing these up uh before they all

2242
01:42:00,039 --> 01:42:05,719
go extinct uh as far as these land races

2243
01:42:03,238 --> 01:42:08,319
so

2244
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:12,599
um

2245
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:15,679
and yeah so so yes that is really

2246
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:19,480
happening and um so so the extinction is

2247
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:23,279
a real concern period full stop ABS

2248
01:42:19,479 --> 01:42:24,759
absolutely um and and it's not just uh

2249
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:26,639
like pollen

2250
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:29,520
drift it's

2251
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:32,599
actually you know folks we're going to

2252
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:34,960
get to a point I mean we we've romantici

2253
01:42:32,599 --> 01:42:37,960
here in the US we may romanticize this

2254
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,239
little secluded fantasy Village you know

2255
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:42,399
in the

2256
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:44,319
Himalayas you hike up to and you think

2257
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:47,039
you're going to find this like amazing

2258
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:48,960
weed that's grown by monks or something

2259
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:51,760
or the whole village like grows his

2260
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,158
magical weed uh and you take this track

2261
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:57,199
up there and you get up there and

2262
01:42:53,158 --> 01:42:57,198
they're like hey we got

2263
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,880
cookies we got

2264
01:42:59,399 --> 01:43:04,158
Coca-Cola yeah exactly and they're like

2265
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:07,118
yeah we're we're growing gelato and

2266
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:09,319
Diesel and OG and uh oh that's the kind

2267
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:11,158
of cookies that you mean ah me I I

2268
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:13,759
thought you meant like Western Foods you

2269
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:16,399
mean no no no no no I mean it may be

2270
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:19,480
that they're like blast in I mean no

2271
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:22,399
it's cool but yeah they may be actually

2272
01:43:19,479 --> 01:43:25,439
blasting Snoop Dog growing you know

2273
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:27,359
California strains up there and and we

2274
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:29,879
of course romanticize that they're

2275
01:43:27,359 --> 01:43:32,359
supposed to stay isolated and unique uh

2276
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:34,199
when in reality they want to they want

2277
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:36,399
to grow the height too they want to

2278
01:43:34,198 --> 01:43:38,399
integrate and they they're watching

2279
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:40,158
stuff in California and Amsterdam

2280
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:42,000
thinking that's that's really cool why

2281
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:44,799
would they want to gr grow their

2282
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,079
grandfather's old larhe

2283
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:50,239
weed so anyway these are just like

2284
01:43:47,079 --> 01:43:52,599
cultural phenomenons and things that

2285
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:54,359
happen and there's no judgment or

2286
01:43:52,599 --> 01:43:57,360
anything you just have to realize that

2287
01:43:54,359 --> 01:43:58,880
that's this these are things that happen

2288
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:03,158
um

2289
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:05,359
so uh there seems to be some value in

2290
01:44:03,158 --> 01:44:07,158
preserving these genetics and a lot of

2291
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:10,039
these genetics

2292
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:12,879
um you know could go back hundreds if

2293
01:44:10,039 --> 01:44:17,000
not thousands of years and they're kind

2294
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:19,599
of uh in a way almost like

2295
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,880
cultural biographies or even

2296
01:44:19,599 --> 01:44:25,239
autobiographies from the actual breeders

2297
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:27,480
you know antique art is too yeah and

2298
01:44:25,238 --> 01:44:28,559
they're infusing so it's a plant but

2299
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:32,678
it's

2300
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:34,960
also infused with uh cultures values and

2301
01:44:32,679 --> 01:44:39,118
their stories and so so in a way it's

2302
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:41,118
almost like their uh cultural part of

2303
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:43,238
their cultural story too you know just

2304
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:46,759
like their food and their seasonings and

2305
01:44:43,238 --> 01:44:49,198
dishes and relig dance and religion and

2306
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:51,480
the and the the Cannabis is a reflection

2307
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:54,678
of those values and Aesthetics that

2308
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:56,879
they've chosen for um so it just be a

2309
01:44:54,679 --> 01:45:00,599
super bummer to have

2310
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:04,920
those disappear and uh just get

2311
01:45:00,599 --> 01:45:07,679
hybridized or or such um and then you

2312
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:10,239
know once once some of these cultures

2313
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:12,039
Also may go through like you know the

2314
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:15,759
hype

2315
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:20,560
phase there may be in like 20 years all

2316
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:22,960
of a sudden reinter in in their heritage

2317
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:25,320
genetics and if if someone wasn't

2318
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:29,439
backing this stuff up you know it may be

2319
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:33,799
gone um and it may be that they actually

2320
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:35,598
have to look outside to other people who

2321
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,199
who happen to keep those genetics you

2322
01:45:35,599 --> 01:45:40,159
know in their from their trip that they

2323
01:45:38,198 --> 01:45:41,799
took to that region they've been keeping

2324
01:45:40,158 --> 01:45:44,519
them in their sock drawer for the last

2325
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:46,159
20 years you know so um there just seems

2326
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:49,480
it doesn't seem to be

2327
01:45:46,158 --> 01:45:51,158
negative in any way by uh backing up and

2328
01:45:49,479 --> 01:45:55,198
preserving these genetic and it just

2329
01:45:51,158 --> 01:46:02,319
seems like a good Long

2330
01:45:55,198 --> 01:46:06,719
View uh strategy that there is value in

2331
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:09,118
keeping these genetics around and

2332
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:13,239
preserving them if if nothing more for

2333
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:18,198
just historical purpose but i' argue

2334
01:46:13,238 --> 01:46:21,519
there's probably tons of medicinal uh

2335
01:46:18,198 --> 01:46:23,198
compounds and turpine combinations and

2336
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:28,320
such that may actually

2337
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:32,118
have some real uh medicinal value uh it

2338
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:34,158
going into the future and uh and then

2339
01:46:32,118 --> 01:46:37,799
just the effects and everything else so

2340
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:40,559
there's there's a lot of incentive and

2341
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:44,800
reason that uh these genetics really

2342
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:46,039
should be backed up so um um and and and

2343
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,000
lots of different people around the

2344
01:46:46,039 --> 01:46:51,840
world are are playing different parts

2345
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,840
either by uh Gathering in and hunting uh

2346
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:56,880
these seeds and actually just collecting

2347
01:46:53,840 --> 01:47:00,319
them and then other people are sort of

2348
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:03,599
Distributing them as hubs you know for

2349
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:08,039
people who are uh interested in access

2350
01:47:03,599 --> 01:47:11,039
to these genetics um something that

2351
01:47:08,039 --> 01:47:13,118
we've sort of toyed around with here in

2352
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:15,599
h Santa Cruz and something that i' I'd

2353
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:18,439
really like to be a part of and even

2354
01:47:15,599 --> 01:47:21,039
potentially work with uh a larger

2355
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:23,960
organization uh who has like grant money

2356
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:28,158
and such but to actually put together um

2357
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:32,639
an actual cannabis uh seed bank like a

2358
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:35,399
public domain seed bank to try and back

2359
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:38,039
up especially uh as far as land race

2360
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:39,879
genetics uh try and back up and preserve

2361
01:47:38,039 --> 01:47:42,639
as much of those genetics as possible

2362
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:44,760
but then very important

2363
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:47,118
philosophically um that would be public

2364
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:49,320
domain where everyone would have access

2365
01:47:47,118 --> 01:47:51,118
to these there's no proprietary

2366
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:54,559
ownership

2367
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:56,238
uh of of any of these genetics um and

2368
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:57,880
you'd be you'd be preserving them for

2369
01:47:56,238 --> 01:48:00,079
their own right you don't mean like a

2370
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:02,760
seed bank like people use seed bank now

2371
01:48:00,079 --> 01:48:06,039
very often as just like a seed bank

2372
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,679
store or a seed bank distributor where

2373
01:48:06,039 --> 01:48:09,880
where where that there's there's the

2374
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:12,639
profit moit motive primarily you're

2375
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:15,319
talking about a more classical seed bank

2376
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:17,760
like like those of us who save seeds

2377
01:48:15,319 --> 01:48:20,759
right where you're you're making a

2378
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,960
library preservation yeah yeah the seed

2379
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:25,320
preservation that's you know going on in

2380
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:28,760
Norway or wherever yeah exactly that big

2381
01:48:25,319 --> 01:48:31,238
building that unsurprisingly flooded

2382
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:34,360
yeah yeah so that those kind of uh seed

2383
01:48:31,238 --> 01:48:38,118
banks and uh like here

2384
01:48:34,359 --> 01:48:41,118
UCSC uh University California Santa Cruz

2385
01:48:38,118 --> 01:48:44,279
um did something else which was the

2386
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:46,759
Human Genome Project where they ma the

2387
01:48:44,279 --> 01:48:49,800
entire Human Genome and then put that in

2388
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:52,159
the public domain so they were in a race

2389
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:54,159
with some of the pharmaceutical

2390
01:48:52,158 --> 01:48:57,000
companies and researchers who wanted

2391
01:48:54,158 --> 01:49:02,559
that information to be

2392
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:06,639
proprietary but uh UCS and our sort of

2393
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:09,320
hippie for the community sort of Vibes

2394
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:11,599
at least UCSC decided to put that all in

2395
01:49:09,319 --> 01:49:14,479
the public domain so it's the Human

2396
01:49:11,599 --> 01:49:17,279
Genome Project where anyone uh can

2397
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:21,279
actually access uh that information and

2398
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:22,559
we'd like to see in that spirit uh

2399
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:25,920
something with a

2400
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:30,400
cannabis uh seed bank or library or

2401
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:33,279
archive where everyone would have equal

2402
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:35,319
access uh to all those genetics for you

2403
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:38,639
know there'd be a procedure to obviously

2404
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:41,198
to to get them but uh where yeah where

2405
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:43,118
they're available to everyone because we

2406
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:45,198
kind of come from the philosophy that

2407
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:46,039
humans did not create cannabis it came

2408
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:48,799
from the

2409
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:52,319
universe and

2410
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:54,800
so who who are we to claim ownership

2411
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:58,399
it's cannabis is here for the people and

2412
01:49:54,800 --> 01:50:02,440
the magic of it is connecting more

2413
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:05,399
people in a positive way uh with with

2414
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:09,000
cannabis like that that has the

2415
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:11,559
potential to actually shift things in a

2416
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:14,520
positive trajectory for this plant but

2417
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:18,159
if we're going to start playing these uh

2418
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:21,760
ownership proprietary

2419
01:50:18,158 --> 01:50:26,559
exclusive uh commercial dollar chasing

2420
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:28,360
games with a plant that generally when

2421
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:31,039
you consume

2422
01:50:28,359 --> 01:50:32,839
it a lot of times has the opposite

2423
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:36,439
effect or opposite

2424
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:37,800
message that that would be yeah that's

2425
01:50:36,439 --> 01:50:41,319
definitely in the spirit of just the

2426
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:45,000
Cannabis experience is making things

2427
01:50:41,319 --> 01:50:48,238
available to to everyone equal access

2428
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,560
share the share the love break it down

2429
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:51,519
cool man well I I think that that's a

2430
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:54,000
