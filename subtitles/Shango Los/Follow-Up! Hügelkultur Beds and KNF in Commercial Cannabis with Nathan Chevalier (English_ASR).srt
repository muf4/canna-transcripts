1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,910
so Nate thank you so much for having me

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,309
back on your farm um you know last time

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,440
when we were here in the spring we just

4
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:15,928
shot that great video about your like

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,300
very large Google culture deployment

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,579
would you give a sort of reminder of the

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,800
the size and general dimensions of the

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:26,549
hookah culture deployment yeah it's a

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,859
sixty three hundred square feet and it's

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:35,670
just a small flat area the mounds or the

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:45,420
the hills run from 25 feet up to 75 feet

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:47,129
long so so we talked to you in the

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,480
spring you know this was the rnd part of

14
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,488
your property you've got your your

15
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,128
proper greenhouses where you do other

16
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:55,558
kinds of living soil probiotic and KNF

17
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,268
growing but who cultural is like in your

18
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,729
heart right yeah so you wanted to do

19
00:00:57,268 --> 00:01:02,670
this this year and and just kind of see

20
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,439
you know how it went and and when we

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,040
last talked a lot of your concern was

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,509
whether or not the immaturity of the

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,240
hookah culture because you had just

24
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:14,219
built them was gonna impact the flower

25
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,798
and whether or not you were gonna get

26
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,019
any yield I've seen them but I'll let

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,360
you go ahead and say it so how did you

28
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,179
have some success yeah yeah I think we

29
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,390
did it's uh it's good to go down and see

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,799
the plants happy and have some nice big

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,460
buds on there it wasn't it wasn't always

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,820
like that

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:38,849
we had some some issues along the way

34
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:41,368
with drought I would say it was probably

35
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:44,728
the biggest thing that we had hit our

36
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:47,430
plants as we were digging these these

37
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,899
hugo mounds out we we actually decided

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,118
to escalate down into the ground a

39
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,489
little bit we started all of our

40
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,468
material was saturated completely wet

41
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,560
but this took a lot longer than we

42
00:01:55,468 --> 00:02:02,419
thought to get it all done and as we

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,070
were digging out replant or refilling

44
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,950
spreading out the materials they were

45
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:11,069
drying out and as we got to the very

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,490
last one or was actually the second to

47
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:18,530
last one we deemed it

48
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:21,680
to be a little too much of a a burden to

49
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,770
try and get it wet enough to to plant

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,069
into it so we cut it short on the last

51
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:31,250
one we're gonna try to get it all dug

52
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:34,000
out here before before the rain hits

53
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:37,159
after we harvest here and get that one

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,289
so so if you had this kind of drought

55
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,270
condition because your materials you've

56
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:42,859
started with the materials wet but

57
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,290
before you could get him in the huugle

58
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,770
hole they got dry and so you're

59
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:50,989
essentially packing dry holes I would

60
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,060
think that you probably took water and

61
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,560
just drench the hell out of them is that

62
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,020
it was that your first line of defense

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,789
yeah it was we you know going into this

64
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,390
whole thing it's the water conservation

65
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:03,979
is the the idea behind it and the fact

66
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:07,969
that you're gonna have these really big

67
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:12,169
deep nutrient-rich beds full of

68
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:16,870
microbiology but it it wasn't the case

69
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:20,779
going into this first year it it was dry

70
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:24,770
unworkable no sticks and you could see

71
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,919
it in the plants as the time went on and

72
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,890
in the early stages they seemed like

73
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,409
they may be kind of bottom down a little

74
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:36,589
bit or maybe weren't growing as fast as

75
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:41,060
they should a lot of yellow leaf from

76
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,539
from drought conditions so you know it

77
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,930
wasn't all it wasn't all easy but

78
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:50,659
actually none of it was you know every

79
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,300
year moving forward is gonna be much

80
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,799
more much easier because of what we did

81
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,910
this year so we're excited about that so

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,850
we were talking about how you were gonna

83
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:01,250
you know as you know you are both a

84
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:04,009
cannabis farmer and also very much a

85
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,750
business owner and you feel that no more

86
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:08,569
than this year right I've heard before

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,949
and you know you were talking about like

88
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,099
okay you've got your regular greenhouses

89
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:15,649
and you were gonna devote x-variable of

90
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,209
resources to this R&amp;D project and the

91
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,009
Google beds but actually ended up being

92
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,720
quite a bit of resources to dig out the

93
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,810
holes and fill them and put the whole

94
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,370
thing and you were just like you know

95
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,019
I'm okay with hookah cultures for the

96
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,750
future but it'd be really great

97
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,519
to get enough abundant crop to make this

98
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,649
worthwhile and to at least be in the

99
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,799
black for the year right on that growing

100
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:38,269
area totally would you say that you have

101
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,770
got other an abundant enough enough of a

102
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:43,098
crop where it was worth the overall

103
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:44,930
effort I think so yeah I it's you know

104
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:46,969
time will tell we have a weaker still

105
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,819
left to harvest we're just getting ready

106
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,840
to start to pull the first ones down

107
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:54,800
it's probably gonna be two weeks before

108
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:56,478
the last ones come down so a better idea

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,478
then but I think we're gonna be

110
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:05,389
somewhere around 60% of our typical

111
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:08,508
yield I wouldn't say that the youth of

112
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,490
the Google cultures necessarily impacted

113
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:13,460
the plants I mean there are certainly

114
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,348
some things that you may want to do

115
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,478
different and better as you make your

116
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:20,149
best practices but you know we were

117
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:22,459
seeing coal as the size of your arm you

118
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:27,019
know it was it's it's visually

119
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:29,299
impressive what would you say is some

120
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:33,859
aspect of it that that you're looking to

121
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:36,288
improve next year just the soil

122
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,288
structure in the beds I would say is the

123
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:41,629
main thing we used a lot of the native

124
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:43,339
soil that we have down there and wood

125
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:46,490
were the two main things that went into

126
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:49,189
it our native soil is very rocky and

127
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:53,569
very clay like so it's not the easiest

128
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:55,668
to work so our goal over over the course

129
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,639
of the fall and into the winter and

130
00:05:55,668 --> 00:06:00,288
yoonah to the spring is gonna be just

131
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,598
continually adding layers of mulch to

132
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:06,019
these beds and and get the organic

133
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:08,060
matter built up in there get mycelium

134
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:10,370
networks built up in there get

135
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,519
microbiology built up in there

136
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,069
all of this through permaculture

137
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,889
practices or maybe doing some mushroom

138
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,778
logs and some different things so yeah

139
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,650
it's it's gonna be it's gonna be fun

140
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:24,649
throughout the winter I'm looking

141
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:26,929
forward to having some downtime from

142
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,138
farming and concentrate on building the

143
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,209
bed

144
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,160
yeah I think everybody's like excited

145
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:35,319
for and looking forward to harvest to at

146
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,800
least move on to different things you

147
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,389
know different tasks for the day I was

148
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,569
happy for you to see that you were able

149
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,728
to do some food inter planting - because

150
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,379
you know part of the idea is that that

151
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:50,228
you've got your cannabis plants up top

152
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,870
but you're also running you know

153
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:55,149
companion plants that are you know you

154
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,550
know positively alio Pathak with the

155
00:06:55,149 --> 00:07:00,969
cannabis but also to grow some food you

156
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,060
know to reap you know benefit from that

157
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,070
as well so so how did that go um it

158
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,959
actually was a complete mistake this

159
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:12,939
year we uh we were and are planting or

160
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,239
planning on doing a bunch of

161
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:19,089
polycultures and Inter plantings and you

162
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,819
know making these beds you know just

163
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:23,439
full of abundance are you saying that

164
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:25,149
was a volunteer volunteer bury

165
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,199
everything that came up underneath was

166
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:31,779
volunteer actually we have pumpkin

167
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,280
squash there's tobacco down there wait

168
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,859
so it was everything that was in your

169
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,569
compost and then you then used to fill

170
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,120
the Google culture that starts popping

171
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:42,120
up yeah that's actually pretty cool

172
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:54,129
so another one of your goals was going

173
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:56,649
to be to use as many of the nutrients

174
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:58,360
both the rod a nutrients just so yours

175
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:00,698
throwing on to amend the soil but also

176
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,009
the inputs for your can F ferments

177
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,870
you're gonna try to source as much of

178
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,740
that as possible right here on your

179
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:12,310
acreage so you can you know keep the

180
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:16,569
circle tight how did that go pretty good

181
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:19,418
we we did a lot of harvesting early in

182
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:21,519
the year and preparing our f PJs and our

183
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:23,139
F F J's

184
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:28,389
maybe the fermented plant juice and

185
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:33,629
fruit juices and also we did some stuff

186
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:39,110
for pesticides we did a habanero ffj

187
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:43,379
did also our ellaby's with our goat milk

188
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:46,649
see that and we did a little bit of a

189
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:52,049
sea water but beyond that we didn't get

190
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:54,059
into much of the other K&amp;F stuff but

191
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,519
that stuff we've got a pretty good hold

192
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,859
on and we're we're getting ready to move

193
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,699
further on into the into the regimens

194
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,710
and even outside of the permits it

195
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,180
seemed like you use a lot of the

196
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,840
biomaterial that was on the property

197
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:12,959
like you know you turned me on to how

198
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,820
rich of for stuff is last time I was

199
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,560
here right and so the more I look into

200
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,290
it the more like I realize that stuff is

201
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,849
like soft magic you know yeah so so you

202
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,319
used a lot of that and obviously you

203
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,330
used a lot of brush because it looks

204
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,190
like you kept on even after you dug the

205
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,930
Whoville you kept on putting stuff on

206
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,140
there and just so the idea was for it to

207
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:35,250
break down so so where did you source

208
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:37,529
some of that stuff to we just around

209
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:42,179
anywhere we could we got most of our

210
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:45,379
forest stuff from just off of the the

211
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:49,579
full Sun flat and our homestead flat a

212
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:54,840
lot of the other stuff that went into

213
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:59,360
the plant matter and the wood came from

214
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:01,620
a PG&amp;E Extension that we're working on

215
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,289
we're bringing we're bringing power to

216
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,179
our place and we had a lot of brush and

217
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:08,579
tree clearing to do and we were able to

218
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,899
gather up all of that stuff and get it

219
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,690
down there and get that stuff in there

220
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,490
and feeling really good about the the

221
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,070
ability to use that stuff oh right on

222
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,810
cool yeah well thank you again for the

223
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,850
tour this spring because that was really

224
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,679
not only exciting but it was really

225
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,509
inspiring right to see who GU culture

226
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,279
deployed on that level and thanks for

227
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:29,600
having us back to take more pictures and

228
