[Music]

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000
one of the key attributes i look for in

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,759
friends is an open mind with an ability

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,399
to learn new things and evolve even

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,160
change opinions while some folks respect

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,919
being the same as they've always been

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,278
i'm not one of those people i'm a pretty

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,039
active learner

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,679
and active learning is also a healthy

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,679
trait for a cannabis cultivator to have

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,079
for as long as any of us have been alive

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,479
we've had to learn cultivation in secret

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,479
picking them hints from print magazines

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,959
the guy the gardening store random folks

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,279
at parties and if we're lucky maybe a

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,280
mentor in the cannabis underground

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,640
eventually the internet and forums came

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,039
about and that has been great for

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,878
spreading both good and bad information

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,039
about growing

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,280
we're in a period now where cultivators

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,760
have the opportunity to partner more and

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,320
more with institutional scientists to

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,198
compare our cultivation recipes to

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,039
established science to develop new

26
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,640
modern best practices for growing

27

cannabis

28

one thing for sure as cultivators the

29

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640
uh hopefully this this stuff will pass

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,360
and we'll be we'll be meeting again in

120
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,599
person amen all right so you know it's

121
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
always been the teaming with trilogy you

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,280
first you did teaming with microbes and

123
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,519
then it was teeming with nutrients and

124
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,879
then it was teaming with fungi

125
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,560
and and then you know and then you

126
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,120
switched over and you did an autoflower

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
book but now suddenly you're back with a

128
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,160
fourth book in what we all know is a

129
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,600
trilogy so did you always know that

130
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,759
there was going to be a fourth book

131
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,759
eventually or did you just become

132
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,040
inspired after learning more about

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,960
bacteria

134
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,520
oh you know you never you never think

135
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,959
about the next book uh and in fact

136
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,039
once you write a book you never think

137
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,799
you're ever going to do it again it's a

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
very difficult process you have to go

139
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
down in that little rabbit hole and and

140
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,319
and stay down there and write it but you

141
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,960
know when i wrote the first book teaming

142
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,199
with microbes i did it because i i was

143
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,680
upset that nobody really understood and

144
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,560
was talking about dr elaine ingham's

145
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,800
soil food web concepts

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,120
this book i got excited about after

147
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,759
talking to dr james white

148
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,399
because it adds a whole new dimension to

149
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
the soil food web uh and and just

150
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,399
creates a

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,038
completely different picture

152
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,959
and raises new questions which which

153
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,000
we'll be able to study and experiment

154
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,638
with uh and become better growers so so

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,360
i i wasn't expecting it when i came

156
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,439
across the subject matter uh it flipped

157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,520
me out to the point where i knew i had

158
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,079
to really investigate it and then when i

159
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,519
discovered that it had some some some

160
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:46,079
real possibilities for growers out there

161
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,279
it became a necessity to write the book

162
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,439
you know when i was trying to figure out

163
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,439
how to refer to the series now that

164
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,399
there's four in the series i actually

165
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,560
looked up

166
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,959
you know if a trilogy is three books

167
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
what is four books and you've got two

168
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,719
there are two options there's a

169
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,240
tetralogy or a quadrilogy do you or have

170
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
you chosen one of those what do you use

171
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
to describe four basically

172
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,959
you know i haven't really figured it out

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,160
yet uh because i i i also try to figure

174
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,839
out what i use to sign the books

175
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
and so i haven't really come come to a

176
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,000
decision but it's going to be one of

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,240
those two words probably right on so um

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,800
when we've talked before um you know

179
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,319
you've described like reading the series

180
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,000
right for for those of us who have been

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,160
with you since the beginning you know

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,319
you put out teaming with microbes and it

183
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,319
was an easy read it was a fun read and

184
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,639
we learned a hell of a lot and and

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,600
honestly it really made the the you know

186
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,079
microbe life and the soil food web much

187
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,160
more accessible to a lot of us in

188
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,478
cannabis cultivation and then your

189
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,880
second book teaming with nutrients was

190
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,719
also highly educated but as you've said

191
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,478
before it's a little bit of a heavier

192
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
lift as far as a read goes there's a lot

193
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,318
more um

194
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,318
vocabulary numerical science shall we

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,879
say than the teaming with microbes and

196
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,280
then teaming with fungi again was a you

197
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,879
know a lot of you know biological

198
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,559
storytelling and it was things that we

199
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,719
could do stuff right about you know

200
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
right away and so you know the the

201
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,080
various books have got like different

202
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,000
heft of like of of difficulty in reading

203
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,399
like where on that scale do you find

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,478
this new book on bacteria

205
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,120
well on one level i find it uh you know

206
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,399
i find it very simple to understand but

207
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
on the other level it's the most

208
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,359
complicated and the reason is because it

209
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,439
does talk about bacteria

210
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,560
we're only familiar with bacteria in a

211
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,959
general sense in a health sense uh and

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,519
and and so when you start using

213
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,120
bacterial names and have to spell them

214
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,598
out and things like that it becomes much

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,879
more difficult and then when you start

216
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,120
dealing with

217
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,439
an organism that's so small that we

218
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,360
really don't study it as a society we

219
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,319
don't study it in school other than

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,439
that's a bacteria that little dot uh you

221
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
know

222
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,240
you gotta learn some new stuff and i had

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,759
to teach myself and and i figured uh you

224
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,079
know i probably had to teach the reader

225
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,120
as well before i could get into the real

226
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,279
subject matter uh of what bacteria do

227
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,959
for us with regard to plants you know

228
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,799
that's that's a that's good in you know

229
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,719
good well put because you're right you

230
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,038
know i when i was reading your book um

231
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,280
and thank you for sending me it uh the

232
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:20,240
you know the first half of it is a bit

233
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,000
of um you know refresher of

234
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,478
uh high school biology a lot of stuff i

235
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,399
hadn't thought about in a long time but

236
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,800
it is absolutely necessary for the

237
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,719
second half of the book which is like

238
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,479
you know getting into a race car it goes

239
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
fast and it's thrilling and it's

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,639
absolutely crazy the things that that

241
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,719
you that you learn from the book but you

242
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,519
really do need to be reminded what you

243
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,800
know

244
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,120
you know i mean i i haven't thought

245
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,240
about gram-positive and gram-negative

246
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,639
things in a long long time so right um

247
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,720
right uh one other thing that we should

248
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,480
hit on before we get into the meat of

249
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,240
the topic just a piece of vocabulary um

250
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,120
would you discuss the difference between

251
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,000
the words bacteria and bacterium

252
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,919
right uh and this is really really key

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,679
and it's one of the one of the reasons

254
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,199
why people really can't understand

255
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,719
bacteria

256
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,920
in a general sense unless they really

257
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,360
concentrate bacterium is an individual

258
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,360
bacteria

259
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,240
bacteria

260
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,720
are the population of bacteria so the

261
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,959
way i like to to look at it when most

262
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,839
people think about bacteria

263
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,559
they are thinking about their car in the

264
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,959
driveway that car is the bacteria no

265
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,838
that's the bacterium when you say

266
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,439
bacteria you're thinking about the the

267
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,920
parking lot at the atlantic uh you know

268
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,800
the atlanta airport uh you know

269
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:46,319
thousands and thousands and thousands so

270
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:49,679
so those two concepts are key and and we

271
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,519
often slip into talking about bacteria

272
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,958
there's hardly ever a a bacterium uh

273
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,240
it's just one of those things they

274
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:01,119
multiply every 20 minutes and

275
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,278
there are so many of them that even when

276
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,200
you're talking about an individual kind

277
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,000
of bacterium

278
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,240
you're really talking about bacteria

279
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
and what i like to tell people to do and

280
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,278
it's one of those things that i wasn't

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,920
able to do in the book

282
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:21,600
if you google bacteria on the on a

283
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:24,240
needle uh you'll end up with a picture

284
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,079
of bacteria on the tip of a needle and

285
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,600
it's it's just a mind blower i didn't

286
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,159
want to pay for the picture to put it in

287
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,800
the book uh so so i'm just telling you

288
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:35,199
about it now unbelievable

289
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,199
how small they are and how many they are

290
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,040
and so so really what we're talking

291
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
about when we when we

292
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,838
we're talking here we're talking about

293
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,000
bacteria multiples uh even though we

294
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,320
refer to bacterium

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,320
to describe the individual and what its

296
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,320
parts do etcetera etcetera you never see

297
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,720
an individual you always see the

298
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,360
population great so let's let's push a

299
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,360
little more on that size uh aspect of it

300
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,879
because um uh

301
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,480
you know some of the examples that you

302
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,679
give um

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,839
in the book of how small an individual

304
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,599
bacterium is it's it's really remarkable

305
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,360
where you know you know a head of a

306
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,920
needle is going to have thousands of

307
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,839
them which which really tells me that

308
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,879
that this is an organism that we're

309
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,440
going to be interacting with um in in

310
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,480
the huge numbers

311
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,480
yeah uh the you know they're uh two

312
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,159
0.2 micrometers

313
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,000
i think the example i give in the book

314
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,838
is is that if you

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
first of all if you look at a human hair

316
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,160
human hair is about uh

317
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,799
18 to 180 micrometers uh so you they're

318
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,439
really small obviously but but if you

319
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:48,000
made a bacterium

320
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,040
the size of a spruce bark beetle or a

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,759
bark beetle and you and and the the tree

322
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,078
itself uh you know was the normal size

323
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,759
that's sort of what you're looking at

324
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:01,439
you know the hair versus the little

325
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,319
teeny they're teeny god they're small uh

326
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,160
and and uh

327
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,278
they're just they're just hard to

328
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:11,759
conceive of they're so small so so what

329
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,600
i tell people is they're so small

330
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,759
uh but there are so many of them that

331
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,839
when you drop that frito

332
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,000
or that dorito chip on the floor don't

333
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,920
believe in the in the in the two second

334
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
rule uh they're on it right away

335
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,399
instantly

336
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,600
right right exactly so we'll be talking

337
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,720
um um again and again over the course of

338
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,200
the episode about uh bacteria and and

339
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,720
using water and moisture as a tool in

340
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,440
different ways but um but categorically

341
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,320
you know bacteria require moisture to

342
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,160
create their mucilage they used to move

343
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,839
and to grab passing nutrition and

344
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,078
microbes

345
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,040
does this suggest that a bacteria is

346
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:55,838
more part of the water food web instead

347
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,679
of the soil food web

348
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,720
well you know i don't really think of it

349
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,159
that way all soil particles have a

350
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,200
microscopic

351
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,360
coating of moisture around them uh and

352
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,759
and so it's a natural environment for

353
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,600
bacteria to live in uh and to move

354
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,759
around it now of course remember they

355
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,320
don't move very far uh or they don't

356
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:20,240
have to move very far um but they're

357
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,320
very very small uh and so you know the

358
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,480
whole dynamics of how they move about

359
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,399
and and and what they do as they move

360
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,000
about just absolutely fascinating but

361
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,159
but that water

362
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,120
level in the soil it's there it's in

363
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,559
your compost in your firm vermicompost

364
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
and of course inside plants there's

365
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,239
plenty of water

366
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
but i consider it to be you know

367
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,959
attached to the soil food web

368
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,159
great

369
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,679
so if bacteria require water to be

370
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,159
mobile

371
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,000
what is the mechanism they use to move

372
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,919
around in my mind i imagine like

373
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,198
something like ores

374
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,799
right and of course if they're so small

375
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,599
and this is something very hard for us

376
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,919
to conceive they're so small that they

377
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,480
that they can't use something like ores

378
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,599
they're they're they're the dynamics of

379
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,079
fluid at that little at that size level

380
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,159
is completely messed up uh and so if

381
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,679
they used ores they would just sort of

382
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,679
spin around they wouldn't they wouldn't

383
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,319
go anywhere so they've developed this

384
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:21,278
wonderful mechanism uh they have these

385
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,480
flagellums these these uh propellers

386
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:27,519
literally motors uh and they use about

387
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,320
ten percent of their of their proteins

388
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,078
to to produce these guys and they spin

389
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,639
around these little little motors they

390
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:38,399
have they they rotate about a a a

391
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,399
thousand times uh a a a second it's

392
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,958
unbelievable i mean it's just incredible

393
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,360
how fast they move and uh and and how

394
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,439
much energy they taken and depending on

395
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,440
what kind of bacteria

396
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
it is they have them on the ends they

397
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,800
could have them in the middle they can

398
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,278
have thousands of them or they can have

399
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,198
one of them uh and and they've developed

400
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,759
this ability to be able to use this

401
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,359
propeller motion to move through this

402
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,919
fluid this

403
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
sort of jello to them uh you know you

404
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,039
can imagine that if you were in a

405
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,519
swimming pool full of

406
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,000
liquid of solidifying jello how

407
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,679
difficult it would be to move uh well

408
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
that's that's the problem they face and

409
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,958
that's why they've developed these

410
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,639
unbelievable motors and when you look at

411
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:23,119
the pictures of them they are motors

412
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,560
you have to sort of pinch yourself

413
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
unbelievable what we can see with

414
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:30,159
microscopes these days and they and they

415
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,039
rotate 6 000 rpms you know rotations per

416
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,198
minute holy crow uh if you did that with

417
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,719
your car engine it wouldn't last very

418
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,359
long so they're they're pretty

419
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,000
incredible um and they and they develop

420
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,159
these protons uh you know they use these

421
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,399
protons which they to to move these

422
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,719
things ah it's just they're unbelievable

423
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,440
unbelievable so you mentioned all the

424
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,160
variety of mobility mechanisms that the

425
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,720
different varieties of bacteria have and

426
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,600
we've got an idea of how small they are

427
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,759
can you give us an idea of of um how

428
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,360
numerous the varieties are i mean i can

429
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,120
imagine there's so many on the planet

430
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,079
that we're still finding new ones all

431
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,198
the time but do we have any sense of of

432
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,519
of their numbers on on the planet

433
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,359
not not really

434
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,959
i mean they're discovering new ones all

435
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,039
the time i just read an article today

436
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,879
that they wandered into some cave in

437
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,399
hawaii and discovered a thousand

438
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,320
different bacterium they've never seen

439
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,078
before so they're they're they're you

440
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
know it's it's pretty incredible now i

441
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:28,559
will say that i

442
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,199
i read

443
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,638
studies that indicate that in soil is

444
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:37,039
kind of a kind of a set amount and kinds

445
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,360
of bacterium in soil uh that's pretty

446
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,639
pretty much similar all around the world

447
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,959
um

448
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,959
you know it's the the plant can pick

449
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,758
from that what they need with the with

450
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,919
the exudates but uh but bacteria you

451
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,440
know they're they're just so plentiful

452
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,278
in so many different kinds and they have

453
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,040
the ability to be able to transfer dna

454
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,759
as they're going about their daily lives

455
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:03,278
to make subspecies and and and you know

456
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:07,360
it's really easy for them to change

457
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,558
by by transferring chromosomes and

458
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,000
you know it's just

459
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,439
they're amazing

460
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,119
well it's funny it's almost like you're

461
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,439
reading my notes because that is my next

462
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,719
question you know i uh you know i know

463
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,079
there's not boys and girls uh uh in

464
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,959
bacteria um so so will you explain to us

465
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,599
um both how they reproduce and how they

466
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,960
transfer their dna because you know with

467
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,000
with them

468
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,200
reproducing doubling in number every 20

469
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,839
minutes there's so much opportunity for

470
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,640
the passing of dna and evolution they

471
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,079
must they must evolve so fast

472
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,520
yeah they do i mean and there's two

473
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,639
different ways they do it i mean what

474
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,000
when they divide to multiply there's a

475
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,160
there's a

476
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,679
quasi nucleus that's not the right term

477
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,558
that can be contains uh chromosomes uh

478
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
uh

479
00:17:54,558 --> 00:18:01,038
the the plasmid and it it divides itself

480
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,600
uh and sometimes some some of the

481
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,319
chromosomes leak out of that plasmid as

482
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,240
it's as it's dividing and is floating

483
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,759
around out there free and gets involved

484
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,240
in another bacterium uh and sometimes

485
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,279
two bacteria will back up next to each

486
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,880
other put out this little plank way and

487
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,798
transfer a couple of little dnas wow

488
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,200
and then of course it must occur that

489
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,798
occasionally one bacterium eats another

490
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
bacterium

491
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,679
and and absorbs some of that dna into

492
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,439
its plasmid and and becomes a slightly

493
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,600
different kind of bacterium so they're

494
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,240
yeah they change all the time that's

495
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,399
interesting there's not really like a

496
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,200
uh what i want to say like a like a

497
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,679
carrier right like in right in mammals

498
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,600
you'll get like you know the the seminal

499
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,480
fluid that is holding the packages which

500
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,199
then have the dna and we're talking

501
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,798
about a level of biology that is that is

502
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,880
so basic

503
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,720
that they are they it's just the

504
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
transfer of the

505
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,400
of the dna itself i caught i caught

506
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,280
three different three different

507
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,240
varieties that you mentioned um one when

508
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,918
they when they one separates into two

509
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,519
and there's a little bit of accidental

510
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:18,000
leakage um that's one the the second one

511
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,400
being where one eats another

512
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,079
and then the third one where one pokes

513
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,240
another and um right and so

514
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,079
even the fact that there are multiple

515
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,319
ways that it happens

516
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,399
um tells me that there's

517
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,519
there's there's constantly

518
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,080
so many

519
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,960
variables every time

520
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,839
um

521
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,279
there's a new i don't know generation

522
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,279
right which is why they can live in so

523
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,038
many different kinds of environments uh

524
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,319
it's also why we have bacterial

525
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:51,359
resistance and you know after a while uh

526
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,279
you know they they outsmart us and so so

527
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,759
so yeah and they're just think they're

528
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,839
incredible and and i think we we

529
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,519
we've talked before we don't study them

530
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,839
in school because they're too damn small

531
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,240
for people to look at instead we study

532
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,959
dinosaurs which are too you know too

533
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,480
extinct really to be of any use so i

534
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,120
wish we were studying bacterium and

535
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,759
doing more microbiology in school and

536
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,839
and actually uh you know at home

537
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,599
preschool uh you know with the plush

538
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,279
toys and stuff as we've talked about i

539
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,519
mean you know little kids know their

540
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,079
bacterium names no but they do know a

541
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,000
dinosaur name well all the bacterium is

542
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,399
still here the bad you know i don't get

543
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,200
it but that's just me

544
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,360
so um so how do these bacteria talk to

545
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,159
each other because they very much appear

546
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,918
to cooperate with each other

547
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,240
right and they can put chemicals out

548
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,880
into the into the uh

549
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,200
soil uh when those chemicals reach the

550
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,559
right concentration uh they can cause

551
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,798
the entire group of bacteria that act in

552
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,879
you know in particular ways so there's

553
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,759
there's a sensing they have uh that

554
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,000
they're able to do uh now they also can

555
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,839
obviously talk individually to each

556
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,038
other but but it's the quorum sensing

557
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,720
that that people know bacterium for uh

558
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,960
so an individual bacteria might be

559
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,880
swimming around having a nice happy day

560
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,840
uh and then all of a sudden it starts to

561
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,720
pick up this this

562
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,158
you know

563
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,519
for lack of a better word sort of a

564
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,440
pheromone

565
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,200
as do all the other bacterium that are

566
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,240
around it including the ones that you

567
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
know that were

568
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,558
their mother and father 20 minutes ago

569
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,919
uh and all of a sudden they act they act

570
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,759
the same way and they fly in the same

571
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,440
direction or the you know they move they

572
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,279
they attack the same thing whatever

573
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,120
whatever whatever it happens to be

574
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,879
that's going on they all do it at once

575
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,639
because there's little sensing signals

576
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,960
out there in the environment

577
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,919
i can imagine that's uh quite an

578
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,279
impressive moment when you're looking at

579
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,880
you know

580
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,839
it's probably really hard to look at one

581
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,440
single

582
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,359
bacterium so you're probably seeing

583
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,519
looking at like a small group

584
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,519
and oh nobody but but it isn't difficult

585
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,240
to see one anymore it was when we you

586
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,158
and i went to school uh and it probably

587
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,400
is today in normal high schools because

588
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,320
they don't have the machinery but oh my

589
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,038
goodness gracious i mean we can now see

590
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,519
individual strains of dna

591
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,759
uh and so so yeah we can we can see

592
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,279
individual bacterium and in fact

593
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,319
later on on the show we'll we'll talk

594
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,678
about about the the the bacteria that go

595
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,599
into plants

596
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,360
and and the pictures that are in the

597
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,719
book uh are phenomenal i mean my god

598
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,279
whoo

599
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,400
that moment of watching um you know a

600
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:31,038
bacterium um and then watch it you know

601
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,759
start to be surrounded by other bacteria

602
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,200
and then that moment where

603
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,279
i mean i'm assuming that there's this

604
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,240
moment of shift where i as of the

605
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,319
observer i see them just milling around

606
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,480
and then suddenly i can tell they've

607
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,319
started to coordinate it's it's almost

608
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,319
like you know not that anthropomorphized

609
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,558
too much but it's almost like like a

610
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,639
moment of them gaining intelligence

611
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,918
because of the quorum sensing

612
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,440
exactly exactly you know or or because

613
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,440
you know me i mean in the back of

614
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,038
teaming with nutrients i sort of i sort

615
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
of laid out my philosophy that we're

616
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,119
just you know we're it's the dandelion

617
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,880
theory of life that we're just you know

618
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,319
we're horton here's the who we're the

619
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
little people and there's a bigger

620
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,678
people and you know there's another

621
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
bigger dandelion

622
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,440
i mean you know these bacteria we're

623
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,199
just bacteria perhaps you know and and

624
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,960
weak worm sense you know i'm gonna vote

625
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
for so and so you know all the group

626
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,000
gets together and they vote for so and

627
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,079
so you

628
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,558
it's like quorum sensing well that idea

629
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,639
that we're all uh bacteria you know

630
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,079
that's that's that's that's barely a

631
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,559
metaphor right because it's there's

632
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,439
actually truism to it i mean so much of

633
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,599
our body is bacterias and microbes and

634
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,000
these life forms that are actually

635
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,038
following their own i guess intent or

636
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,759
plan if you will um and and yet you know

637
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:48,400
i think of it as they make up my body

638
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,440
but actually my body is only like about

639
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,200
30 percent unique to me and the other 70

640
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,278
are all these living life forms that

641
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,798
that my body is somehow coordinating

642
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:58,960
that's trippy

643
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,079
yeah and what gets even more trippy is

644
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,558
that some of the things that have you

645
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,480
know we always talk about the the soil

646
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,960
food web app operating like the stomach

647
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,839
you know the soil's big big stomach

648
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,360
digesting stuff and uh oh my god what

649
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,199
happens in the stomach and what happens

650
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,599
in res fashion which we're going to talk

651
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,759
about uh it's unbelievable how similar

652
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,359
they are so so yeah these bacteria

653
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,278
control us and when you have a bad

654
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,918
bacteria you get sick

655
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,839
uh and and you've got some good bacteria

656
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,720
that probably take out the bad bacteria

657
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,399
it's just it's phenomenal how how they

658
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,120
operate uh it doesn't matter whether

659
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,679
they're inside you or inside a a plant

660
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,918
uh they are they are controlling lots of

661
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,159
things we have no idea they're doing

662
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,240
so so as we are you know we're kind of

663
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,840
setting up this these generalizations

664
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,319
about bacteria so everybody's kind of

665
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,558
approaching the second set from the same

666
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,480
context so we know how they reproduce

667
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,960
and transfer their dna we've got a kind

668
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,120
of an idea how they talk with each other

669
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,679
um how do like they essentially eat or

670
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,719
acquire nutrients and create energies

671
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,640
for themselves because they you know

672
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,480
they don't have mouths so so what's

673
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
their deal do they do they absorb it or

674
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,000
photosynthesize

675
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,599
well they can do both

676
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,640
there are some yeah there are some

677
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,678
photosynthetic bacteria some aren't uh

678
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,080
there are some that go through

679
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,159
endosymbolios you know they take they

680
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,720
open up and actually

681
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,720
invaginate around what they're eating

682
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,558
and and others absorb it like a plant

683
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,640
absorbs through through channels and

684
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,480
stuff in there through their cell wall

685
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,679
and then into the membrane and then into

686
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,759
the cytoplasm of the of the bacteria

687
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,038
that's uh that's invaginate it's got to

688
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,079
be totally cool word of the day i'm

689
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,319
gonna have to look that up when we're

690
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,918
done here so well it's making you you

691
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,079
know you open up and you and you you're

692
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,720
like kind of surprised

693
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,000
right right yeah yeah um

694
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,759
all right so there's there's lots of

695
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,679
different ways that they get the

696
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,759
nutrients and because there's so much

697
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,038
diff so many different variety of

698
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,278
bacteria

699
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,278
um you know pretty much any way that you

700
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,759
can think about it probably happens in

701
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,919
some bacteria so so there's so much

702
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,798
variety that that we're not going to not

703
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,080
lock that down but so so bacteria are so

704
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,359
small

705
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,359
um that they do influence the macro

706
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,199
world but no let me let me say that

707
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,959
differently bacteria are really small

708
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,480
but they do influence the macro world

709
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,120
do we have any idea of what their

710
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,839
numbers must exist like how many of them

711
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,359
need to get together for them to

712
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,119
influence

713
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,639
levels of magnitude in nature that we

714
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,639
notice it

715
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,159
sure well i think there's probably two

716
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,679
answers to that on both extremes

717
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,840
snowflake

718
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:45,679
on bacterium can cause a snowflake

719
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,278
uh so so very small um uh and yet on the

720
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,798
other hand then we can totally notice it

721
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,960
though we can still try to catch it down

722
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,038
our tongue right yeah exactly and then

723
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,120
you take you take uh you know some

724
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,319
serious diseases which spread out

725
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,798
throughout you know

726
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,798
cause pandemics uh not not the one we're

727
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,879
going through now but i mean so so they

728
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,960
can influence as individuals and as

729
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,520
groups

730
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,960
so um you know

731
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,960
in your first section where i'm learning

732
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,759
more about bacteria

733
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,240
you know some forms of bacteria have no

734
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,558
cell walls and i don't understand how

735
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,440
that could be because in you know in my

736
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,519
only you know high school biology um

737
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,679
everything has cells walls that's how

738
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,519
everything stays inside and like holds

739
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,840
it together in nature how can some

740
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,599
bacteria not have cell walls

741
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,959
well it's it's uh

742
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,558
these are called l forms um

743
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,240
and oddly enough

744
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,519
the term comes from the name of the

745
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,480
school where they were identified some

746
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,119
london school so they used l l forms and

747
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,159
these are bacteria that don't have uh

748
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,839
cell walls and uh in our story we'll

749
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,399
talk about one way that they get that

750
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,678
way but the there's still a membrane so

751
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,639
what you've got when you look at the

752
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,559
bacteria is you have a cell wall same

753
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,038
thing with a plant then you've got a

754
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:06,079
little space and then you've got a

755
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,679
membrane and and so things have to go

756
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,558
through the cell wall then they have to

757
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,360
go into through the membrane to get into

758
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,558
the

759
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,319
the the goods the soup the cytoplasm of

760
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,200
the of the bacteria the same thing with

761
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,038
the plant um and so you've you've you've

762
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,278
got the ability for

763
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,240
uh this the

764
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:29,679
insides of the bacteria to stay

765
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,200
connected just by that membrane in in

766
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,720
you know unless they're really getting

767
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,720
roughed up

768
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,120
i think they can rupture obviously yeah

769
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,360
yeah so they so so in my picturing that

770
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,918
they have no cell walls it's not that

771
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,439
they don't have a dividing wall it's

772
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,240
actually a membrane it's just not

773
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,240
something as serious as a cell wall so

774
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,640
so those bacteria would probably be more

775
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,319
fragile but they still have enough

776
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,278
membrane to like hold their lives

777
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,359
together

778
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,960
right and then but they might leak a

779
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,479
little bit

780
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,000
you know what i the example you might

781
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,519
want to think about is somebody mails

782
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,839
you a box with a blown up balloon in it

783
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,558
you open it up you take the balloon out

784
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,079
uh the cell wall was the box and now

785
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,158
you've got that balloon well if you're

786
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,918
not careful it's going to pop in the box

787
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,880
it wouldn't have popped that's a great

788
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,080
example

789
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,039
um

790
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,639
so i got to tell you jeff it's so um and

791
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,278
so encouraging

792
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,038
to have you back on as a guest because

793
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,359
you know this is there's we have a lot

794
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:32,398
of information to go through today and

795
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:35,199
um uh you are such a as a snappy and

796
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,199
excited and get the words out and get to

797
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,038
your point guessed like this is the only

798
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,278
way we were gonna do this like like

799
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,599
we're moving through at such a pleasant

800
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,839
pace that like i can almost feel like

801
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,599
information falling out of people's ears

802
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,959
and um and we're actually going to be

803
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:51,038
able to get through it everything in

804
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,200
like a you know a realistic time instead

805
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,759
of like a four or five hour show so it's

806
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,319
it's nice to be around your enthusiasm

807
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,640
so i i appreciate that so let's let's

808
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,960
move on a little bit um so we we've hit

809
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,840
a lit a lot about like generalized

810
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,440
bacteria but i want to start uh

811
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,240
grounding some of this uh in cannabis

812
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,159
so

813
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,240
um and we're going to start by talking a

814
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:18,080
little bit about bacteria and seeds um

815
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,440
when we go to the second set we're going

816
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,798
to go in depth about the rhizophage

817
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,320
cycle and that's going to be our our

818
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:29,119
biggest set today um but i want to

819
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,918
ground our conversation in cannabis

820
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:35,038
since that's the nature of the show um

821
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,320
so cannabis plants have a relationship

822
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,960
with bacteria at every step of the life

823
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,678
and and i was really surprised to learn

824
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,360
that there's there's even bacteria in

825
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,200
the seed that um you know is is is put

826
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,038
into the seed as it's growing and then

827
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,360
it's it's sitting there in weight as

828
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,038
it's waiting in our refrigerator and

829
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,439
then when it's given the right

830
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,839
conditions it is it's you know told all

831
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,240
right time to do your job so will you

832
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,720
walk us through the relationship between

833
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,480
bacteria and cannabis seeds

834
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,038
sure this is a good time to introduce

835
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,480
the concept of endophytes

836
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:14,398
endophytes are are

837
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,278
microorganisms that live inside a plant

838
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,518
for at least part of their life

839
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,880
and and sometimes contribute to the

840
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,038
plant sometimes they harden the plant

841
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,960
but they live part of their life inside

842
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,839
the plant now

843
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,079
there are all manner of bacteria as

844
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,278
we'll talk later on they get into a

845
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,798
plant

846
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,480
and they can get into a plant through

847
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,759
little cracks in the root and they can

848
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,720
get into the plant uh airborne get blown

849
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:43,278
onto the onto the plant and

850
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,480
maybe get blown onto a flower but what

851
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,720
happens is when a flower is formed and

852
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,240
the seeds are being formed if you sort

853
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,038
of sort of imagine it it's like an open

854
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,960
the palm of your hand is the flower and

855
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,398
you've got bacteria

856
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,360
in the palm your hand closes up and

857
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,959
those bacteria end up inside the seed

858
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,639
your fist

859
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,319
does that make sense it does so those

860
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,759
bacteria are in there those are

861
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:15,678
endophytic bacteria and all seeds have

862
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:18,158
bacteria in them endophytes and usually

863
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,278
i don't know maybe a hundred million

864
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,080
seeds a hundred million bacteria in in a

865
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,759
seed that might be a high end uh

866
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,199
many different kinds depending on what

867
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:32,640
kind of seed it is and these

868
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,080
are in the in the seed when the seed

869
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,720
germinates

870
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,319
they are released or they come out of

871
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,720
their dormancy

872
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:44,000
and they either go into the plant or

873
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,519
they go most of them into the soil so

874
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,519
these become

875
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,558
your rhizo

876
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,319
bacterium they add to the bacteria that

877
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,480
are already in the soil but these are

878
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:57,759
specific bacteria

879
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,399
carried by that seed

880
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,000
and then deposited in the soil

881
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,678
for what purpose

882
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,278
obviously the seed the plant that grows

883
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,759
from that seed

884
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,759
uses those bacterium

885
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,480
and those bacteria

886
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,119
to

887
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,159
to do something beneficial for that

888
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,839
plant

889
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,278
it's like the seeds bringing its own

890
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,319
bagged lunch

891
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:25,200
exactly right exactly right and it turns

892
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,038
out with cannabis that it's bringing

893
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,038
specific kind now let's just for a

894
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,599
second get away from cannabis one of the

895
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:34,158
one of the studies done uh that i read

896
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,879
was of corn you know corn has changed

897
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,640
over the 400 years that you know in the

898
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,640
new world we've we've been breeding it

899
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,120
et cetera et cetera but it turns out

900
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,720
that the original corn if you plant it

901
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:50,158
today it has the same bacteria in it

902
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,960
that it had back 400 years ago holy crow

903
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,679
uh no it's just amazing and so it turns

904
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,278
out that cannabis carry their own

905
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,080
specific

906
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,119
desired bacteria so that's the first

907
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,599
lesson

908
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,918
uh and and when we're dealing with seeds

909
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,719
we want to be very very careful so

910
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,200
obviously the one thing you do not want

911
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:14,959
to do with your cannabis seeds anymore

912
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,799
is sterilize them which many people do

913
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,720
i don't think they're fully capable of

914
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,359
completely sterilizing them but many

915
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,918
people use hydrogen peroxide etc to

916
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,719
sterilize the seed you don't want to do

917
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,078
that you want every single bacterium

918
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,319
that seed has

919
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,639
uh living and doing something in that

920
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,760
soil well it's become incredibly common

921
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,200
for people to use a 70 30 mix of water

922
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,000
and h2o2 with the idea that it is adding

923
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:45,918
more you know oxygen to the situation

924
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,440
are you suggesting that the the h2o2 in

925
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,878
that blend is wiping bacteria from the

926
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,639
seed

927
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,480
yeah i think it might be

928
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,000
um obviously we've got to do a lot more

929
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,920
research but but it certainly makes

930
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
sense to me that it is and that when the

931
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,320
seed germinates so there's still some of

932
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,920
the h2o2 that kills some of the

933
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,680
bacterium so

934
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,920
or impacts the bacterium one way or the

935
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,679
other uh so yeah i think we got to be

936
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,000
very very careful about

937
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:14,078
about that by the same token

938
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,960
a lot of people start their seeds in

939
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,960
towels paper towels you know you put the

940
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,920
seed in you wet the paper towel you fold

941
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,519
it

942
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,119
and then the seed grows and then you

943
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,960
take it carefully with the tweezer and

944
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,440
you put it back you put it in the soil

945
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,358
wait a minute doesn't it make sense that

946
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,000
that paper towel contains a lot of

947
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,159
bacteria that you may want bury the

948
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,400
paper towel too

949
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,440
that makes practical advice practical

950
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,039
advice

951
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,880
and so many people you know if you leave

952
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,119
your if you leave your seat in the paper

953
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,160
towel an extra day

954
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,880
a lot of the time the the your most

955
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,199
important new root hairs will have

956
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,039
bonded with the paper towel

957
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,199
and so you know i've been in this heck i

958
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,599
was in that situation this spring where

959
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,279
where i pull i pulled it you know it had

960
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,280
attached and i gave it a little tug and

961
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,920
i separated you know what's going to

962
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,760
become the tap root from the paper towel

963
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,760
and you know i it didn't feel good when

964
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,680
i did it i'm like ooh i ripped root

965
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,680
hairs but now now after reading your

966
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:16,799
book um i understand profoundly how

967
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:19,118
important all those early root hairs are

968
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,880
and um i want to be far more careful now

969
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,559
and and i'm more likely just to you know

970
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,720
cut that area of the paper towel out and

971
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,599
and plant it with the whole thing

972
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,679
right

973
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,559
right exactly exactly which will work

974
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,559
just fine uh yeah so it's the seed

975
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,199
carries these wonderful things and and

976
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,639
and what we've discovered with cannabis

977
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,439
in particular

978
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,759
is that the bacteria in the soil around

979
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,000
the cannabis plant is generally

980
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,160
one cannabis plant and another cannabis

981
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,920
plant is pretty much the same

982
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,279
what happens is the plant and we're

983
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,680
going to talk about this obviously in

984
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,200
the next segment it's razor fashion

985
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,319
the plant takes up some of these

986
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,759
bacterium and depending on the

987
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,720
the the

988
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,400
type of cannabis you're growing it takes

989
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,838
up specific

990
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,400
endophytes

991
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,119
so your durban poison takes up

992
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:13,039
one set of bacterium endophytes

993
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,680
and your you know your lemon og

994
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:19,838
takes up another kind now we've always

995
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,838
talked in cannabis about tawar

996
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,879
now maybe we're getting into a slightly

997
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,640
different maybe it's not called tawar

998
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,119
anymore but the bacterium impacts the

999
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,799
cannabis in ways

1000
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,800
you know we are now

1001
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,480
just getting our eyes open down i mean

1002
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,680
there's no question

1003
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,838
that that your cannabis is influenced by

1004
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,199
the type of endophytes that it has

1005
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:44,719
inside it

1006
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,358
um

1007
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:51,679
in your book you also lay out that

1008
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:55,598
different seeds even of the same variety

1009
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,118
and from the same seed making experience

1010
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,519
will have

1011
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,039
different bacteria in the different

1012
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,320
seeds and so

1013
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,639
even if

1014
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,920
you are you know intending that your

1015
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,960
seeds be

1016
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,000
you know

1017
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,679
identical i'll use that term loosely um

1018
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,400
that that even if you had the genetics

1019
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:19,039
all exactly the same between two seeds

1020
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,960
and they were actually identical the

1021
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:27,358
fact that they are encapsulating

1022
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:30,880
different blends of bacteria means that

1023
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:33,759
that bacteria is going to influence how

1024
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,599
the plant grows in the environment and i

1025
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,079
know this is incorrect usage of the

1026
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,280
vocabulary but it reminds me a lot of

1027
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,119
how the the scene thinks of uh phenos

1028
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,880
right like oh you know you got the same

1029
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,519
seed but you got different phenos of

1030
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,838
that seed right and so right so it seems

1031
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,239
to me that that that is an interesting

1032
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,039
thing for cannabis cultivators to be

1033
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,759
aware of um when we're trying to judge

1034
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,759
the quality of seeds sometimes the seed

1035
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,119
can be produced perfectly

1036
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,680
appropriately

1037
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,920
and part of it being appropriately made

1038
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:07,759
is that different seeds in the same run

1039
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,400
are actually going to have different

1040
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,480
bacteria and therefore

1041
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,200
are going to start the plant off on a

1042
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,039
different path on a different footing

1043
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,598
right right yeah you can't have you

1044
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,279
can't help but have that happen um but

1045
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,720
by the same token

1046
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,280
uh you know your your strain

1047
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,959
should contain the same endophytes uh

1048
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,400
you know time and time and time again

1049
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,358
which is

1050
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,000
uh

1051
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:37,920
very interesting and and we know

1052
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,559
we know that when you use when you again

1053
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,039
we're sort of overlapping when you use

1054
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:46,239
nitrogen fertilizers

1055
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,880
you reduce the number of bacteria in the

1056
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,039
rhizosphere that go into the plant that

1057
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,720
influence the plant's terpene content

1058
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:56,880
and flavonoids etc etc so and when you

1059
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,959
increase the amount of bacteria that you

1060
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,559
put in the plant versus nitrogen

1061
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,240
fertilizer

1062
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,199
you end up with higher terpenes

1063
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:09,439
flavonoids etc etc so so

1064
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:13,679
all of this bacteria talk

1065
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:16,240
validity validity validates the organic

1066
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,519
soil food web system of growing

1067
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,439
um

1068
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,920
you know and then i guess we can go one

1069
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,200
step further

1070
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,838
it also validates not changing your soil

1071
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,719
all the time if you're growing cannabis

1072
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:30,639
uh

1073
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,480
in the soil that's putting it's you know

1074
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,838
it's putting exudates out that are

1075
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,920
concentrating and

1076
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,159
the right kinds of bacteria no sense

1077
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,680
throwing that stuff out plant in it

1078
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:41,118
again

1079
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,279
so you can take advantage of what's

1080
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,880
already happened in it before

1081
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,800
so dear listener if you're listening and

1082
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,800
you're like oh my gosh shango ask more

1083
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,880
follow-up questions on this we will get

1084
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,800
to that in the third set specifically

1085
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,599
how the bacteria

1086
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,119
can be leveraged in your um in your

1087
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,800
cultivation environment but for now

1088
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,318
we're going to move on so

1089
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,560
um you know

1090
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:05,599
reading your description of seed

1091
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,679
germination uh the root cap that that

1092
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,599
protects the radical the mucilage

1093
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,078
produced by the seed to lubricate the

1094
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,880
area of soil around the seed and how

1095
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,359
that mucilage is used to bind microbes

1096
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,240
to the root while attracting phosphorus

1097
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:23,759
zinc iron magnesium it makes me realize

1098
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:28,159
that as cultivators we should really be

1099
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,400
careful and and resist moving the seed

1100
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,719
once we've placed it in the soil you

1101
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,680
know yes they're hearty and like seeds

1102
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:38,959
pop you know and and survive

1103
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:42,960
in crazy situations but there's so much

1104
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,720
subtle biology going on as soon as

1105
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,240
the um

1106
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:49,279
as soon as you're triggering the

1107
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:52,239
germination that i can now see how

1108
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,920
important it is to not disturb the seeds

1109
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:55,838
and i think that like with this

1110
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,000
understanding i'm going to increase my

1111
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,799
germination rates because i have a i

1112
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,960
have a tendency to to like move seeds

1113
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,400
and move the soil around it to like you

1114
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,199
know you know

1115
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,280
help it get more sun exposure or

1116
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:12,559
or like oh i watered it and like you

1117
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,400
know it got recovered and i really think

1118
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,880
now i understand that it's important to

1119
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,400
just like don't be touching the seed

1120
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,400
after you've started the process

1121
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,559
right right yeah it's you know let the

1122
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,639
plant

1123
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,000
i've always said the plant's in control

1124
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:29,118
you know that's what i learned from dr

1125
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,039
elaine and

1126
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,800
there's no reason why a cannabis plant

1127
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,599
shouldn't be in control as well all

1128
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,960
right all right so um let's uh let's go

1129
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,838
ahead and take our first commercial

1130
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,679
break uh we are probably mostly here for

1131
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,159
the rhizophagia cycle and so we're gonna

1132
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,519
leave most of the time for that next so

1133
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,358
we're gonna take our short break and be

1134
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,119
right back you are listening to shaping

1135
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,039
fire and my guest today is jeff

1136
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,960
lowenfels you know without these

1137
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,039
advertisers shaping fire would not

1138
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,480
happen so please support them and let

1139
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,480
them know you heard them on shaping fire

1140
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,920
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1141
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,760
growing is so valued by farmers is

1142
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,920
because the mycelium networks in the

1143
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,480
soil remain established from year to

1144
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,159
year and we know these fungal networks

1145
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,559
are essential because they are the

1146
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,719
nutrient super highways that extend far

1147
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,358
and wide in the substrate to feed your

1148
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:22,078
plants the trouble with growing in new

1149
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:24,000
living soils or blended cocoa substrates

1150
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,400
is that it takes most of the plant's

1151
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,920
life just to create these mycelium

1152
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,960
highways

1153
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,039
dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1154
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,079
reduces that time and gets your plant

1155
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,079
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1156
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,480
and it's three times the concentration

1292
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,559
uh before the break we were talking you

1293
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,440
know more generally about uh bacteria um

1294
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,119
as an organism as uh something that we

1295
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,679
interact with every day in our lives but

1296
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,318
almost never think about and unless we

1297
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:10,799
get sick and then um and then we started

1298
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:13,679
uh bringing that home to the cannabis

1299
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,519
plant itself um kind of like at the

1300
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,440
beginning of this cycle that we're going

1301
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,119
to be talking about this entire set the

1302
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,599
rio the rhizophagia cycle and and i see

1303
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,000
this cycle as starting with the seed as

1304
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,838
far as like the plants uh living cycle

1305
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,880
goes it starts with the seed because

1306
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:33,759
when we germinate the seed it brings

1307
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,318
along with it the essential bacteria

1308
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,160
that it's going to need to grow which is

1309
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,239
like totally cool and amazing in and of

1310
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,879
itself but also

1311
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:46,479
you know really useful to know as a

1312
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,640
grower so um you know

1313
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,318
i kind of want to back into this topic

1314
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:53,358
jeff because you know usually in an

1315
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:55,759
interview i'd ask successive small

1316
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:58,159
questions to paint a bigger picture

1317
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,359
slowly making the picture bigger but

1318
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,920
we're going to

1319
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,759
discuss rhizophages cycle and i really

1320
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,960
think that before we talk about the

1321
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,640
details of you know you know the the

1322
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,440
roots and the uptake and all the stuff

1323
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:14,159
in specific we really should grok

1324
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,200
what the rhizophages cycle is itself in

1325
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,480
total

1326
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,919
um before we go into the details so um i

1327
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,079
want to do something for the first time

1328
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,318
i'd like to read a paragraph from your

1329
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,680
book just a couple of sentences and and

1330
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,079
then i'll hand the mic to you to

1331
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,639
meticulously walk us through it in more

1332
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,480
detail right but but this this like

1333
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,118
whatever it is four sentences in your

1334
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,838
book right just nailed it so well for me

1335
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,440
after i read all the details that um i'm

1336
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:41,199
like oh this is beautiful so here here

1337
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,000
it is friends

1338
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,879
under the new model of the soil food web

1339
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,719
plants still farm the soil but they

1340
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,680
maintain flocks of bacteria too

1341
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:56,879
these are rounded up and corralled just

1342
00:50:53,679 --> 00:51:00,318
inside the root meristem cell walls

1343
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:03,760
there the bacterial walls are shorn off

1344
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:07,199
and absorbed by the plant as nutrients

1345
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,680
in response the bacteria produce nitric

1346
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:12,159
oxide to protect themselves this is a

1347
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,358
further boon supplying the plant with

1348
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:15,679
nitrogen

1349
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,039
then the plant causes the bacteria to

1350
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:20,159
multiply

1351
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:22,400
finally the plant grows a root hair and

1352
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,318
puts the flock of bacteria back out to

1353
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,440
pasture to get ready for the next

1354
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:29,679
season's shearing so this example

1355
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,039
end of quote um so this example that you

1356
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:34,639
give of bacteria being like sheep really

1357
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:37,039
simplifies it to the point that i

1358
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:38,879
understand that that the bacteria are

1359
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,920
going to enter the plant through their

1360
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,240
roots and then be put back out to

1361
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,800
pasture through the roots as well and

1362
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,519
and this is wonderfully oversimplified

1363
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,160
but

1364
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,400
i think that having that out in

1365
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:55,440
everybody's ears first

1366
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,358
will will help them listen

1367
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:01,200
and make more sense about where you're

1368
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:02,639
about to go so um uh i am sure that you

1369
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,399
have uh

1370
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:07,279
you've got a way to explain this is like

1371
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,720
a beautiful package so so at this point

1372
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,480
i'm going to hand you the mic i know

1373
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:12,719
this is going to be a pretty long answer

1374
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,960
to the question but why don't you just

1375
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:20,239
walk us through the rhizophegi cycle um

1376
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,920
uh in in its in its main framework and

1377
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:24,078
then and then when you kind of get to

1378
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,159
the end to it we'll move around to the

1379
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:29,839
the more specific questions

1380
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:32,000
sure okay well let's start with uh our

1381
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:34,318
model of the soil food web the plant

1382
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,400
takes its photosynthetic energy and it

1383
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,800
uses quite a bit of it fifty percent or

1384
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,800
so to produce exudates that drip out

1385
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,440
into the soil that attract bacteria

1386
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,519
fungi the bacteria and fungi as you know

1387
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,240
attract protozoa nematodes who eat the

1388
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:50,400
bacteria and fungi poop out the excess

1389
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:53,358
and all of that excess is in plant

1390
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,838
usable form and it then diffuses into

1391
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:58,159
the plant i call that the diffusion

1392
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:00,078
model of the soil food web it's the

1393
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,719
wonderful research and work that's done

1394
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,559
by dr elaine ingham and others that's

1395
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,598
that's you know given us the concept of

1396
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,839
the soil food web well along comes dr

1397
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,519
james white and this terrific woman in

1398
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,400
australia who made the discovery of

1399
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,960
rhizophage and they discovered that some

1400
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,200
of these bacteria that are congregating

1401
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,760
right there in the rhizosphere they're

1402
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,199
living in there right at the root tip

1403
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,040
there right right as you say in that

1404
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,639
little sloughed off area where the

1405
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,519
sluffed off cells are coming out of the

1406
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:33,118
root tip as it grows and and all of a

1407
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:35,759
sudden some of them smell this butyric

1408
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,559
acid buttery smell and they back up

1409
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,720
against the the cell wall i mean the

1410
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,440
root wall right there in the meristem of

1411
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:46,078
the root these brand new cells that are

1412
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,639
being formed they have very thin cell

1413
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,760
walls they they aren't differentiated in

1414
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:53,039
any way

1415
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,520
and there are a colony of bacteria

1416
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:59,119
sitting right there against the

1417
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:00,318
cell wall of these root cells and

1418
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,960
some of them

1419
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,759
produce ethylene not some of them they

1420
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:10,000
all produce ethylene which they make

1421
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:13,119
using one of the exudates arginine so

1422
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,199
the plant produces this arginine it

1423
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,480
allows these bacteria to produce

1424
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:20,799
ethylene and this ethylene enables them

1425
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,400
to push through that thin cell wall in

1426
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:26,720
the mirror stem and enter into the space

1427
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,480
between the cell wall the plant cell

1428
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:32,480
wall of the in the root

1429
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,880
and the actual membrane uh that we talk

1430
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,039
about uh you know that that takes that

1431
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,480
has the little channels that nutrients

1432
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,719
go through et cetera so there's a little

1433
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,760
space between that membrane and the cell

1434
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:46,000
wall called a paraplasmic space and in

1435
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:50,319
go these bacterium

1436
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,960
and they become bacteria inside and as

1437
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:56,159
they go in they have this ethylene which

1438
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,318
causes the wall to open up the ethylene

1439
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,358
triggers the plant

1440
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:04,599
to try to defend itself and the plant

1441
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:06,960
does that by spraying something called

1442
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:10,640
nadph i won't give you the scientific

1443
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:15,039
word for it but it sprays super oxide

1444
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:18,558
oxygen superoxide onto the bacteria as

1445
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:19,599
they enter and that superoxide strips

1446
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,519
off

1447
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,680
the cell wall

1448
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:29,119
of the bacteria and that is absorbed by

1449
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,679
the plant as nutrients now it strips

1450
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,200
them off and the bacteria goes wait a

1451
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,480
second i've got to protect myself a

1452
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:39,279
little bit more

1453
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,440
and so it it it produces nitric acid

1454
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,000
and both the nitric acid and the

1455
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,400
ethylene produced create chemical

1456
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,039
reactions that do two things one it

1457
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,559
reduces the power of the superoxide

1458
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,920
turns it into

1459
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:56,480
hydrogen peroxide uh which is a you know

1460
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,159
so it's been antioxidated so to speak

1461
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,400
and and two

1462
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:03,199
uh it it it

1463
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,960
causes the uh uh

1464
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:07,838
the the

1465
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,519
plant to provide a little bit more

1466
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:14,880
carbon to the bacteria so you get this

1467
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:17,280
bacteria that's literally trapped inside

1468
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,798
that little paraplasmic space it's

1469
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,119
getting carbon

1470
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:24,159
from the plant but it's producing

1471
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,200
ethylene and nitric acid and that nitric

1472
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:29,519
acid

1473
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:32,639
turns to nitrate and it is also absorbed

1474
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:35,440
by the plant so the plant has now gotten

1475
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:38,879
the cell wall and nitric

1476
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,760
nitrate out of the bacteria that's in

1477
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,798
this paraplasmic space now inside this

1478
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,119
space there's a current so you have a

1479
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:49,039
circular current inside the cytoplasm

1480
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,720
inside the membrane and inside this

1481
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:54,159
paraplasmic space you also have a

1482
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:56,318
circular current and these bacterium now

1483
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:59,279
bacteria

1484
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:02,000
without cell walls are

1485
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:05,519
moved in a circle in this paraplasmic

1486
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,760
space and as they move the agitation

1487
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:10,159
uh and the fact that they've been in

1488
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,599
there for more than 20 minutes

1489
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,759
causes them

1490
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,920
to reproduce

1491
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:20,480
so they're l forms they don't have cell

1492
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:24,159
walls and they reproduce and they form

1493
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,039
quads and sick templates of bacterium

1494
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,159
walnut bacterium that are circulated

1495
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,358
around

1496
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:31,118
the cell

1497
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,400
and they are producing ethylene the

1498
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,358
whole time they're doing it this

1499
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,838
ethylene is causing the plant again to

1500
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:41,358
provide a little teeny bit of carbon but

1501
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,880
it also causes the plant cell to grow to

1502
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:46,400
elongate

1503
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,480
and after a a couple of days literally

1504
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,880
these things are feeding the plant

1505
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:54,240
producing that nitrogen uh and and and

1506
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,240
they're they're moving around and

1507
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,919
they're multiplying they congregate

1508
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:00,479
their numbers get so large that they

1509
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,639
begin to congregate up against the cell

1510
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,760
wall uh they get caught in a little

1511
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,679
rough spot and as they produce ethylene

1512
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:12,880
in in that group

1513
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:16,078
that ethylene causes a tube to form

1514
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:19,280
off of the root you and i know that tube

1515
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,839
to be a root hair root hairs aren't

1516
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:26,000
separate cells that attach to the root

1517
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:27,759
they're a tube that forms from the cell

1518
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,318
that is in the root

1519
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:33,760
so you've got this tube that forms and

1520
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:37,279
the bacterium uh now bacteria

1521
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,200
that are producing ethylene move into

1522
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,519
that new tube

1523
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,838
and more and more accumulate more

1524
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,838
ethylene is produced there's that that

1525
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:49,519
cycling that goes around and all of a

1526
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:52,318
sudden a little tidal wave of

1527
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:54,079
paraplasmic stuff gel

1528
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,558
it's pushed into that little tube that

1529
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,160
little root forming root here and it

1530
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:03,280
pushes the bacterium out of the tip of

1531
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:06,879
that root hair into the soil where they

1532
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:10,480
coincidentally grow back their cell wall

1533
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,440
and then several days later repeat the

1534
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,719
trip

1535
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,639
through a new mirror stem cell now that

1536
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:19,199
little explosion through that root here

1537
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:22,078
doesn't occur just once there can be

1538
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:24,879
three four or five different explosions

1539
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,720
as that root hair grows now you and i

1540
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,200
have been taught that root hairs are

1541
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,879
there for absorbing nutrients which they

1542
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:32,960
do

1543
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,079
they increase the surface area what 30

1544
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:39,920
percent or so of of the of the of the uh

1545
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:44,880
root uh but they're really there

1546
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,720
to be ejectile uh uh structures to put

1547
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,000
these naked

1548
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:52,159
bacterium l-forms back into the soil

1549
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,159
so that they can pick up more arginine

1550
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,798
pick up more other exudates put their

1551
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:59,279
cell walls back on and go back in again

1552
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:01,838
and feed the plant so they're they're

1553
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,839
trapped in there providing nutrients uh

1554
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:05,599
getting nutrients and then they're back

1555
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:09,039
in the soil fixing themselves up and

1556
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,798
they go back in again uh where their

1557
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,480
wool is sheared

1558
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,880
and then they're put back out into the

1559
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,880
pasture so that they can regrow their

1560
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,200
wool and come back in again and be

1561
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,920
sheared again wow

1562
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,759
it's

1563
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,358
totally mind-blowing

1564
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,200
it is mind-blowing and so and it makes

1565
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:28,798
you wonder so are the bacteria in the

1566
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:31,039
rhizosphere

1567
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:34,079
let's call them are the are they there

1568
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:36,400
because of dr elaine's concept which is

1569
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:39,119
of course the truth or are they there

1570
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,358
because of dr white's concept were they

1571
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:44,000
there first for endo you know for the

1572
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:46,558
rhizophage or were they there first for

1573
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,239
the diffusion model we don't know uh be

1574
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:51,519
you know sort of like a chicken egg

1575
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:55,039
thing uh but it's fascinating uh uh the

1576
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:55,039
same bacteria wow

1577
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,798
could be redundant systems because

1578
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:01,199
nature does that often

1579
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:03,358
that's exactly right uh now it makes

1580
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,879
sense that the bacteria would want to be

1581
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:06,558
inside the root because once they're

1582
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,559
inside their root they have less

1583
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,720
competition they have no predators uh

1584
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,720
they're being fed some carbon by the

1585
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,759
plant internally and nobody nobody else

1586
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:19,439
is eating that carbon uh it's so there's

1587
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,480
reasons why and they're and they're

1588
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:25,599
multiplying like crazy and what what is

1589
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,519
life here for it's to multiply and

1590
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:30,079
propagate and that's what they're doing

1591
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,079
inside that root so so it's a it's a you

1592
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,720
know the philosophical question about

1593
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:37,760
which came first is is a fascinating one

1594
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:39,279
um but what happens in there is just

1595
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,680
absolutely unbelievable and the

1596
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,079
photographs folks that are in the book

1597
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:47,279
that show these individual bacteria and

1598
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:50,079
then show them as protoplasts or l forms

1599
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,880
and then show them as quads you know

1600
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,599
they're

1601
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,079
oh my gosh unbelievable and they only

1602
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,160
get better they only get better now i

1603
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,359
should say because it's not necessarily

1604
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:01,519
in the book and i don't know whether you

1605
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,239
want to get into it right now but from a

1606
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,038
cannabis growing perspective

1607
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:07,038
hey

1608
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,319
the question i wrote in the book at the

1609
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,640
time was

1610
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:12,719
are trichomes

1611
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:15,759
simply root hair

1612
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:16,959
that are formed on the leaf in the

1613
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,119
philosphere

1614
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,039
uh and a lot of research has been done

1615
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,559
in the two years since the book was

1616
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,440
written and went through the publishing

1617
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,440
process and it now appears that

1618
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,000
that there's sort of a similar thing

1619
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,119
happening with these bacteria in in

1620
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,960
trichomes the their cause

1621
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,119
in a sense part of the formation because

1622
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,280
they have ethylene but it but it but it

1623
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:43,838
appears that what's happening is there

1624
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:47,119
are bacteria inside these trichomes uh

1625
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:48,880
uh that that are being bombarded by

1626
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,720
super oxide

1627
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,720
and and then are going through the

1628
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:56,078
antioxidant situation that they went

1629
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:58,399
through in rhizophage uh and are

1630
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:02,480
you know nullifying the superoxidant by

1631
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:05,358
producing nitrogen inside the trichome

1632
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,199
but also producing all sorts of uh

1633
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:09,759
metabolites flavonoids you know

1634
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:11,759
cannabinoids etc so that there's a

1635
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,880
direct relationship between the

1636
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,039
rhizophage and what what what is being

1637
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,559
called endosymbiosis

1638
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:23,359
in the phyllosphere uh and inside the

1639
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,798
trichome so there's a there's definitely

1640
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:27,519
something going on here with these

1641
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,599
bacteria that we were not aware of uh

1642
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:32,000
that we could guess at

1643
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:34,798
that dr james white and some of his

1644
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,838
profes his students are now coming

1645
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:40,798
closer to getting the answers for and i

1646
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:42,798
i dare suspect that once cannabis is

1647
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:46,400
fully legalized so that we can study it

1648
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:48,719
in in a truly scientific method uh we're

1649
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,400
gonna find out an awful lot about how

1650
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:53,759
these bacteria uh influences uh the the

1651
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,000
trichomes and i'm gonna have to do a

1652
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,000
revised edition

1653
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,079
it's it really is amazing that you know

1654
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,480
we humans are so cocky thinking we know

1655
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,720
so much and and yet we we didn't even

1656
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:08,000
know that the rhizophysis cycle even

1657
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:11,038
existed until 2008 it's like there's so

1658
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,280
much more research we have to do about

1659
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,880
our planet and and then hopefully we

1660
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,039
won't kill it first

1661
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,519
you know and i say it's interesting i i

1662
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,039
think it's actually it was 2010 i sent a

1663
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:23,519
copy of the book

1664
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:27,440
to the woman in australia who made the

1665
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:29,838
discovery uh and and uh

1666
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,960
she since sort of moved on apparently

1667
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:35,199
because of funding etc etc but she was

1668
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,720
she was stunned and thrilled that

1669
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:41,598
somebody's really glammed onto this

1670
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:41,598
because it's so important do you

1671
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:48,000
yeah but i can't pronounce it so i'm

1672
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,960
going to open the book up and give it to

1673
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,798
you but it's i just cannot pronounce it

1674
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,920
it just makes me so angry uh

1675
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:57,759
i have to find it it's going to take me

1676
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,358
a minute here but go ahead and ask right

1677
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,960
now right now i'll

1678
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,558
just tell folks shannon

1679
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,639
here it is it's it's

1680
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,839
shannon

1681
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:09,279
uh punka fago

1682
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:11,038
lenheim wow that is that is a mouthful

1683
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,200
and you know it's it's it's hard to like

1684
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,680
walk that line right we want to give

1685
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,279
respect to the scientists but also if

1686
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,759
their names are in languages we're

1687
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,280
unfamiliar with we also don't want to do

1688
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,880
the disrespect of like butchering the

1689
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,400
name so i i'm sorry i put you in that

1690
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,838
position i get where you were coming no

1691
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,920
no no no no but but it gave me an

1692
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:30,719
opportunity it gives me an opportunity

1693
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:33,039
to once again point out this is not me

1694
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,318
folks i did not make these discoveries

1695
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,039
dr elaine

1696
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:40,719
you know and and dr james white they are

1697
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,720
the gurus not me uh all i did was parrot

1698
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,959
what they've what they've taught me so

1699
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:48,000
so uh yeah it's i'm glad you did that

1700
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,240
right on okay so um so that thank you

1701
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,239
for going through the the entire cycle

1702
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:54,879
so that as we go through these next few

1703
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:56,798
questions you know people already have

1704
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,880
the big picture and now we're now we're

1705
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:01,440
just going to kind of poke at it so

1706
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:04,400
okay you know one of my favorite parts

1707
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,639
of this cycle are exudates something

1708
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,200
that i have found fascinating ever since

1709
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:11,358
i started getting involved with learning

1710
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,960
about the the soil food web

1711
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:16,480
and you know generally cannabis

1712
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:19,679
cultivators understand that the exudates

1713
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,920
are selective nutrition that the plant

1714
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:23,118
uses to feed the microbes and other

1715
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,920
allies

1716
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:28,960
that come out of the roots and the in

1717
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,960
the hairs into the rhizosphere during

1718
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,440
the dark cycle during the light cycle

1719
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,760
the plant photosynthesizes and the

1720
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,599
rhizosphere feeds the plant but then

1721
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,000
during the dark cycle the plant like

1722
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:42,480
rewards the rhizosphere with exudates

1723
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,838
but few folks including me have a real

1724
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:48,000
understanding

1725
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:50,960
what these exudates specifically contain

1726
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,039
and how the selectiveness part of the

1727
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,159
plant functions you've already said that

1728
01:06:53,039 --> 01:07:00,559
that the the um that the the plant uses

1729
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:03,358
the exudates to attract particular

1730
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:06,480
members of the rhizosphere including

1731
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:08,400
bacteria and so will you kind of like

1732
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,119
break that out for us because this this

1733
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,358
is an incredible mechanism

1734
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,599
well uh you know the

1735
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,199
the plant uses that photosynthetic

1736
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,760
energy to make everything that's inside

1737
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,919
the plant uh and it's always a surprise

1738
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,559
to people to realize that they would

1739
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,480
waste so to speak by by

1740
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,559
exudating uh

1741
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,719
these things and and so they can they

1742
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,079
can adjust that extra date to attract

1743
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,480
what they need if they need more

1744
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,559
bacteria uh it's one thing if they need

1745
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,798
uh more protozoa

1746
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,839
it's another thing but in this

1747
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:43,519
particular instance there's one part of

1748
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:46,239
the extra date it's called this

1749
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:48,000
argentine that we talked about um

1750
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:49,199
that that

1751
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,480
really

1752
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:54,239
is so important to the cycle

1753
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,039
and if the plant wasn't producing it the

1754
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,639
cycle would occur so so

1755
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:03,680
uh it just points out how how important

1756
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:06,078
individual extra dates can be now we

1757
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:08,719
know that some of these extra dates

1758
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:11,519
attract uh uh

1759
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:14,078
fungi uh some of them attract yeast

1760
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,319
which is a fungi uh some of them act as

1761
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:19,359
cytophores you know they go out and they

1762
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:21,120
lock up various things so for example uh

1763
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,039
you know there are things that you don't

1764
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,599
want inside a plant and the plant has

1765
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:26,640
the capability of putting out an exudate

1766
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,400
that can

1767
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,798
you know can glom around those

1768
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,479
particular metals for example

1769
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:34,960
and prevent them from going inside the

1770
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,358
plant uh and bacteria have the

1771
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,960
capability of doing that as well uh and

1772
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,440
they're sort of trading around with this

1773
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,480
stuff so these exudates are incredibly

1774
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,919
important

1775
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,759
and they have everything in the world to

1776
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,920
do with not only the attraction of these

1777
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,838
microbes but the beginning of soil

1778
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,119
structure because once you attract these

1779
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:53,278
microbes

1780
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:56,559
they create the soil structure the

1781
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:58,719
bacteria with its slime uh the the fungi

1782
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,000
by tying tying together individual

1783
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,960
particles of soil uh you know so so

1784
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,439
it's just

1785
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,600
an unbelievably crucial thing and we

1786
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:10,399
actually date as we've talked before our

1787
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,960
sweat is exudate it attracts bacteria

1788
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,798
and fungi to our skin and if dial soap

1789
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,359
work the way that it's supposed to work

1790
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:20,319
we'd be dead in 24 hours because that

1791
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,679
stuff acts as a protective to us so it's

1792
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:25,600
it's key stuff

1793
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:28,158
um i want to focus in on uh one aspect

1794
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,400
of um nitrogen that you mentioned during

1795
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:34,479
the cycle you made this very interesting

1796
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:38,559
comparison between uh the traditional

1797
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:42,639
uh soil food web elaine ingham diffusion

1798
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:45,199
idea where our plant is growing and uh

1799
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,640
it absorbs nitrogen through the roots to

1800
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:51,759
feed itself and then the other example

1801
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,798
on this bacteria focused

1802
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,640
um

1803
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:59,359
rhizophages cycle where the cell is

1804
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:03,360
brought into the plant via the hairs it

1805
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:06,000
is then um stripped of its cell membrane

1806
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:08,000
no no no not not not via the hairs they

1807
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,079
come in through the meristem in the root

1808
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,920
tip ah thank you

1809
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,238
yeah so so then they find they find

1810
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:19,440
their way in they're stripped of their

1811
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:22,959
cell walls and then um uh they are they

1812
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:24,639
start to produce nitrates as a defense

1813
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,439
because they're all like my cell wall is

1814
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:31,280
gone i'm naked like quick let's produce

1815
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:34,158
this defending nitrate which is yes

1816
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:37,039
nitric nitric acid nitric acid

1817
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:39,679
which then turns into nitrate as a

1818
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:42,000
result of some of the the superoxide uh

1819
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,079
that the plant is spraying on them

1820
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,760
excellent thank you so so here here's

1821
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:46,880
the question the question is

1822
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,560
um

1823
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,239
these are both different ways that the

1824
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,800
plant gets nitrogen

1825
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:55,599
do you right do you think that one is

1826
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,560
preferable together then another or do

1827
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,840
we find that that both are important

1828
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,440
because they're going to be doing

1829
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,600
different things in the plant and

1830
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:05,759
perhaps it's just nature's redundancy to

1831
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,920
make sure things stay alive

1832
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,360
well i think both are important and

1833
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,000
obviously there's going to be a lot more

1834
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:14,000
research to determine but so far uh

1835
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,800
there have been studies that show about

1836
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,198
30 maybe 40 percent of the nitrogen in a

1837
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,920
plant can come from rhizo fish

1838
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:25,198
so so obviously that's a pretty

1839
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,239
significant uh number but but something

1840
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:31,359
else happens when that

1841
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:34,158
napdh sprays this superoxide

1842
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:35,198
onto the bacteria it has to make sure

1843
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:38,319
that it's

1844
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,599
not killing its own cell wall at the

1845
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:43,519
same time

1846
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:46,239
and so what happens is the plant cell

1847
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:49,920
becomes a little bit more resistant a

1848
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:53,279
little bit better able to handle stress

1849
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,359
uh as a result of that or that

1850
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:58,399
superoxide ros

1851
01:11:55,359 --> 01:12:01,759
being sprayed and it strengthens the

1852
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:04,879
plant and so the plant is is better able

1853
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,600
to handle various stresses as a result

1854
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,359
of having gone through this process

1855
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:12,159
we haven't even talked about the fact

1856
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:14,559
that that a lot of these bacteria these

1857
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:15,679
endophytic bacteria that enter the root

1858
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,360
and then move

1859
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:20,319
move into the plant

1860
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:23,359
produce these phytohormones

1861
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:25,119
like gibberellic acid and you know that

1862
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:28,238
that that cause

1863
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:30,158
ethylene that cause the plant uh to to

1864
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:32,000
have different reactions to different

1865
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:32,799
things and so they help the plant as

1866
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,640
well

1867
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,679
it's just incredible what these bacteria

1868
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,400
do

1869
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,719
this

1870
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:41,279
but it starts it starts with stimulating

1871
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:44,319
the cell of the plant to be more

1872
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,920
resistant and therefore healthier this

1873
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:47,840
is probably a good place to plug the

1874
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,840
book again because like by listening to

1875
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,679
this interview today you are not

1876
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,440
replacing the book i mean there are

1877
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,480
there are four chapters that i don't

1878
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:58,319
even pull questions from so um you know

1879
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:00,319
if you are if you are hearing our

1880
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,799
conversation today and you're getting

1881
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:04,880
fired up by some of the new ideas that

1882
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,880
you're having uh for goodness sakes uh

1883
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,079
go get the book because because you know

1884
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,600
as as as much as i try to capture

1885
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,840
everything in in this interview we're

1886
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,840
never gonna do in an hour and a half

1887
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,800
what's in this entire book so

1888
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,279
um

1889
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,880
all right so let's talk about let's see

1890
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:22,639
where was i

1891
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,079
oh yeah so so you know one of the

1892
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,440
insights that i found especially

1893
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:30,000
stirring was your statement that through

1894
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,238
using methods through you know

1895
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,479
cultivators using methods like natural

1896
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:36,158
farming and korean natural farming

1897
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,479
techniques specifically

1898
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:41,359
that that we can use valuable

1899
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:43,839
photosynthetic energy to biosynthesize

1900
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:45,359
exudates feeding the plant as much as i

1901
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,760
am helping the plant

1902
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,119
i'm sorry to attract bacteria and fungi

1903
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,719
to the root zone sorry i skipped a

1904
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:53,279
skipped a line in my reading so it's the

1905
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:55,840
point i'm trying to make is that

1906
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:59,198
you're suggesting that that the natural

1907
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:02,079
farming and k f that we do is really

1908
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:05,678
less about feeding the plant directly

1909
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:09,679
but it's really about helping the plant

1910
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:11,920
bait the hook to lure and attract the

1911
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,319
food its needs which brings us back to

1912
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,560
the idea again that i'm not actually the

1913
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:18,960
one who's feeding the plant i am the one

1914
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,600
that's feeding the soil and and my

1915
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,600
partner in this is the plant and and

1916
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,920
through knf and natural farming we're

1917
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,880
actually helping the plant bait the

1918
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,880
attractants that's huge

1919
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,039
yeah you're filling up the refrigerator

1920
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,119
uh you know and the plant doing that

1921
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:36,560
yeah yeah and and

1922
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:37,519
i think i try to make the point in the

1923
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,199
book that

1924
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,640
we can call it a k f we can call it

1925
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:44,158
regenerative farming we can call it

1926
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:46,719
whatever it's all soil food web uh and

1927
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:48,960
that's where it comes from uh it's it's

1928
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:51,520
it's making sure that the soil food web

1929
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:54,239
can operate to its fullest extent with

1930
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,400
the maximum amount of efficiency so that

1931
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:57,359
everybody's happy including

1932
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:59,279
you

1933
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,559
the individual that's taking care of the

1934
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,719
plants

1935
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,679
that's regenerative that is

1936
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:08,079
it it closes all the cycles and we are

1937
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:09,520
fully interacting with our crops and you

1938
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,039
know with the earth

1939
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:16,719
so these these root hairs these tubes at

1940
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:18,880
the end of the roots where we are um you

1941
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:23,039
know kind of uh uh

1942
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:25,440
flushing the the bacteria back out for

1943
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:28,238
for it to regenerate itself and then to

1944
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:30,000
come back so that we can shear it and

1945
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:32,559
and use it to

1946
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,238
produce nitrates again that that cycle

1947
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:39,440
is clearly important and and as a

1948
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:43,519
cultivator i want to know what i can do

1949
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:43,519
to encourage root hair growth

1950
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,360
well

1951
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,359
obviously you want to make sure that

1952
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,039
you're not disturbing any of the

1953
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,359
bacteria

1954
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:57,279
in your system um because that's what's

1955
01:15:53,359 --> 01:16:00,158
causing the roots hairs to grow um

1956
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:02,800
we want to be able to ultimately add in

1957
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:04,639
the right kinds of bacteria uh do we

1958
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,039
know for example with cannabis which

1959
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,000
ones they are

1960
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,560
you know

1961
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,520
we have some ideas but are you and i

1962
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:15,440
able to identify them no

1963
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,440
so we have to figure out a system to be

1964
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:19,599
able to do that and i think that's all

1965
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:21,279
coming i i see a time you know five

1966
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,520
years from now or ten years from now

1967
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:27,039
where we're going to be able to to

1968
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,719
uh take a soil sample uh

1969
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,279
and be able to analyze it with our cell

1970
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,399
phone and it'll tell us what's in it

1971
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,399
right now

1972
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:37,039
you can you can determine what kind of

1973
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:39,198
bacteria dna you've got by sending in

1974
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,359
samples and you know having an expensive

1975
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:44,000
system done uh but but we're going to

1976
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:45,599
end up with a you know like a 23andme

1977
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,119
system i think

1978
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,719
uh you know where we can find out

1979
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:50,238
exactly what's going on and that's so

1980
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:52,880
exciting that we're getting there now we

1981
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:54,319
know that there's a need for it so we'll

1982
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,000
we're certainly that there will be a

1983
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:58,000
development that gets it the databases

1984
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,319
are already there we've got databases of

1985
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
all the known bacteria

1986
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,319
and so we ought to be able to hook up

1987
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,880
what we've what we've got so it's common

1988
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,880
um uh but but there are certain

1989
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,679
certain things that we do know so for

1990
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,520
example we know that the bacterial mix

1991
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:14,640
in

1992
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,560
vermicompost is different than the

1993
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,719
bacterial mix in

1994
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:22,000
thermal compost

1995
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:25,239
and it it may turn out that using

1996
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,920
thermal compost is better than using

1997
01:17:25,238 --> 01:17:31,039
vermicompost because it has the right

1998
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,199
mix of bacteria in it to be able to feed

1999
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:34,640
the kind of plant that we want one of

2000
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:36,238
the things we haven't talked about is

2001
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,960
that these plants are are pretty

2002
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:42,079
specific why would a plant allow a

2003
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:44,158
bacteria to get into its root cells

2004
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:45,840
well it you know it does so if it's the

2005
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,279
right bacteria and it knows it's not

2006
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,760
going to harm it

2007
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,920
um and so

2008
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,520
so it's the plants are pretty selective

2009
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,359
about which bacteria they let in and

2010
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,400
which ones they won't and it turns out

2011
01:17:55,359 --> 01:18:00,479
that some bacteria go into a

2012
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,559
particular kind of grass i don't mean

2013
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:06,399
cannabis but a particular kind of grass

2014
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:08,640
and the grass thrives that same bacteria

2015
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:11,599
bacteria goes into a different kind of

2016
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,920
grass and that grass dies

2017
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,880
so it's very specific and this the

2018
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:20,239
evolution uh has determined which

2019
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,719
bacteria can go into which plants and we

2020
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:25,678
need to nail that down and we will it's

2021
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,439
all coming coming along just in the time

2022
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:29,679
that this book has been going through

2023
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:32,399
the publishing process as noted our

2024
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:34,319
whole concept of what goes on inside

2025
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:36,158
trichomes has changed

2026
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:37,519
dr james white and his students have

2027
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:41,279
discovered

2028
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:43,440
some of these bacteria inside cells

2029
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:46,158
inside

2030
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:47,599
nucleus

2031
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,359
what are they doing there they're on the

2032
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,159
nuclear pore

2033
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:51,759
uh

2034
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:53,759
are they providing something for the

2035
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,239
nuclear pore

2036
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:58,480
are they taking sugars from the what's

2037
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:59,678
going on there so there's lots of neat

2038
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:00,879
stuff that's going to be investigated

2039
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,239
we're going to get better and better and

2040
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,319
better at this stuff

2041
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:06,559
excellent so i want to take a side quest

2042
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:08,000
with you at this point um

2043
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,000
we've already recommended at the top of

2044
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,399
the show that people check out teaming

2045
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,119
with fungi uh one of your earlier books

2046
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:17,119
if they have not um it is you know it's

2047
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:19,039
a cannabis cultivation classic but you

2048
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:21,920
know it's actually enjoyed by gardeners

2049
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:23,439
of every kind of plant um so so i

2050
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,158
recommend people read that but i would

2051
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,960
like you to kind of like tie us to that

2052
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:28,879
book

2053
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,600
i would like you to make the linkage

2054
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,600
between the rhizophagia cycle and the

2055
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,440
mycelium network because mostly we've

2056
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,600
really been talking about like just the

2057
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:40,158
bacteria at this time

2058
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,079
but but i know that there are handoffs

2059
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:45,039
back and forth between the bacteria the

2060
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:47,039
mycelium network and and that's fleshed

2061
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:48,719
out also in team with fungi i believe

2062
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:51,519
but i'd like to i'd like to have you

2063
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,119
kind of tie that in at this point

2064
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:56,800
right well none of these microbes

2065
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:58,640
operate alone uh the soil food web is a

2066
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:01,520
web not a soil

2067
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:04,560
food microbe uh and so there everything

2068
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:07,520
is operating together and uh what we

2069
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,800
what we've discovered is that uh the

2070
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,320
first of all the

2071
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:14,480
the uh mycorrhizal fungi uh go into the

2072
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:16,960
plant they don't they don't invade the

2073
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:18,959
cell usually but they they they're in

2074
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,279
between the cell and then

2075
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,520
an invagination occurs but they're in

2076
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:26,719
between the cells and they're and

2077
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:29,679
they're providing nutrients uh uh to the

2078
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,279
plant in return from for those exudates

2079
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:34,000
in sort of a similar way that's

2080
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:35,840
happening to the bacterium although the

2081
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
bacteria isn't connected to the soil

2082
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,760
anymore it's providing nutrients that

2083
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,079
that may have come from the soil but

2084
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,199
then contained inside their their body

2085
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:48,719
but they operate in conjunction so for

2086
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:52,238
example along the mycorrhizal

2087
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:55,679
mycelium you will find uh plant growth

2088
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:58,799
promoting bacteria that sometimes act as

2089
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:00,800
in you know as rhizofascy bacteria

2090
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,679
but sometimes they just they just help

2091
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,920
out uh uh you know getting phosphorus

2092
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,920
for example and giving it to the uh to

2093
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:11,920
the fungi so the fungi can give it to

2094
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:14,800
the plant and they work together um

2095
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:17,039
by the same token there are some fungi

2096
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,440
that are that are not healthy for the

2097
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:22,319
plant and some of these bacteria can

2098
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:25,678
jump out of the root uh

2099
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:27,759
and and kill the the fungi and jump back

2100
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,679
into the root again so so there's this

2101
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,320
intricate relationship that goes on but

2102
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,840
the the plant growth promoting bacteria

2103
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:35,519
uh which are in some products that we

2104
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,920
can already buy i'm trying to you know

2105
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,480
unfortunately the damp i could uh

2106
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:43,039
mammoth you know it's you know those

2107
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:45,759
kinds of products they operate using the

2108
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:48,719
bacteria and the fungi i think

2109
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,480
uh and and and so they operate together

2110
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,399
and they work together

2111
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:54,718
so you know um

2112
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:57,039
we've talked before about how over

2113
01:21:54,719 --> 01:22:00,639
feeding a plant can make your plants

2114
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:03,359
roots and mycelium network lazy and and

2115
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:07,359
from thinking about this bacterial cycle

2116
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:10,639
this rhizophage cycle and all of the

2117
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:12,799
elegant work that is being done and how

2118
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:17,039
very specific

2119
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:20,880
that the nutrients are that the plant is

2120
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:24,800
farming and gathering for itself um i'm

2121
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:27,920
i'm convinced even more of of

2122
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:30,480
not over feeding our pot

2123
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:32,000
because if we're just making all of

2124
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,399
these kind of like

2125
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,279
loosey-goosey nutrients that we tend to

2126
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:39,359
add that are not as specific as the

2127
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:41,840
plant is specific

2128
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:44,559
that you know having all of all of this

2129
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:47,039
nutrition floating around is is is going

2130
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,280
to be there's a likelihood that i'm

2131
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:51,600
either going to um

2132
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:53,840
interrupt or screw up the rhizophage

2133
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,840
cycle

2134
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:59,759
or that i'm going to add enough food

2135
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:02,560
that suddenly the mycelium network is

2136
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,520
not reaching out to to

2137
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,480
the

2138
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:09,920
distant parts of the of the container or

2139
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:13,039
of the soil in order to get specific

2140
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:15,359
uh micronutrients or or that i can you

2141
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:17,439
know i might even injure the cycle it

2142
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:20,960
seems to me that we need to be

2143
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:22,399
exceptionally careful to only feed the

2144
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,600
plants

2145
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:28,638
as much food as they're going to need or

2146
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:32,000
or say amend as much as we need and and

2147
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:35,520
return our focus again and again to soil

2148
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,198
health versus dumping nutrition in

2149
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,360
right yeah there's no question that

2150
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:41,599
there are studies uh lots of them that

2151
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:44,799
show that the chemical nitrogen when

2152
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:47,679
it's applied as a fertilizer reduces you

2153
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,520
know the rhizophage symbiosis you know

2154
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,440
nitrogen fixation

2155
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,600
uh because the plant doesn't have to

2156
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:55,839
waste the exudates that's the reason i

2157
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,960
give anyway a little theological

2158
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,639
thinking but

2159
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,039
you know the plant doesn't have to waste

2160
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:02,400
its photosynthetic energy doing this

2161
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:05,279
other stuff or if it's getting it for

2162
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:07,439
free and it's very clear with cannabis

2163
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:09,198
studies that plants

2164
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:11,919
that are given

2165
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:15,119
artificial chemical nitrogen uh they

2166
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:19,039
don't they don't do the internal stuff

2167
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:21,279
the way the way a natural plant does

2168
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:23,679
so um

2169
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:26,479
and and again since we know since we

2170
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:29,279
since we know the bacteria uh influence

2171
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:31,039
the terpenoid flavonoids you know these

2172
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:32,639
secondary metabolites and stuff that are

2173
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:34,158
in the trichome

2174
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:37,279
you know if you're growing cannabis you

2175
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:39,759
want those trichomes you know why uh you

2176
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:42,079
want those trichomes to have the maximum

2177
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:45,440
amount of production in in them as

2178
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:47,279
possible uh and and uh you know there

2179
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:49,238
there is a model again we don't call it

2180
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:51,960
rhizophazzy i think we call it

2181
01:24:49,238 --> 01:24:54,799
endosymbiosis or symbiosis yeah

2182
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:57,760
endosymbiosis uh that that involves the

2183
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,520
trichome and so uh the the predictions

2184
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,719
that were in the book have actually come

2185
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,960
true

2186
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:06,639
so we're approaching 40 minutes so we're

2187
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:08,719
almost ready to uh um take a break but

2188
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:11,440
um you know i've already said there's no

2189
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:14,800
way that we're going to cover everything

2190
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:17,519
in the cycle today right but i know that

2191
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:21,119
you are particularly excited to talk

2192
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:22,320
about particular aspects of the cycle so

2193
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:25,840
i want to i want to kind of give you

2194
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:27,679
this open question um uh since in set

2195
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:31,039
three we're going to be talking about

2196
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,319
application of what we've learned in set

2197
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:34,560
one and two

2198
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:37,519
are there um um

2199
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,440
are there particular parts of the cycle

2200
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,679
that i have not focused on with my

2201
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:43,759
question for you that you're all like i

2202
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:45,600
really want to talk about this because

2203
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,679
now would be the time for you to say i

2204
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,239
really want to talk about this

2205
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:52,399
yeah i think i think the the endophytes

2206
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:55,599
that go into the plant not that are not

2207
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:58,079
rise involved in the rhizopy cycle

2208
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,920
you know are very very important uh and

2209
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,439
these these are also

2210
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,920
uh taken up from the soil food web uh

2211
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:08,000
conglomeration of bacteria that are are

2212
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,239
there in the rhizosphere and and they

2213
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,840
get into the plant uh

2214
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:16,559
through little cracks that form uh as

2215
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,639
branches of roots uh are forming there's

2216
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,159
always a little little cracks where

2217
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:23,440
where these guys can get in and they

2218
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:25,359
sneak in through wounds um

2219
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:27,119
you know and i suppose some of them i

2220
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,279
don't i don't know i don't think they

2221
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:31,279
come from the rhizoplasty cycle itself

2222
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:34,158
but they they get into the plant some of

2223
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,599
them get into the stomata uh and they

2224
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:38,079
and they and they

2225
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,960
can travel around throughout the plant

2226
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:43,600
and they impart all of these terrific

2227
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,760
terrific things to them so they can

2228
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,880
stimulate growth because they they can

2229
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,239
produce auxins they can produce

2230
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:53,520
cytocytokines uh they can produce

2231
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:56,000
ethylene and gibberellins and jasminic

2232
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:59,360
acids or you know silic all of the

2233
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,238
things that that that that cause plants

2234
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:04,799
to grow to form their flowers to drop

2235
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:08,158
their flowers for their fruits to ripen

2236
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:10,800
these are all bacterially produced uh

2237
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:14,079
and and uh you know we've learned an

2238
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:16,480
awful lot about them and and now we're

2239
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:19,519
beginning to figure out how to be able

2240
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:21,519
to supply either the phyto hormones that

2241
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,280
they produce for example with regard to

2242
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,040
gibberellins we can now produce

2243
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,960
gibberillic acid you can spray your

2244
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,880
plant with gibberellic acid uh you don't

2245
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,800
need the bacteria that create the

2246
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,400
gibberellins

2247
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,239
you know so we're learning all of these

2248
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:36,079
things and we're beginning to apply them

2249
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:39,279
to to different plants including

2250
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:42,719
cannabis and and and so these endophytes

2251
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:46,399
are are incredibly important in terms of

2252
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:48,319
enabling the plant to operate as a plant

2253
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:51,198
produce flowers drop flowers et cetera

2254
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:54,719
et cetera uh to to increase their their

2255
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:58,158
stress tolerances uh to out compete uh

2256
01:27:54,719 --> 01:28:00,800
plants that don't have them um

2257
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:02,479
to to change the the the temperatures

2258
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,719
which they're able to operate in i got a

2259
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:08,319
picture i think in the book of uh of an

2260
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:09,920
area in houston texas lawns and all the

2261
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:12,238
ones are covered with snow except for

2262
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,158
one of them because those grass plants

2263
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:17,279
must have an endophyte in it this change

2264
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:19,198
the freezing point of the water

2265
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:21,039
you know there's some really phenomenal

2266
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:22,960
stuff that goes on and and we're

2267
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:24,960
learning so much about this stuff and

2268
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,800
there's no question in my mind of all

2269
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,239
the books that i've ever written

2270
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,639
this is the one that's going to need a

2271
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:32,158
revised edition at some point so these

2272
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,159
endophytes that you're talking about it

2273
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:36,399
sounds like they since they're not part

2274
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:38,238
of the the rhizophagia cycle they're

2275
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:40,319
really just making a one-way trip they

2276
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:42,000
join the plant and then and then they

2277
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:44,000
stay in the plant right they're never

2278
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,760
they're never being re-released back

2279
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,279
into the rhizosphere

2280
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,039
well some of them are they go into the

2281
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:50,559
seed so you know they're in the flower

2282
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:52,960
and the next thing though they go back

2283
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:55,039
into the seed and so uh

2284
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,679
yeah it's pretty amazing

2285
01:28:55,039 --> 01:29:00,238
the the idea that the bacteria are such

2286
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,560
opportunists and they they they get into

2287
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:04,959
the plant where doors are left open and

2288
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,719
cracks in the root and you know wounds

2289
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,239
and all these different places you know

2290
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,840
it's interesting because on one hand

2291
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,919
you're talking about these like

2292
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,079
beneficial endophytes which we want in

2293
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:17,760
the plant but this is also the same

2294
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:19,840
place that um like pathogenic bacteria

2295
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:24,079
would get into the plant as well

2296
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,880
and um you know because i want to avoid

2297
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:27,760
the

2298
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:29,760
the negative bacterias it's got me

2299
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,000
thinking in whole new ways about for

2300
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,880
example staking plants

2301
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,198
near

2302
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,600
the rhizosphere right because you know

2303
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:39,519
there are certainly cages on the outside

2304
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,600
area which which are you know best for

2305
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,280
supporting a plant but a lot of people

2306
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:48,239
are you'll put the steak in

2307
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:50,880
alongside the plant and then um

2308
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:53,759
in in some way bind the plant to the

2309
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:57,600
steak but that means that the steak is

2310
01:29:53,760 --> 01:30:00,000
going into the root zone and probably

2311
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,159
ripping all sorts of root and root hairs

2312
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,399
along the way and actually causing

2313
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:06,799
trauma to the root zone that is pretty

2314
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:10,559
much in inviting

2315
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:12,719
uh bacteria of of all forms and it seems

2316
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,320
to me like we are rolling the dice when

2317
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:16,560
we do that

2318
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,000
well it could be and and you know some

2319
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,920
of those steaks like you know those

2320
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,359
tomato steaks they got a little green

2321
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,359
stuff on it is that there to kill

2322
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:25,519
bacteria you know and fungus and keep

2323
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:27,119
the you know it's so so yeah i mean i

2324
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,199
think you got to be very very careful

2325
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:30,880
and and experiment i think i think you

2326
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:35,119
got to experiment it may very well be

2327
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:37,920
that you you if you dip that that steak

2328
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,840
uh into compost uh let it sit there for

2329
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,840
a week or so it absorbs the right kind

2330
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,920
of bacteria that are in the compost that

2331
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:46,159
might help your plant so we we've got a

2332
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,760
lot of research to do here right that's

2333
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:50,000
a great idea i think i might just do

2334
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:53,039
that just as a as a preventative at this

2335
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,880
point um right yeah so all right cool so

2336
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,238
let's go ahead and take our second short

2337

choose not only that if you pick the

2343

new businesses in cannabis psilocybin

2442
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:55,519
and other psychedelics and it's a very

2443
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:57,599
strange time for us in the same moment

2444
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,520
that psilocybin mushrooms are illegal at

2445
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,520
the federal level they are becoming

2446
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:02,560
increasingly legal in states across the

country

2448
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,639
these businesses leading the way into

2449
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:08,960
the future of plant medicines require

2450
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:10,880
specialized legal representation by

2451
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:13,439
attorneys who have depth not only in

2452
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,279
litigation mergers and acquisitions but

2453
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:16,879
also in psychedelic and other plant

2454
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:18,719

2455
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,800

empowering cannabis businesses since

2457
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,520

welcome back you are listening to

2498
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,960
shaping fire i'm your host shango los

2499
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:54,638
and my guest today is jeff lowenfels so

2500
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,840
during the first set we learned a lot

2501
01:36:54,639 --> 01:37:00,560
about bacteria generally then during the

2502
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,960
second set we got really specific about

2503
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,920
the rhizophages cycle

2504
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,480
and

2505
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:09,039
how the bacteria is interacting with the

2506
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:10,319
root zone of the plant but also at the

2507
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:14,319
top of the plant too which is

2508
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:17,599
astonishing and this third set um we are

2509
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:19,279
going to focus more on how to use this

2510
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,719
understanding that we're starting to get

2511
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:21,599
about bacteria

2512
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:24,239
to

2513
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:26,480
make our gardens more successful higher

2514
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:29,919
yielding and resilient

2515
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:31,678
so um so i want to start jeff with um

2516
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,760
with commercial fertilizers now you

2517
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,118
touched on it briefly earlier i don't

2518
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,760
know if you have more to say about it

2519
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:41,039
but but i know that um you know you have

2520
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:44,480
mentioned to me time and time again that

2521
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:46,880
that commercial fertilizers that are are

2522
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:51,118
not just straight up soil amendments

2523
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:53,520
fertilizers that are are you know um

2524
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:54,799
super nutritive because of how they were

2525
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,840
made

2526
01:37:54,800 --> 01:38:00,560
actually inhibit the rhizophage cycle

2527
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,960
and you know generally make our plants

2528
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:04,320
like kind of druggy salt dependent but

2529
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:07,520
i'd like to hear what you have to say

2530
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:10,000
about how commercial fertilizers inhibit

2531
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,080
the rhizophage cycle and and what we

2532
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
should be avoiding

2533
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:15,519
sure well uh

2534
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,158
what happens when you put a commercial

2535
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:19,679
fertilizer into the rhizosphere is you

2536
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:22,000
change the composition of that

2537
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:24,480
rhizosphere because there's salts some

2538
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,600
of the some of the microbes bacteria are

2539
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:28,399
killed

2540
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:30,320
the water drains out of them to dilute

2541
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:32,000
the salt and the salt goes into them and

2542
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:35,279
osmosis and the and they and so they

2543
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:38,560
blow up uh in in other instances there

2544
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:41,519
are microbes that literally will go

2545
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:44,159
crazy for the chemical that your

2546
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,520
synthetic that you've put down and will

2547
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:50,079
change the composition or the ratio of

2548
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:52,320
the bacterium and other microbes in the

2549
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:54,319
area and that's not good either you

2550
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:56,399
remember we want to we want to let the

2551
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:58,719
plant be in control the plant should be

2552
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:00,479
able to choose what it wants and get as

2553
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:02,800
much of what it wants

2554
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:05,919
when it wants it and when you when you

2555
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:08,079
change the ratio when you kill off some

2556
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:12,399
of the things that are needed the plant

2557
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:14,238
has to react in a way that either uh

2558
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:17,519
causes them to have to reproduce

2559
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:20,799
reproduce the extra date in order to re

2560
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:24,639
regenerate the the microbe that it needs

2561
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:26,400
uh or it just just gives up or it just

2562
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,679
simply says i can coast along on what

2563
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:30,479
i'm getting here i don't need to do

2564
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:32,560
these other things and and it loses the

2565
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:35,118
benefits of having an endophyte causing

2566
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,800
stimulation uh you know causing the

2567
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:38,479
plant to be able to handle stress better

2568
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,960
and all those kinds of things and so you

2569
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:43,198
end up with a weaker plant and then you

2570
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:45,600
throw in the fact that you've started

2571
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:48,559
the path of destroying

2572
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:51,920
the structure of the soil we've only got

2573
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:54,800
60 years left of soil using the current

2574
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:57,520
techniques uh you know every every time

2575
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:00,320
we we harvest and rototill

2576
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:02,880
we destroy the soil structure and we are

2577
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:04,399
we are headed to big trouble and it's

2578
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,159
it's going to be the next generation

2579
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:08,399
that's going to suffer that trouble

2580
01:40:06,158 --> 01:40:12,000
that's why all of these bacterial

2581
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:16,079
situations rhizophagy endophytes are i

2582
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:20,000
think the holy grail for the com the the

2583
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:21,840
conversion of chemical agriculture to uh

2584
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,039
you know the organic system that you and

2585
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:25,279
i know and love

2586
01:40:23,039 --> 01:40:28,399
so you know we talk primarily about

2587
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:30,719
natural farming and regenerative um

2588
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:32,238
gardening techniques on this show but

2589
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:34,800
you know there's no doubt that we are

2590
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:37,039
going to attract some people who use

2591
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:39,199
salt fertilizers for this episode

2592
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:41,279
because the information is so rare to

2593
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:44,719
get and so i'm going to ask you an

2594
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:47,279
impossible question um and and and say

2595
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:50,000
just like just give me a taste for those

2596
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:53,118
people right so for the people who are

2597
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:56,960
here to learn about bacteria but they

2598
01:40:53,118 --> 01:40:58,960
use you know um salt fertilizers or ab

2599
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,880
style fertilizers or or maybe they've

2600
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:03,439
got fields and they're using you know

2601
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,679
large branded commercial fertilizers you

2602
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:07,678
know what is the alternative what what

2603
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:09,760
are we trying to suggest that they use

2604
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:11,920
instead of that stuff

2605
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,679
right well of course i've got a lot of

2606
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,920
stuff at the end of the book that you

2607
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,639
know individual bacterium's names i

2608
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:20,960
can't pronounce uh so so people need to

2609
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:24,480
take a look at that but but uh you know

2610
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:27,039
there are some very distinct uh kinds of

2611
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:30,559
things that we can put on our plants and

2612
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:34,399
in our soil uh uh you know one of them

2613
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:37,360
with regard to uh cannabis is is used

2614
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:38,960
for wheat and other things as azo

2615
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:41,439
spirulium

2616
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,319
and and we can spray that on our plants

2617
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:45,519
and we can

2618
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:49,759
water it down into our soil uh and and

2619
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:51,760
it it it ends up helping the plant uh so

2620
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:54,560
you don't need to use a chemical you've

2621
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:57,679
got a a living a living bacterium

2622
01:41:54,560 --> 01:42:00,000
supplying the food that the plant needs

2623
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,880
a lot of cannabis growers are beginning

2624
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,880
to

2625
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:07,118
to do experiments with asos beryllium um

2626
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:08,719
and so you have to adjust yourself so

2627
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:09,839
for example you wouldn't want to use

2628
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:11,679
neem oil

2629
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,960
uh because wouldn't the neem oil kill

2630
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:16,239
off whatever you're putting on your

2631
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:19,359
philosophy and uh does neem oil maybe

2632
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:20,959
doesn't do such great things for uh

2633
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:22,799
you know the the bacterium in the

2634
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:25,760
rhizosphere now there's a time when you

2635
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,560
need it perhaps uh but not all the time

2636
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,960
so

2637
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,480
yeah i think you know we just have to we

2638
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,158
we're going to have to just do lots of

2639
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:34,638
lots of lots of experiments but if

2640
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:35,679
you're growing individual crops

2641
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:37,840
uh

2642
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:39,039
you know there are now and again i list

2643
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:42,400
some of them in the book there are

2644
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:44,719
studies on individual endophytes or

2645
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:48,638
groups of endophytes that help uh

2646
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:51,520
specific crops you know trees uh uh

2647
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:53,440
vegetables tomatoes etc etc

2648
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:56,400
and and we're beginning to get a feel

2649
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:58,638
for the kinds of bacterium we can or

2650
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:00,960
bacteria we can add to the soil and to

2651
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:03,199
these plants and make things work and

2652
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,719
and it makes me think about compost teas

2653
01:43:03,198 --> 01:43:06,479
i mean for years and years and years

2654
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:08,800
i've been using compost tea i know they

2655
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:10,559
work i know compost teas work i've i've

2656
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,960
done before and afters i've done bad

2657
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:15,360
soil good soil but a lot of time people

2658
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,118
don't get results with compost teas and

2659
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:19,279
that may be because they've already got

2660
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:21,439
all the components that the compost tea

2661
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:23,198
supplies to a system that doesn't have

2662
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:25,279
all the components and so therefore they

2663
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:26,559
don't see any differences

2664
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:29,279
it's all tied together and there's going

2665
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,199
to be tremendous amounts of research

2666
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,118
whoa to be able to go back to grad

2667
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:34,399
school and study some of these questions

2668
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:35,839
yeah

2669
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:38,638
we talk about that often on the show

2670
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,480
about what time what a great time it is

2671
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:42,560
to be somebody in their late teens or

2672
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:44,799
early 20s and starting off with these

2673
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:48,000
interests because between between the

2674
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,920
creeping normalization and the access to

2675
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,679
lab equipment that we cannabis folks

2676
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,920
have now i mean we're about to enter the

2677
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:55,118
golden age of research

2678
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,520
um

2679
01:43:55,118 --> 01:44:00,079
so uh so there's also different

2680
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,000
qualities of compost tea right where

2681
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:03,760
right you know a lot a lot of people you

2682
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,118
know they're they they're relying on

2683
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,440
their compost tea but then they put it

2684
01:44:05,118 --> 01:44:10,079
on their microscope and you know it's

2685
01:44:07,439 --> 01:44:12,000
it's nutrition but no life

2686
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:14,719
and so you know just because something

2687
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:19,198
is called compost tea there is a

2688
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:19,198
difference between you know a

2689
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,119
i don't know inert compost tea a dead

2690
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:26,639
compost tea that's just full of

2691
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:29,519
nutrition versus a compost tea that is

2692
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:32,960
chock full of all these living bits just

2693
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:35,199
like you can have uh uh you know dead

2694
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,000
soil which we generally call dirt right

2695
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:40,638
there's dirt that's not bioactive and

2696
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,880
then after you spend some time and and

2697
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:45,679
you start adding you know bacterias and

2698
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:47,760
mycelium and compost teas and and and

2699
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:50,399
fortified it properly then you have

2700
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,000
living soils so so composting are in

2701
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:55,359
that same way so i'm going to follow up

2702
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,439
with um you know are there particular

2703
01:44:55,359 --> 01:45:00,839
things that we can compost and make

2704
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:05,198
compost tea out of that will be

2705
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:07,920
uh supportive of endophytic bacteria

2706
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:10,399
well you know compost is full of

2707
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:13,199
into fights um and and so is

2708
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:14,799
vermicompost i think you know the book

2709
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:16,879
talks a little teeny bit about the

2710
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:19,679
differences they're different

2711
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,520
sets in in one versus the other

2712
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:23,199
and what you put into your compost is

2713
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,360
gonna going to end up with different

2714
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:28,079
stuff coming out via compost as as you

2715
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:31,439
can imagine um

2716
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:34,079
so i i dream about what if i was able to

2717
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:36,479
to make a compost out of my cannabis

2718
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:38,719
plant wastes

2719
01:45:36,479 --> 01:45:41,198
and then use that on my cannabis doesn't

2720
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:43,760
that supply the right kinds of bacteria

2721
01:45:41,198 --> 01:45:45,759
i i suspect it does i don't i don't know

2722
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,440
for sure but sure makes sense to me

2723
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:50,320
doesn't it

2724
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:53,678
um you know so there there are things

2725
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:55,759
that we can be looking at uh in terms of

2726
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,520
specificity and again

2727
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,360
the research that's coming and the

2728
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,800
instrumentation that we're going to

2729
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:02,399
require in order to be able to tell

2730
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,039
whether we're getting there

2731
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:06,719
it's kind of important oh you mean like

2732
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:08,399
the technology so that we can measure

2733
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:10,239
this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2734
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:11,519
exactly exactly i mean we can measure it

2735
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:12,879
now it's cost

2736
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,639
millions and millions of dollars you

2737
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:18,239
know it just costs a lot of money to

2738
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:20,400
send away a sample to get its dna

2739
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:22,079
it's getting cheaper and cheaper so so

2740
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:24,479
now we're all in love with endophytic

2741
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:26,880
bacteria and we want to attract as much

2742
01:46:24,479 --> 01:46:27,919
of it as we can to our root zone

2743
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,319
um

2744
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:32,639
by using natural farming techniques uh

2745
01:46:30,319 --> 01:46:34,399
is it possible to

2746
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:37,039
um apply

2747
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:41,359
endophytic bacteria like can we can we

2748
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:42,880
can we amend with uh endophytic bacteria

2749
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:45,198
yes uh

2750
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:48,000
let me give you the easiest example uh

2751
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:49,839
rhizobium uh you know the the the

2752
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,118
nitrogen fixing bacteria that form

2753
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:55,360
nodules um uh you know that's that

2754
01:46:53,118 --> 01:46:57,599
that's we apply that

2755
01:46:55,359 --> 01:47:00,158
uh those bacteria as a result of

2756
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,719
ethylene i might add end up inside a

2757
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:05,198
little nodule in the plant uh that those

2758
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:07,359
are endophytic bacteria so so yes we're

2759
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:09,599
going to be able to supply them like

2760
01:47:07,359 --> 01:47:12,079
like that

2761
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:14,239
there are there is even a series of

2762
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:16,960
discussions about being able to uh

2763
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:20,238
supply endophytic bacteria that can live

2764
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:23,039
in the in the plant jump off the plant

2765
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:24,559
and kill the weeds that are around the

2766
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:26,479
plant and then jump back into the

2767
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,480
planting camp whoa

2768
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:31,279
yeah so there's all of these things are

2769
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:34,000
coming um and we just have to be able to

2770
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:35,679
identify better dr james white could

2771
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,679
tell you as as can a handful of

2772
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:39,118
scientists around the world that if you

2773
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,239
apply xy

2774
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:42,079
uh

2775
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:45,279
bacteria to

2776
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:48,000
wheat you end up with better wheat or

2777
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:49,439
zd bacteria to bananas you end up with

2778
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,359
better bananas

2779
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:54,238
the research simply

2780
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:56,479
hasn't been done on the cannabis because

2781
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:59,039
of the laws that we face in the united

2782
01:47:56,479 --> 01:48:01,599
states about to change if my dear

2783
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:03,519
classmate chuck schumer has his way

2784
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:05,920
we're going to have good research on

2785
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,880
cannabis finally and this is one of the

2786
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,319
biggest things they ought to be

2787
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,679
researching

2788
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:12,238
so how does

2789
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:14,800
the nitrogen fixing that we in cannabis

2790
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:16,799
cultivation uh do

2791
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,560
um how you know most people call it

2792
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:21,119
cover crops even though that that word

2793
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:23,600
doesn't perfectly fit right but but you

2794
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:25,679
know we we we grow something on the top

2795
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,440
and then we chop it we let it drop maybe

2796
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:30,480
we cover it with some compost or some

2797
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:33,919
more soil so that um you know the plant

2798
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:35,359
itself is pulling nitrogen from the air

2799
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,560
and then putting it down to the roots

2800
01:48:35,359 --> 01:48:37,679
and then we kill the plant and then that

2801
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:42,080
makes the

2802
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:44,158
the um nitrogen available to um other

2803
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:44,960
participants in the

2804
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:46,799
uh

2805
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:49,039
in the container or in the soil if

2806
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:52,880
you're on a field um

2807
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:56,000
how does this sort of nitrogen fixing um

2808
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:58,000
play a role in this bacteria story

2809
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,520
well we don't we don't call it nitrogen

2810
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,118
fixing but that's what's going on with

2811
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,199
these razor fascia bacteria they're

2812
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:05,118
fixing nitrogen and giving it to the

2813
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:08,158
plant uh same thing with the

2814
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:11,118
endosymbiosis in the in the uh

2815
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:13,839
in the philosophy i mean those bacteria

2816
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:17,279
inside those trichomes are fixing

2817
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,560
nitrogen and giving it to the plant um

2818
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:20,719
wow

2819
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:22,960
so so you you know what we what we

2820
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:25,439
really want to do is be able to

2821
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:28,239
introduce these kinds of

2822
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:30,799
nitrogen fixing bacteria that don't

2823
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:33,359
necessarily form nodules into various

2824
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:35,920
kinds of plants and where you know bayer

2825
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:37,759
and all those big guys uh you know who

2826
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:39,118
who we accuse of all sorts of terrible

2827
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,199
things because they do some terrible

2828
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:43,759
things they're studying all this stuff

2829
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:45,198
like crazy now and i i would predict at

2830
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:47,119
some point in time

2831
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:49,759
that's what they'll be selling uh you

2832
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:52,639
know they'll be selling bacteria that

2833
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:54,639
can go into a plant or fungi that can go

2834
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,639
into a plant they already sell you know

2835
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,760
mycorrhizal fungi they can go into the

2836
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:01,199
plant and fix nitrogen wow

2837
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,719
wouldn't that be incredible if you if

2838
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:04,479
you could grow a tomato plant or a

2839
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:05,840
cannabis plant without adding any

2840
01:50:04,479 --> 01:50:08,158
nitrogen because you've got enough

2841
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,520
fixation going on right there

2842
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:11,359
for those who haven't picked it up out

2843
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:13,280
of context yet would you define

2844
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:15,920
philosophy here please

2845
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:18,399
philosopher is the is the uh rhizosphere

2846
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,399
around the leaf it's that it's that area

2847
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:22,799
along the relief surface where there's

2848
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,319
microbes and dust and

2849
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,239
you know little little things that are

2850
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:28,559
that are there so that's we call it the

2851
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:30,879
rhizosphere around the root uh and it's

2852
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:34,159
the philosopher around around leaves and

2853
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:37,359
that's primarily where the bacteria that

2854
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:39,519
finds its way into our seeds to start

2855
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:41,118
the next generation that's where it

2856
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:44,320
comes from it's the phyllosphere so it

2857
01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:47,039
so this the seed is being formed in the

2858
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:49,840
flower and the bacteria that is in the

2859
01:50:47,039 --> 01:50:50,960
flower which is um

2860
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,480
you know

2861
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,079
i'm sure there's some variety but it's

2862
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:56,718
also the same bacterias that are in the

2863
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:59,118
root zone it's jumping into that seed if

2864
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:01,679
you will so that it is present when the

2865
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:03,759
seed is germinated down the line

2866
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:05,279
yeah both both are both go into the sea

2867
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,280
so it's you know it's cable you're

2868
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:08,960
capable of taking you know the soil

2869
01:51:07,279 --> 01:51:10,399
bacteria that become into fights and go

2870
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,840
in they can move through the flow you

2871
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:14,079
know they they can move around inside

2872
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:16,079
the plant um and they do move around

2873
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:18,719
inside the plant but but yeah so you get

2874
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:21,118
a l it's called vertical and horizontal

2875
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:22,319
transfer

2876
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:24,639
yeah so

2877
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:27,039
is that gonna get some from the air is

2878
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:29,199
there anything that we can do to attract

2879
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:31,760
more beneficial bacteria to the

2880
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:34,319
rhizosphere right like if like other

2881
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:35,840
than having a healthy plant you know

2882
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:37,359
like like like some people right they

2883
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,840
just they want to they want to dump

2884
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:41,920
molasses on everything right um is it

2885
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,599
right is it you know and then you know i

2886
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,920
am probably more in a category that i

2887
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:48,319
use too much

2888
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:50,480
korean natural farming preps like you

2889
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:52,799
know if they say one one to a thousand

2890
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:54,399
i'm loving it at one at 250 right and i

2891
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:57,199
know i shouldn't be doing that but it's

2892
01:51:54,399 --> 01:51:58,158
really hard not to um so so in that kind

2893
01:51:57,198 --> 01:52:00,399
of

2894
01:51:58,158 --> 01:52:02,638
dumb mindset i asked this question and

2895
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:05,118
perhaps there's a smart answer

2896
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:08,960
is is there anything that we can

2897
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:12,238
top amend um along the

2898
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:14,719
um stem of the plant that will find its

2899
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:18,158
way down to the root zone that will you

2900
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:20,560
know bring in more beneficial bacteria

2901
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:23,519
yeah again an area where some great

2902
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:25,360
research has to be done but using soil

2903
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,040
from old growth

2904
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:30,238
cannabis

2905
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:32,560
and putting that down uh as a as a way

2906
01:52:30,238 --> 01:52:34,638
of transferring the bacterium that or

2907
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,520
bacteria that were produced on that

2908
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:39,520
previous plant is probably the way to go

2909
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,840
right on so a great great reason to you

2910
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:43,920
know reuse last year's pots keep your

2911
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:45,840
soil right you know the whole no-till

2912
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:47,920
vibe that that you know right we're

2913
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:50,079
strong proponents of here

2914
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,599
yeah exactly but it goes one step even

2915
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:53,118
further i mean you could you could

2916
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:56,159
actually take some of that soil from a

2917
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:58,399
pot and put it into a new pot

2918
01:52:56,158 --> 01:53:00,399
as opposed to planting the seed in the

2919
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:02,079
old pot right you can you can you can

2920
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:05,198
use it as a top dress like you would

2921
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:07,599
compost yeah yeah yeah inoculate yeah

2922
01:53:05,198 --> 01:53:09,519
yeah it's good too um all right so let's

2923
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:11,679
let's let's flip that risk all right so

2924
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:13,920
we've been talking about things to do to

2925
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:16,079
pres uh to preserve

2926
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,359
the or excuse me to attract more

2927
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:18,158
bacteria

2928
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:21,039
um

2929
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:23,279
what are the actions that we can take

2930
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:24,960
that will kill all the bacteria in the

2931
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:26,719
pot i'm assuming like at the top of the

2932
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:29,359
list is heat and water but i don't know

2933
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:31,599
so so what are those variables

2934
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:34,479
yeah oh definitely heat um

2935
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:37,599
uh but even even with regard to heat a

2936
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:40,319
lot of these things will will form uh uh

2937
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:42,000
you know into into cardinal word

2938
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:43,840
endospores endospores yeah the

2939
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
endospores they form endospores they're

2940
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:48,639
able to withstand the heat uh which is

2941
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:51,679
how a lot of the bacterium that we like

2942
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:53,920
go through the composting process uh and

2943
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,079
still survive um

2944
01:53:53,920 --> 01:54:00,000
so so you know you've got you've got

2945
01:53:56,079 --> 01:54:00,000
that situation going on uh

2946
01:54:00,319 --> 01:54:03,279
i don't know the answer all right fair

2947
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,880
enough so i'm gonna ask you another

2948
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:06,238
question that you may not have answered

2949
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,440
it's a follow-up to the heat one though

2950
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:12,879
right so so uh you know those of us who

2951
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:14,879
are in containers are our soil is at

2952
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,719
much more risk than people who are in

2953
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:19,279
the ground right because people who are

2954
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,800
in the actual ground the roots can go

2955
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:22,800
deep where it's cooler they get the

2956
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:24,480
geothermal advantages it's wonderful

2957
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,599
both during the summer and in the fall

2958
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:27,118
when it starts to cool down and the

2959
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:29,599
roots are kept warmer right so that's

2960
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:32,000
awesome but but lots of us are in

2961
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:32,960
containers and on a day

2962
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,359
um

2963
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:38,079
where it's like you know 95 to 105

2964
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:41,519
the

2965
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:44,079
the the plant containers cook just

2966
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:46,560
sitting in the sun and if we're in a

2967
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:48,719
greenhouse that's not supported with air

2968
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:52,800
conditioning it might even be even

2969
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:54,880
hotter do you have an idea how much heat

2970
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:57,520
it's going to take

2971
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:59,039
before the bacteria start to cyst up

2972
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:01,280
because like okay they might be able to

2973
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:03,920
survive the heat but we don't want them

2974
01:55:01,279 --> 01:55:05,840
to have to go through all of that hassle

2975
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:07,840
of of cysting up and then and then

2976
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:09,199
realizing it's safe again and then and

2977
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:11,760
then and you know like we're slowing

2978
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:14,399
down our plant growth so

2979
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:17,360
i'm curious on these days that that it's

2980
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:19,598
you know 95 to 105 and our and our

2981
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:22,319
containers are getting really hot am i

2982
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:24,079
wiping out my bacteria

2983
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:26,079
uh you know it's interesting question

2984
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:27,920
again i don't know the real answer it's

2985
01:55:26,079 --> 01:55:29,760
you know intuitively it seems to me that

2986
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,599
some of them are multiplying some of

2987
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,560
them are going into a dormant situation

2988
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:35,360
as a result of the heat um

2989
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,560
and

2990
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:39,118
uh

2991
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:41,039
i i wonder whether the plant adjusts

2992
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:42,880
extra dates etcetera etcetera in order

2993
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:45,519
to be able to try to to fix that

2994
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:48,319
situation i don't know um

2995
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:50,880
obviously the the thing that controls

2996
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:53,359
how well a plant grows temperature wise

2997
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:55,039
is the enzymatic activity inside the

2998
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:59,039
plant and it's around

2999
01:55:55,039 --> 01:56:00,719
i think it's 76 to 79 degrees is ideal

3000
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:03,279
uh and it has more to do with the

3001
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:04,639
enzymes uh produced and some of those

3002
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:07,359
enzymes are obviously produced by

3003
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:09,679
bacteria so so it's a good question

3004
01:56:07,359 --> 01:56:12,079
again i hate to give the answer more

3005
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:12,800
research yeah well that's fairly and and

3006
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:13,679
and

3007
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,639
also

3008
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:15,920
you

3009
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,599
we've been we've all been reading you

3010
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,760
for so long and you've done so much

3011
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:21,279
research both on bacteria generally and

3012
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:23,360
also our favorite plant the cannabis

3013
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:25,198
plant that if somebody's gonna make an

3014
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:26,799
educated guess i'm comfortable with it

3015
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:29,039
being you right

3016
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:31,279
because you know i i would i would be a

3017
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:33,439
lot more suspicious of like generalized

3018
01:56:31,279 --> 01:56:35,198
bro science that someone learned by you

3019
01:56:33,439 --> 01:56:37,198
know from somebody who taught them to

3020
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:39,678
grow because i certainly know i got a

3021
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:40,879
bunch of bad information from my mentor

3022
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:43,039
even though i got a lot of great

3023
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,279
information too you know we're kind of

3024
01:56:43,039 --> 01:56:46,719
at the point in in cannabis culture

3025
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:49,920
where we're trying to figure out which

3026
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:52,880
is which right so so absolutely here's a

3027
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,480
similar question slightly twisted um so

3028
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:56,560
so far we've talked about all these

3029
01:56:54,479 --> 01:56:59,198
things that we can do to encourage

3030
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:01,920
bacteria generally but we know that

3031
01:56:59,198 --> 01:57:04,319
there are beneficial bacterias and then

3032
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:07,920
pathogenic bacterias are there things

3033
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:11,840
that we can do to keep bad bacteria from

3034
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,840
invading to limit it somehow

3035
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:18,400
you know there must be uh which is why

3036
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:19,360
people keep sterile uh you know they say

3037
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:21,279
sterile

3038
01:57:19,359 --> 01:57:23,279
their greenhouse situation they don't

3039
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:27,039
let any you know any insects in the

3040
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:29,279
convector bad bacteria etc uh uh on the

3041
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:31,599
plants and you're very careful and you

3042
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:32,639
know you don't smoke inside the the you

3043
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:34,960
know touch

3044
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:36,079
uh tobacco that kind of stuff you know

3045
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,000
it's

3046
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:40,238
so you can clearly spread these bacteria

3047
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,238
around no question about it and and you

3048
01:57:40,238 --> 01:57:44,000
probably have to be very very careful

3049
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:45,919
not you don't probably you have to be

3050
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,000
careful not to bring in a bad a bad

3051
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:50,239
bacterium you know that might cause some

3052
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:53,039
kind of a you know a mildew etc etc

3053
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:54,879
although those are usually fungus um

3054
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:56,560
so it is possible to you know cause some

3055
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:58,400
real serious problems fortunately i

3056
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,639
don't think it happens that often and

3057
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:02,399
clamping off

3058
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:05,440
it sounds like we doubt so this is yet

3059
01:58:02,399 --> 01:58:06,559
another reason to keep a clean

3060
01:58:05,439 --> 01:58:08,000
um

3061
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:10,239
a clean growing environment right

3062
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,760
cleaning your tools cleaning the floor

3063
01:58:10,238 --> 01:58:13,598
you know not taking things off the floor

3064
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:16,000
putting it in your pot things like that

3065
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:17,599
as well because we don't want to upset

3066
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,158
the balance between the beneficial

3067
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:22,319
bacteria and the pathogenic bacteria

3068
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:23,839
right and even even things like i think

3069
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:24,719
you know i talk a little bit about about

3070
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,079
it in the book it's sort of

3071
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:29,118
counter-intuitive

3072
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:31,198
when you harvest your plants for seeds

3073
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:33,759
as opposed to harvesting it for

3074
01:58:31,198 --> 01:58:34,559
uh you know the cannabis content uh you

3075
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:36,480
know

3076
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,000
how do those seeds normally grow we you

3077
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:39,759
know we tend to take those seeds right

3078
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,399
away do we let the plant fall to the

3079
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:44,159
ground you know and you know

3080
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:46,238
prepare the seed even more for growth

3081
01:58:44,158 --> 01:58:48,399
etc you know it's something to be

3082
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:51,678
thinking about because there's bacteria

3083
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:53,439
everywhere and they're so important uh

3084
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:55,199
so i you know i like the idea of letting

3085
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:57,439
my letting my

3086
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,519
plants mature to the point where the the

3087
01:58:57,439 --> 01:59:01,279
flowers fall off and the seeds get a

3088
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:02,880
little dirty in the soil and you know

3089
01:59:01,279 --> 01:59:04,559
they pick up a little bit more bacteria

3090
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,719
there's there it's kind of an

3091
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,320
interesting stuff and and but it's just

3092
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,079
thinking of the seeds by the way we did

3093
01:59:08,319 --> 01:59:12,479
we talked about the

3094
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:14,559
because you mentioned the heat

3095
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:16,959
you know the idea that we dry our seeds

3096
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,639
out we usually put seas into a jar we

3097
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:22,079
put in this little packet that we got

3098
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:23,760
from an old film canister or or a boveda

3099
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:26,158
you know to to

3100
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:28,000
dry out the uh uh you know oh you're

3101
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:29,598
from a dessert yeah desiccant yeah

3102
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,359
dessicant you know and we don't want to

3103
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:33,360
do that we want we want those bacteria

3104
01:59:31,359 --> 01:59:34,880
to live they're living inside those

3105
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:36,158
those seeds now we don't want them to

3106
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:38,319
live to the point where they cause

3107
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:40,000
germination uh you know or where they

3108
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:42,960
multiply like crazy and cause things to

3109
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,039
go nuts inside the seed but those seed

3110
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,719
coats actually let in oxygen a little

3111
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:50,639
bit of moisture so we don't want to let

3112
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:53,599
the seeds sit in hot and in in dry dry

3113
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:55,440
situations uh one of the things i sort

3114
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:56,800
of picked up out of the book so where

3115
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:57,919
would you yeah well that was headed

3116
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,760
there anyway

3117
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:02,158
how would you recommend storing them

3118
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:04,880
then uh you know most people keep them

3119
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:08,960
either in the fridge or the freezer to

3120
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:10,560
to kind of stall biological activity um

3121
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,079
what are your thoughts

3122
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:13,920
well you know i think the fridge is

3123
02:00:12,079 --> 02:00:15,519
probably okay freezer i don't know

3124
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,039
whether that's that's so good and again

3125
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:19,679
so again you know the ultimate answer is

3126
02:00:17,039 --> 02:00:21,920
research um uh

3127
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:24,079
i just keep mine at room temperature in

3128
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:26,399
a in the container that's not

3129
02:00:24,079 --> 02:00:29,198
necessarily fully airtight

3130
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:30,799
not necessarily fully airtight or if i

3131
02:00:29,198 --> 02:00:32,399
keep it or if i keep it in something

3132
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:36,719
like a film cam you know an old film

3133
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:36,719
canister uh i don't use a dissicant

3134
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:39,199
um

3135
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,960
so

3136
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:42,719
as like

3137
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,118
i want to hit one one one thing that you

3138
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:47,118
just said about having the seeds drop to

3139
02:00:45,118 --> 02:00:47,839
the ground right and and

3140
02:00:47,118 --> 02:00:49,118
and

3141
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,639
i understand already that you're

3142
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:52,479
probably going to say the answer is more

3143
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:54,560
research so

3144
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:57,039
your your thought process through that

3145
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:59,679
is that um uh

3146
02:00:57,039 --> 02:01:02,800
when we are making seeds in sterile

3147
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:03,599
environments we might be missing out on

3148
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:06,400
some

3149
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:09,199
um you know bacterial or fungal or some

3150
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:12,238
kind of protections that come from

3151
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:15,279
the the the seeds

3152
02:01:12,238 --> 02:01:18,399
falling either out of the flower or the

3153
02:01:15,279 --> 02:01:22,238
plant collapsing onto the ground and

3154
02:01:18,399 --> 02:01:25,039
then interacting with the biology of the

3155
02:01:22,238 --> 02:01:27,439
of the topsoil is i think that's where

3156
02:01:25,039 --> 02:01:28,800
you're headed with it and yeah and if

3157
02:01:27,439 --> 02:01:31,519
we're in if we're you know if we're kind

3158
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:35,360
of stacking your estimated guesses right

3159
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:37,119
now um uh uh do you have ideas of what

3160
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:39,920
those would be like do you think they

3161
02:01:37,118 --> 02:01:41,839
would be more bacterial or more fungal

3162
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,039
well like what are you you've researched

3163
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,319
both what are your riff yeah what are

3164
02:01:43,039 --> 02:01:47,118
you going to riff on i think they i

3165
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:47,118
think they'd be both

3166
02:01:47,279 --> 02:01:51,359
i think they'd be both

3167
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:53,920
uh you know it's interesting some of the

3168
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:57,039
uh some of the razzafashi uh

3169
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:58,560
microorganisms in addition to bacteria

3170
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:00,960
are yeasts

3171
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:02,560
which are fungi um it's kind of

3172
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:05,279
interesting they go through the same

3173
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:07,840
thing and in fact they they bleed they

3174
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:10,719
they bud as they reproduce that's what

3175
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:13,520
happens to these l forms they bud like

3176
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:15,520
like like uh uh fungi in the stuff

3177
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:16,840
there's there's so much stuff here

3178
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:18,560
it just drives me

3179
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:20,480
crazy word

3180
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:22,080
is worth pointing out it's it and you

3181
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:24,238
didn't say bleed

3182
02:02:22,079 --> 02:02:25,279
it's actually bleeding and when i read

3183
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:27,279
it in the book i'm like well that

3184
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:29,039
there's a there's a weird word

3185
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:31,679
yeah there's a couple of good crossword

3186
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:34,639
words in this book uh not to mention all

3187
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:36,880
of the bacterium and and and i i i think

3188
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:39,118
i should mention just quickly that

3189
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:41,359
there are these bacteria names are so

3190
02:02:39,118 --> 02:02:44,079
hard to pronounce uh there's so many

3191
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:45,920
different ones uh you know that i go out

3192
02:02:44,079 --> 02:02:47,760
of my way to tell people don't memorize

3193
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:49,199
anything by the time you get to the end

3194
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,520
of the book you get a little bit better

3195
02:02:49,198 --> 02:02:53,279
familiarity the stuff is in the book

3196
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,920
when you when you need to look it up you

3197
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:57,519
can go look it up where we're headed i

3198
02:02:55,920 --> 02:03:00,480
think is a situation where we're going

3199
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:03,199
to have labels for products that we're

3200
02:03:00,479 --> 02:03:05,279
going to be able to buy that can contain

3201
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:06,559
various different kinds of bacteria and

3202
02:03:05,279 --> 02:03:08,000
hopefully you'll be able to go to the

3203
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:10,880
index of the book and say yeah that's

3204
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,079
the one i want um it's coming there's no

3205
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:15,279
question that's coming i mean you can

3206
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:16,639
buy azo beryllium now i mean there's a

3207
02:03:15,279 --> 02:03:19,198
bunch of these things that i mentioned

3208
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:21,440
in the book that you can buy on a farmer

3209
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:23,598
level you and i have trouble finding

3210
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:25,759
them but it's beginning to trickle down

3211
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:28,480
into this area and as more and more

3212
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:29,840
people including farmers understand rise

3213
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:31,759
of fashion more and more of this stuff

3214
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:33,760
will become available and used in

3215
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:34,880
general farming and gardening and

3216
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,280
growing

3217
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:39,520
you mentioned this aside uh in the book

3218
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:41,840
you said that um you're talking about

3219
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:44,719
fertilizers in general and you point out

3220
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:46,960
that phosphorus is no longer allowed in

3221
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:50,078
many formulations and then you say bye

3222
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:52,880
bye npk fertilizers question mark so so

3223
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:55,359
tell us a little about that i had not

3224
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:56,960
since i don't use them i didn't really i

3225
02:03:55,359 --> 02:03:59,519
wasn't aware sure

3226
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:02,719
sure well we're reaching feet uh peak

3227
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:04,480
phosphate uh phosphorus uh on this earth

3228
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:07,198
uh some people think we again you know

3229
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:08,479
60 70 years left um

3230
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:11,359
and and

3231
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:13,039
partly as a result of that partly as a

3232
02:04:11,359 --> 02:04:16,078
result of the fact that phosphorus has

3233
02:04:13,039 --> 02:04:19,599
caused so much pollution in terms of our

3234
02:04:16,078 --> 02:04:21,439
water systems and eutrophication etc etc

3235
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:24,480
and partly because

3236
02:04:21,439 --> 02:04:26,559
it's so locked up in the soil so quickly

3237
02:04:24,479 --> 02:04:29,118
that are many people's soil already

3238
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:31,920
contains phosphorus you can no longer

3239
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:34,639
buy lawn food in i think almost every

3240
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:36,560
state with a middle number that's not

3241
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:38,400
zero

3242
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:40,079
that you just can't buy there's no

3243
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:42,158
phosphorous long food anymore they've

3244
02:04:40,078 --> 02:04:43,840
taken that middle number out

3245
02:04:42,158 --> 02:04:45,920
um

3246
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:48,639
it's for for the reasons to mention it's

3247
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:50,078
a waste uh it's already there uh and

3248
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:53,400
we're running out of it

3249
02:04:50,078 --> 02:04:55,039
so so it's it's fascinating now the endo

3250
02:04:53,399 --> 02:04:57,279
endophytic

3251
02:04:55,039 --> 02:05:00,238
situation enhances so some of these

3252
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:04,559
bacteria as we noted before are are are

3253
02:05:00,238 --> 02:05:07,118
phosphates uh solubilizing uh uh uh and

3254
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:08,719
encouraging uh the use of or the

3255
02:05:07,118 --> 02:05:11,279
breakdown of phosphate bring them into

3256
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:13,679
the fungi et cetera et cetera so we're

3257
02:05:11,279 --> 02:05:16,238
going to get our phosphates as a result

3258
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:18,880
of our fungi and our bacteria

3259
02:05:16,238 --> 02:05:21,039
so so as far as like final thoughts go

3260
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:23,199
jeff you know i was going to set you up

3261
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:24,880
here at the end um with what you

3262
02:05:23,198 --> 02:05:27,359
actually ended up opening the interview

3263
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:29,039
with about um teaching bacteria in

3264
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:30,479
schools and how they

3265
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:32,639
they taught they teach so much about

3266
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:35,598
dinosaurs and yet we don't have those

3267
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:38,639
except for maybe chickens and uh and yet

3268
02:05:35,599 --> 02:05:40,719
um and yet you know bacteria is is

3269
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:43,679
everywhere and and kids don't learn

3270
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:45,679
anything about it really and so um i

3271
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:47,279
just wanted to know i think i know that

3272
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:49,279
uh you are

3273
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:51,279
having read the book and and it really

3274
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:54,000
does capture your personality i mean

3275
02:05:51,279 --> 02:05:56,319
there's so many so many jokes and puns

3276
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,840
and offhand things here and there you

3277
02:05:56,319 --> 02:05:59,759
can really tell that when you write a

3278
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:03,119
book you really embrace it and become it

3279
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:05,760
and so um so so to to wrap up i just

3280
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:07,679
want to hear um you know what your

3281
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:08,400
message is about

3282
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:12,319
the

3283
02:06:08,399 --> 02:06:15,039
the realization that the um um uh

3284
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:16,399
rhizophages cycle exists coming since

3285
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:19,920
2008

3286
02:06:16,399 --> 02:06:23,039
and our new awareness of bacteria from

3287
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,880
uh from uh from james white that like

3288
02:06:23,039 --> 02:06:27,198
he's had you know having a hard time

3289
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:29,520
getting the message out and yet now here

3290
02:06:27,198 --> 02:06:32,479
your book is going to present

3291
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:34,719
bacteria in living soil and its role in

3292
02:06:32,479 --> 02:06:37,598
the soil food web in a way that's going

3293
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:39,760
to reach an entirely different audience

3294
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:42,719
as the other books in your series have

3295
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:44,880
done so so when you want you wrap us up

3296
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:46,319
with a summation here of your thoughts

3297
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,880
and your vibes

3298
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:50,960
sure well you know this book was so much

3299
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:53,760
fun to write because it was such new

3300
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:55,439
information to me uh and and and i'm

3301
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:58,079
just a gardener i mean you know i write

3302
02:06:55,439 --> 02:06:59,839
these books for gardeners you and me and

3303
02:06:58,078 --> 02:07:02,559
cannabis growers or gardeners et cetera

3304
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:04,639
et cetera uh and i just the more i got

3305
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:06,639
into it the more excited i got about it

3306
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:08,319
partly because i don't know anything

3307
02:07:06,639 --> 02:07:10,400
about bacteria you know i didn't learn

3308
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:11,840
an awful lot they're just too damn small

3309
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:14,559
for people to study in high school

3310
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:18,000
that's the thing so so when i came

3311
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:21,840
across a quote uh from a song by a guy

3312
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:24,158
named andy mckinnon uh mckinnon uh from

3313
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:26,880
seattle he uh i think he's from seattle

3314
02:07:24,158 --> 02:07:30,078
he's the washington state native plant

3315
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:32,800
society member uh it sort of encap

3316
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:35,679
encapsulated everything for me and

3317
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:38,320
lately i've been catching my wife going

3318
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:39,520
around singing this little this little

3319
02:07:38,319 --> 02:07:42,319
little

3320
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:45,440
and it goes i feel it in my branches i

3321
02:07:42,319 --> 02:07:48,719
feel it in my roots endophytes are in me

3322
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:50,879
from my flowers to my roots and they are

3323
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:54,158
they're everywhere and because they're

3324
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:56,960
small bacterium there's billions of them

3325
02:07:54,158 --> 02:07:59,118
everywhere and they're doing so much

3326
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:00,719
important work that we don't know about

3327
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:04,719
and can't see

3328
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:07,198
uh but we can feel that it's going on

3329
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:10,158
and so it's really really important that

3330
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:13,279
we as as growers

3331
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:15,359
carry that feeling forward i mean what

3332
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:17,679
what i try to get people to do is pay

3333
02:08:15,359 --> 02:08:21,679
attention to these unusual things that

3334
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:24,480
are going on inside plants these are not

3335
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:26,560
dumb inanimate telephone poles sitting

3336
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:29,279
in the ground just because they can't

3337
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:31,199
walk and run and punch people in the

3338
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:33,840
face and do all this doesn't mean that

3339
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:36,638
they're these stupid inanimate objects

3340
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:39,119
they're fascinating and they've learned

3341
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:41,679
to cooperate with the microbes and the

3342
02:08:39,118 --> 02:08:43,039
bacteria is one of you know the the main

3343
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:46,639
one that i'm talking about obviously in

3344
02:08:43,039 --> 02:08:48,238
the book in a way that is so fascinating

3345
02:08:46,639 --> 02:08:50,560
that it makes them

3346
02:08:48,238 --> 02:08:52,319
different entities you know there the

3347
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:54,320
you know you shouldn't be looking at

3348
02:08:52,319 --> 02:08:56,719
your plant for the flower

3349
02:08:54,319 --> 02:08:58,960
or for the leaf uh you should be looking

3350
02:08:56,719 --> 02:09:01,920
at your plant for the processes that go

3351
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:03,760
on that make that flower and make that

3352
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:04,639
leaf that's what that's what it's all

3353
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:08,480
about

3354
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:10,560
not the end result that you can harvest

3355
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:13,839
thank you so much jeff for returning to

3356
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:16,079
shaping fire i always have a great time

3357
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:18,639
whenever we talk whether or not it's you

3358
02:09:16,078 --> 02:09:20,639
know at a conference or or somewhere

3359
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:22,560
where our paths cross or or the times

3360
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:25,440
that we you know we really focus and

3361
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:28,239
talk like this um it's always such a joy

3362
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:31,678
i i had this smile on my face throughout

3363
02:09:28,238 --> 02:09:33,279
you know almost the entire time and um

3364
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:35,599
and and thank you for the role you

3365
02:09:33,279 --> 02:09:37,439
played in translating a lot of this

3366
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:40,000
heavy duty science

3367
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:42,719
into terms and stories and anecdotes

3368
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,479
that uh lay folk like me who are very

3369
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:48,078
interested but don't have a hard science

3370
02:09:44,479 --> 02:09:50,399
background um are able to enjoy it

3371
02:09:48,078 --> 02:09:53,519
ourselves so that we can use it you know

3372
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:55,279
for our gardens to to grow medicine and

3373
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:57,440
for the you know regenerative good of

3374
02:09:55,279 --> 02:09:58,800
the planet so thank you my friend

3375
02:09:57,439 --> 02:10:01,359
yeah i certainly appreciate the

3376
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:03,679
opportunity we always have a great time

3377
02:10:01,359 --> 02:10:05,920
and i look forward to doing it again as

3378
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:08,078
people develop more questions and as

3379
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:10,480
more and more information is discovered

3380
02:10:08,078 --> 02:10:14,078
about these endophytic bacteria

3381
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:17,198
fantastic all right so um if this is

3382
02:10:14,078 --> 02:10:19,599
your first time learning of uh jeff

3383
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:22,559
lowenfeld's you are probably not

3384
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:24,800
following his instagram yet which is one

3385
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:27,199
of the best ways jeff doesn't have like

3386
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:29,199
a huge online life

3387
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:32,799
but if you want to follow along it is a

3388
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:36,319
good place to go and jeff's instagram is

3389
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:39,039
gardner jeff really simple gardener jeff

3390
02:10:36,319 --> 02:10:40,880
but more importantly uh now perhaps you

3391
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:43,279
would like to read the book which like i

3392
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:45,840
said we're really you know we kind of

3393
02:10:43,279 --> 02:10:47,679
hit it superficially yet lovingly in

3394
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:50,480
this uh you know a little bit more than

3395
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:53,920
an hour and a half and if you want to

3396
02:10:50,479 --> 02:10:56,158
get it um you can get it on amazon now

3397
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:58,399
it is in uh pre-release so i guess

3398
02:10:56,158 --> 02:11:00,158
they're like pre-orders right now um it

3399
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:04,158
actually comes out physically on

3400
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:07,198
september 27th and the the title of it

3401
02:11:04,158 --> 02:11:09,759
is teeming with bacteria

3402
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:11,839
and um and and so you can just search

3403
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:14,079
that but uh sometimes it doesn't come up

3404
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:16,639
as quickly in the search box since it

3405
02:11:14,078 --> 02:11:18,719
hasn't been released yet so there's also

3406
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:21,199
a direct link on the shaping fire

3407

website for this episode

3408
02:11:21,198 --> 02:11:26,000
that's teeming with bacteria and while

3409
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:29,039
you're there if you'd have not read them

3410
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,719

teeming with microbes then teeming with

3414
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:41,199
nutrients and then teaming with fungi
