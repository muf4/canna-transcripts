1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,220
hey this is Shango I'm at the Washington

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,589
coast this weekend sampling five

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:09,779
different outdoor growers that I picked

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,730
up at Emerald cup from the Emerald

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,919
triangle area from this past summer and

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,460
I noticed something that four of the

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:20,219
five companies were selling their stuff

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,010
in mason jars right which you know this

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,799
this for example this flower from

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,480
scarlet fire is fabulous right and it's

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,640
in a mason jar which has been totally

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,899
perfectly appropriate for medical until

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,049
now you know they're great for someone

14
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:35,699
else's in but but with the new you know

15
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,409
regulated market that's not gonna be

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,090
it's not going to be okay

17
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,648
and so everybody's gonna have to be

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,079
getting packaging and the crazy thing is

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,489
is if four of the five of the farms that

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,170
I'm sampling this weekend all need

21
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,839
packaging that means that there is a

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,510
hell of a lot of work that is coming up

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,780
for designers in California and that's

24
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,698
who I'm thinking about today you know my

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,890
gosh all the graphic designers all the

26
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,349
package designers all like the naming

27
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,480
designers brand strategists all have got

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,280
so much kick-ass work coming up for them

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,079
in the near future right if you're

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,460
already in with cannabis companies and

31
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,709
like you're down with cannabis and

32
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,449
you're an edgy designer oh my gosh

33
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,250
you've got a whole bunch of really good

34
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,650
work to do and I know what it's like to

35
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,090
to be working with a client that I

36
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,009
especially am into their product

37
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,200
whatever it is if like if I'm into it

38
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,060
like like when I write commercials for

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,140
living soil companies right like you

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,240
know people who are like you know

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,228
probiotic I love I love that kind of

42
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,599
stuff so when I'm writing their

43
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:34,170
commercials for the podcast I'm like

44
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,328
into it right and so so same thing I

45
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,969
would think for designers who are about

46
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,438
to be able to enjoy all these these you

47
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,390
know designing the package for the

48
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,459
product and then also designing the

49
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,310
package that holds the product at retail

50
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:50,339
right plus all the the billboards a new

51
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,009
magazine ads and Super Bowl commercials

52
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,960
oh man this is a good time to be a

53
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,359
designer in California so I'm thinking

54
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,188
about you folk today and I hope you

55
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,828
really enjoy it and appreciate this

56
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:04,109
because this is this is a time in a

57
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,629
place in California for for designers

58
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,280
