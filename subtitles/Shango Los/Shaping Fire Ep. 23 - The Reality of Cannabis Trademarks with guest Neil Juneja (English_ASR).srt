2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,550
it's easy to get excited about starting

3
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:13,379
a cannabis business there's so much

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,089
opportunity and many of us have a whole

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,580
lot of know-how that was hard-earned

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,170
during the Prohibition era we go through

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,239
our day creating great products that we

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,760
valued by people and they appreciate our

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,618
efforts there are plenty of landmines

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,380
that can ruin our businesses including

11
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,089
capital shortages bad crops sketchy

12
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,549
business partners and of course

13
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,530
regulators the one problem that most

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,738
people ignore until they are blindsided

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,530
by it though is trademark trademark

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,689
issues suck for most people trademark is

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,189
an unfamiliar boogeyman that we don't

18
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,280
really know enough about to defend

19
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:49,558
ourselves most folks just go forward on

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,660
hearsay and a sincere hope that no one

21
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,339
else tries to use your business name and

22
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,159
that we're not using someone else's

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,350
trademark as well the problem with

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,119
cannabis is that most businesses are

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,090
pulling their business and product names

26
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:06,329
from a prohibition-era cannabis lexicon

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,670
which is very limited as we are already

28
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,099
seeing a business name may be used once

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,829
in California and again in Washington

30
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,199
and again in Ohio and again in Arkansas

31
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,569
these companies may not even know each

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,090
other because federal trademarks for

33
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:23,969
cannabis are not yet allowed simply

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,390
using the USPTO database is not enough

35
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,069
and it is so disheartening when you find

36
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,200
out that you have a trademark issue with

37
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:33,149
another company both companies are

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,280
usually very invested in their name

39
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,950
both have emotional attachment to their

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,280
name and everyone involved is going to

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,450
have to spend money to get it sorted out

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,579
trademarks are especially difficult in

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,820
cannabis and if you want to avoid future

44
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:51,449
pains the time to trademark as much as

45
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,578
you can is right now if you enjoy

46
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,409

47

show Neil all right Thank You Shane go

78
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,349
happy to be here and glad you could make

79
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,120
it so you know before we get into the

80
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,159
questions I think we need to be clear

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,530
from the outset that while you're going

82
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,469
to help make trademarks clearer today

83
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,509
that you are not giving legal advice and

84
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,699
the audience should be sure to do their

85
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:18,060
own homework and talk to a trademark

86
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,738
attorney right right right on goal so

87
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,840
let's start at the point where most

88
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,219
folks first get into trouble you know

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,799
today we're primarily going to be

90
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,199
talking about trademark and trademark is

91
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,170
really commonly confused with copyright

92
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:34,798
and patent so would you clarify the

93
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:37,469
differences between copyright patent and

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,450
trademark sure so why don't we start

95
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:42,060
with patent law so patents are

96
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,819
essentially inventions a mechanical item

97
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,099
or software they can even be something

98
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,159
like a design so for instance like the

99
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,650
industrial design of for the purpose of

100
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,750
this show a bong or water pipe has been

101
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,049
patented and there's even a cannabis

102
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,699
plant patent so plant patents are the

103
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,189
third type of patents and that's called

104
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,439
Ecuadorian sativa by Steve Cubbie

105
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:05,729
currently owned by I either kosher

106
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,989
cannabis sativa a publicly traded

107
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:10,109
company so they're essentially useful

108
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,019
inventions

109
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,970
now copyright is the exact polar

110
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,399
opposite it's essentially creative work

111
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:20,639
something like a book or music or a

112
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,899
movie and now trademarks are different

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,209
than the other two in that they're a

114
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,969
brand and they're not about giving

115
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:29,459
rights to the Creator they're

116
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,750
about protecting the consumer now with

117
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,079
these three areas of intellectual

118
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,620
property there are overlaps between them

119
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,569
so for instance a logo that's a nice

120
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,069
drawing or nice image can also be

121
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,680
protected as a creative work under

122
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,730
copyright but your central protection

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,030
that you're going to go for if you're

124
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,860
using it as a brand its trademark law

125
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:51,899
and so solely what about something like

126
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,150
a slogan because I wrote that so maybe

127
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:58,139
that's copyright but it's also part of

128
00:04:54,149 --> 00:05:00,719
my logo II kind of thing so maybe it's a

129
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,370
trademark okay so it's definitely a

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,980
trademark because it's a brand

131
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,079
identifiers now where it divides for

132
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,439
copyright is copyright has to reach a

133
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,389
requisite level of creativity a modicum

134
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,910
of creativity if you will and that means

135
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,550
a book reaches that level but a title of

136
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,590
the book does not so short phrases or

137
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,810
sentences usually are not protectable

138
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,639
under copyright law man I've had that

139
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,129
conversation informally with so many

140
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,379
people and you just nailed it in like

141
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:32,040
two sentences what other people muddle

142
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:34,860
through blog all right so so our

143
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,980
trademark is our company name the names

144
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:41,009
of our products the logos and the

145
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:44,009
symbols and slogans that represent our

146
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:46,918
company and our product do we need a

147
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,779
separate trademark for each of the

148
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,609
products the company has on the market

149
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,559
or is there such thing as an umbrella

150
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,680
trademark that covers everything we do

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,139
not generally but there's a way to do an

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,090
umbrella protection why don't we start

153
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,490
with company name so a company name

154
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:04,409
isn't in and of itself a trademark

155
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,210
unless you're using it as a source

156
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,600
identify or a source of the goods and

157
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:12,269
services so a common misconception is a

158
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,370
trade name is a trademark the only thing

159
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,639
they have in common is the word trade a

160
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,949
trade name is a DB a trade name

161
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,930
fictitious name and that's really just

162
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:23,849
what you write the checks into so when

163
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,129
people say look I protected under a

164
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,520
trade name that's really no protection

165
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:32,490
at all interesting so you you you have

166
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,788
to both establish your name with your

167
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,590
business license or LLC and then go

168
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:41,399
additionaly

169
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:42,839
and create protections for it correct if

170
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,699
you're going to use it as a brand of a

171
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,149
product then trademarks can protect as

172
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,310
you mentioned names slogans logos they

173
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,689
can even protect esoteric things like

174
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,319
product packaging under what's called

175
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:57,360
trade dress colors as long as it's not

176
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,000
indicative of the product a good example

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,230
would be insulation pink damper

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,519
insulation pink has no connection with

179
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,189
what it does or what it is so you

180
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,620
couldn't get green for the color of your

181
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:13,170
cannabis flower but if maybe you dyed it

182
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,689
a really weird color then that could

183
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,730
become part of your your trademark part

184
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:20,389
of your over arching brand I'm not

185
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:25,259
recommending you do that right right it

186
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:28,800
sounds a the the lion roar or the intel

187
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,750
sound could also be protected it's

188
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,650
interesting because I would think that

189
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:37,470
each of those things had to be proven to

190
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:39,359
the Patent Office when they when they

191
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,670
were first thought of so to a certain

192
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,520
degree your trademark is kind of what

193
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,949
you can get away with in a sense so

194
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,199
there's three levels or three methods of

195
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,240
protection for trademark one is common

196
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,550
law and that's just by using it in

197
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,949
commerce you have some type of

198
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,860
protection in the region in which you're

199
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,349
using it so if let's say you're licensed

200
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,389
in Washington to sell cannabis your

201
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,370
brand protection or common law only

202
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,689
extends to those borders and not outside

203
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:10,649
of that because you're not selling in

204
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:12,660
Idaho so that's the first automatic

205
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:15,449
innocence protection then there's state

206
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,189
law protection which is a really weak

207
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,589
level of trademark protection but it's

208
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,420
also generally inexpensive in the states

209
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:23,310
that allow it Washington allows it

210
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,990
Colorado allows it nevada allows it

211
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,209
Oregon allows it California currently

212
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,460
does not allow it and then you have

213
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,649
federal federal is the big one

214
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:34,259
this is nationwide protection

215
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,179
coast-to-coast and you have to get

216
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,279
through the USPTO United States Patent

217
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,219
and Trademark Office and generally they

218
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,509
don't care for anything in violation of

219
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,330
money laundering or Controlled

220
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:48,330
Substances Act so it becomes a much

221
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,950
higher barrier to get that through all

222
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,329
right so you know I can tell by your

223
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,089
tone of voice that there was a sir

224
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:56,188
amount of humor in they don't prefer it

225
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,230
but at the same time you know I am

226
00:08:56,188 --> 00:09:00,659
really curious to ask you straight up

227
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,678
you know is the federal government

228
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:07,110
giving any form of cannabis trademarks

229
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,999
yet are they starting to squeak through

230
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,039
are we seeing light you know kind of

231
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:14,428
cracking through or is it still like

232
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,078
zero tolerance well it depends I mean

233
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:18,778
the Controlled Substances Act has a

234
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:22,798
minimum THC required and CBD is

235
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:26,850
considered an analog and CBD also got

236
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:28,318
recategorize by the DEA recently so the

237
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,019
trade mark off has gone back and forth

238
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,698
I'm saying look if it's CBD only or if

239
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,318
you derive it from him we're going to

240
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,758
let it through and right now there's

241
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:38,219
been a little bit more resistance than

242
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,289
previously so sometimes you can

243
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,379
sometimes you can but you also have an

244
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:47,219
idea of going for a lifestyle brand or a

245
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:50,548
smoking accessories apparel and creating

246
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,009
at least a a beachhead for further

247
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:56,188
expansion when we finally and eventually

248
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:58,528
and inevitably change the scheduling of

249
00:09:56,188 --> 00:10:00,389
cannabis yeah I think that like refers

250
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:02,100
back to my you know you trademark is

251
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:03,448
what you can get away with or what you

252
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,269
can prove because you know I've already

253
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:08,128
started to see you know both clients and

254
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,438
people that my clients are competing

255
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:13,499
with you know they can't get their

256
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:15,748
federal trademark because these

257
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:18,089
companies handle the plant which is

258
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:19,290
still schedule one and so they're like

259
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,709
they're being they're trying to find

260
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:24,868
other sneaky ways to get some sort of a

261
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:27,058
trademark and so they're they're they're

262
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:29,668
marking they're getting their trademark

263
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:31,889
as like a consulting company or as a or

264
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:34,678
as a t-shirt company or or something

265
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,659
that looks and ciliary that they will

266
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:38,639
then blow up into a full federal

267
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,509
trademark for a cannabis company when

268
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,600
it's allowed

269
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:44,100
you know are you know are my clients

270
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,159
fooling themselves does that actually

271
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,949
buy them any protection I think it buys

272
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:52,649
some protection it really depends on how

273
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:53,878
you're going to enforce it so I mean the

274
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:55,139
first thing you can do is send a

275
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,509
cease-and-desist letter but when you

276
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:59,068
actually get to court your claim is

277
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:01,889
they're infringing my mark

278
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:03,748
well are they are they in the same area

279
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,220
of commerce that you are you're selling

280
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:08,190
t-shirts they're selling

281
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,600
well you know I'm also selling pot oh so

282
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,160
you're saying that you're using this

283
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,600
trademark on an illegal good and you

284
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,939
want to enforce that is that what you're

285
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,769
saying so it's it really depends what

286
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,110
argument you're going to formulate here

287
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:22,159
and and what strategy you start with and

288
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,720
you carry through there's a method of

289
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,009
generally its trademark infringement but

290
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,500
there's something else called trademark

291
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:30,629
dilution through tarnishment essentially

292
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,090
you're using something that is clearly

293
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:35,129
not infringement but it's harming my

294
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,139
good name maybe you're you're using it

295
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:39,929
in an immoral way and whirlaway

296
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:43,019
what would that be I'm using it for an

297
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:45,179
illegal drug well you need to stop that

298
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,819
but you're using it for the same thing

299
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:50,729
and there goes that argument so it

300
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,379
really just depends on the judge and how

301
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,379
you use the Lanham Act Lanham Act is a

302
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,939
federal law for trademarks in order to

303
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,470
enforce your mark so it's something that

304
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,840
you really want to develop the strategy

305
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,700
of from the get-go and carry through

306
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,470
that strategy the whole time and know

307
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,460
how you're going to enforce it yeah that

308
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,170
makes sense because you want to have

309
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,600
your arguments be consistent in front of

310
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:11,610
the court i grok that so you know let's

311
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,379
tease out a little bit more and ciliary

312
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,639
companies because you know a lot of

313
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,950
people listen to the show who have got

314
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,379
licenses but a lot more listen to the

315
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,820
show that are for to use your example

316
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,919
you know making bongs or something

317
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,350
something that is involved in the

318
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,299
cannabis industry but doesn't actually

319
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,370
handle the plant and so they're

320
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:32,789
technically not you know they're not

321
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:35,879
trafficking so so so what about these

322
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:39,179
ancillary companies like do they have

323
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:42,179
the ability to get a trademark at a

324
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:45,899
federal level even though their products

325
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:48,419
are used for cannabis and maybe maybe

326
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,699
their consulting firm and and their

327
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,799
clients are all cannabis some of they're

328
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,160
not handling the plant are they all good

329
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,809
as far as the feds go it depends so why

330
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,439
don't we look first it let's say smoking

331
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:03,299
articles I make a vape pen well sure if

332
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,089
it's used for nicotine we're going to

333
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:09,569
let it through if its main use is for

334
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:11,880
cannabis well no its paraphernalia but

335
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,680
then you have areas that get automatic

336
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,159
first right a First Amendment protection

337
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,559
like I'm putting out a magazine okay

338
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,360
well you really

339
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,129
say somebody can't put out high times

340
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,629
and you're going to get a trademark on

341
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:25,789
that because you really aren't touching

342
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:28,490
the plant here and it's not used in

343
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:30,019
order to break the law specifically so

344
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,490
that would be permitted and then there's

345
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,299
gray areas here and they're consulting

346
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:37,549
usually does work but it varies credit

347
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:40,429
card processing usually doesn't work but

348
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:42,139
it varies again it's all fact-based so

349
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:43,909
what I'm getting from this meal is that

350
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,338
there's quite a bit of hustle in how to

351
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:49,129
make this argument I mean this is not

352
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:53,000
just it's not cut and dry and how you

353
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:56,210
build your pitch to the to the USPTO

354
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,070
there's a lot of well we could go to

355
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,050
them with these four or five different

356
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,040
strategies which one are we going to

357
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:03,799
have our best

358
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,929
you know likelihood of success with yeah

359
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,778
exactly I mean really the moment you

360
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,649
should talk to a trademark attorney is

361
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:12,250
the moment you're going to spend your

362
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:14,629
first dollar on marketing or advertising

363
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,000
redevelop the brand and to go a little

364
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:20,210
off-topic one of my biggest frustrations

365
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,159
is that people aren't creative with

366
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,460
their brands they've got to put words

367
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,980
like 4:20 in there and Mary Mary James

368
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,320
what you know and US cannabis and things

369
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,320
like that and I don't understand I mean

370
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,480
from an advertising perspective it is

371
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,850
not distinctive and it's like everything

372
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,800
else and even worse your consumer where

373
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,470
are they buying your product Oh in a

374
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,000
cannabis shop well do you really need

375
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,070
the marijuana leaf on your product now

376
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,669
they're in a shop that only sells that

377
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:52,070
I'm pretty sure they know what's in it

378
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:53,899
yeah that makes sense you know in heck

379
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,660
that goes that goes along with the bad

380
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:59,269
ideas of the early days of especially

381
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:00,709
medical in Washington and California in

382
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:04,879
Colorado when people would take a

383
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:06,500
pre-existing brand and then pervert it

384
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:10,610
you know just like they do on rave

385
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,690
fliers the classic was the was the mr.

386
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:17,060
Goodbar that was remade to be mr. dabba

387
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:20,660
well obviously you're totally infringing

388
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:22,669
on the Nestle trademark you are so the

389
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:26,208
main defense I hear when people do this

390
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:29,389
they say look it's parody parody law is

391
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:31,250
copyright but so parody is designed for

392
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:32,328
First Amendment protection because

393
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,159
you've got a parody the pie

394
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:36,318
politician speaking you've got to make

395
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,969
political commentary when it comes to

396
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:40,628
trademark law most attorneys will tell

397
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:45,220
you parody doesn't exist it does exist

398
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:47,449
parody law exists in an extremely narrow

399
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,489
setting where you actually have to

400
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:52,368
parody the product or purchasing the

401
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:54,350
only good example for this is a company

402
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:56,149
on the East Coast started a coffee brand

403
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,610
or type of coffee beans called char

404
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:01,220
bucks and Starbucks came after them and

405
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,709
they sued them and the court said well

406
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,589
it is a parody because they're obviously

407
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:08,298
parroting Starbucks and Starbucks over

408
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:11,029
roasts their beans so we're going to

409
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:12,470
allow it so if I probably should have

410
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:13,730
been pursued it's pretty bad for

411
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,920
Starbucks but it showed that you weren't

412
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,199
just parroting their products but the

413
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,599
butt of the joke was who you're

414
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:24,318
repairing right on and I think that's a

415
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,860
good time to point out too that a lot of

416
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:29,479
these folks who are you know coming up

417
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,058
with these plays on a pre-existing

418
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,639
company's names you know these companies

419
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:38,688
like Starbucks they have got to defend

420
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:41,448
their trademark because whether or not

421
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:46,068
you defend your trademark over time is

422
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:48,019
actually a point of fact when you go in

423
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:50,568
front of a judge that if you if you

424
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:52,999
relax nine times out of ten but then the

425
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:54,198
10th one you want to enforce the judge

426
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:56,989
is going to go of men you're not

427
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:59,479
protecting your trademark so really if

428
00:16:56,989 --> 00:17:04,038
you are a trademark holder you have to

429
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:07,610
go after everybody well kind of or maybe

430
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:08,838
not okay you're absolutely right to some

431
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:12,349
regard it's called policing your

432
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:15,048
trademark and if you don't police it if

433
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:17,328
you don't stop infringers from a broad

434
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:18,918
level if you don't try then you're

435
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,959
obviously saying or you're saying to

436
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,579
consumers I don't care whether or not

437
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,949
you know it's my products are being sold

438
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:27,288
that weakens the trademark that can be

439
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,630
used to invalidate it now the level of

440
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:31,970
policing isn't everybody the way the

441
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,820
courts have looked at it they said you

442
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,620
have to police it within your ability so

443
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:38,599
if you're somebody like Starbucks

444
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:40,788
your job is a police it and go after

445
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,619
everybody but you're a smaller consumer

446
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:44,538
you don't have to go after everybody if

447
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:45,829
you don't have the resources but you do

448
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:48,200
have to make an effort

449
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:49,730
well actually that's I can totally

450
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,319
imagine that there's somebody listening

451
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,120
going oh hell yeah

452
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,669
right now because there's so many small

453
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,678
shops right now in cannabis who are

454
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,910
afraid of taking on big guys and they're

455
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,309
afraid of the future and they're afraid

456
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:04,040
of the corporatization of cannabis but

457
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:05,839
honestly so long as they are you know

458
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:08,779
being responsible and trademarking as

459
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,459
much as they can perhaps they can hold

460
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:12,440
their own with the big boys going into

461
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,179
the future and so let's talk about the

462
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,269
future before we before we go to

463
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:19,190
commercial so you know eventually the

464
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:21,470
federal trademarks will become legal

465
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,320
what that looks like politically you

466
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,549
know one can only imagine but eventually

467
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:29,359
normalization will come around federally

468
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:32,629
you know what to imagine it's going to

469
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,269
look like when suddenly the gates are

470
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,990
open at the federal level what will be

471
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:41,839
the of the threshold moment that says

472
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,390
that cannabis trademarks are acceptable

473
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,250
and how do you imagine they will be

474
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,559
determined who gets the mark and who

475
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,839
doesn't because honestly you know there

476
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,539
are companies in Colorado California and

477
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,279
Washington who have got the same name

478
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:57,170
locally and they're all going to be

479
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,639
applying to the Fed at the same time so

480
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,200
I know I'm asking you to kind of look

481
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,670
into your crystal ball a little bit but

482
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,670
but just give me what you got based on

483
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:07,970
your experience that's really

484
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,830
interesting as far as that goes I mean

485
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,450
it'll be a race to the trademark office

486
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:13,399
we're going to look at first use in

487
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,779
commerce is going to be one of the

488
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,880
weights it's going to be where you're

489
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:19,490
located it's going to be a lot of

490
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,780
lawsuits really we don't know how

491
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,960
they're going to do it and there's been

492
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:26,089
debate on this so the USPTO is 45

493
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,360
classes of goods and services from

494
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:31,928
entertainment to apparel to consulting

495
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,369
to smoking articles to pharmaceuticals

496
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:36,860
the best way to do this is to create a

497
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:38,659
cannabis class but we can't do that

498
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:43,399
because we use international class

499
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,870
systems from nice from basically the

500
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,410
world and left for Property Organization

501
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:50,629
under the UN so they're probably going

502
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,340
to allow you to get one in apparel one

503
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,740
in food items there's three classes four

504
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:56,899
food items etc so you may have a big

505
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,730
brand name in edibles and somebody else

506
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,900
has it in flour

507
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,298
they're right next to each other on the

508
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,280
shelf with the same brand and it's going

509
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:05,808
to be tough it's going to be a lot of I

510
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:10,069
think infringement suits will come out

511
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:11,660
oh man you know that's me I know that

512
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:12,829
you don't necessarily want people to be

513
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,808
fighting because I know you're Pro

514
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:16,460
cannabis and you know you like cannabis

515
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:19,819
entrepreneurs and at the same time it

516
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,039
sounds like your field of cannabis

517
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:25,639
you know trademark and patent and

518
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:27,259
copyright is a growing field I think the

519
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,169
best way that people can avoid this is

520
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,519
by looking for really arbitrary

521
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:34,280
distinctive marks that are unlike

522
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,900
anything else for instance I could start

523
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:38,359
a computer company and I can call it

524
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,220
computer companies R Us or International

525
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,869
Business Machines or I can just pick up

526
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,558
a name that has nothing to do with

527
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:47,239
computers like Apple and nobody else is

528
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,609
out there because nobody else has named

529
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,950
their computer after a fruit and I'm

530
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:53,869
going to be good while I grow and I'll

531
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,190
be distinctive and nobody no other

532
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:57,289
brands are going to be anything similar

533
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,700
to mine right on and actually that's

534
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:01,099
that I actually went through that

535
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,830
exercise when coming up with the name

536
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:07,039
for the podcast shaping fire right

537
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:09,230
it is odd words that that feel good

538
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,869
together and the idea behind the brand

539
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,089
was always that you know we've got this

540
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:17,298
this fastburning entrepreneurial

541
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:20,418
activity and way to heal people and it's

542
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:22,339
kind of going wild and and and and how

543
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:23,870
do we shape it so it can have more

544
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:25,939
meaning to humans and when you put them

545
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:27,798
together shaping fire doesn't doesn't

546
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,150
really mean anything and so I guess

547
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:32,240
that's how you get like computer

548
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,769
companies you know purple polar penguin

549
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,259
and things like this people who are just

550
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:38,000
making things that are so unique that

551
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:40,548
there's there's no chance that it's

552
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,619
going to compete with anybody else yeah

553
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:45,319
absolutely there's five strengths of

554
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:47,329
trademarks and you want to the top three

555
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,178
yours are fall under the the third one

556
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:51,409
or the third of five which is inherently

557
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:54,710
distinctive and that's called being

558
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,419
suggestive so here it's suggestive of

559
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,460
what you're doing so you don't know what

560
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,530
it is that you're providing with just

561
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,140
shaping fire but when you hear about it

562
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,058
you get an understanding of it like oh I

563
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,090
see it kind of encapsulates this or it

564
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:10,009
addresses a particular attribute of what

565
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:12,649
we're doing that's suggestive like

566
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:14,750
Greyhound what is it I don't know

567
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,690
a bus company oh you're trying to say

568
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,670
it's a fast bus company I get it the

569
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,789
next level up is arbitrary like Apple

570
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,789
the next level up is fanciful I made up

571
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:26,960
the word it's not in the dictionary

572
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:29,149
there's no way anybody else could have

573
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,579
it because I made it up and that's your

574
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,780
strongest level of trademarks and for

575
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:34,730
anybody who's not familiar with it the

576
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:37,899
cornerstone of that example of course is

577
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,610
Xerox right they made up this word it's

578
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,019
fantastic and everyone knows exactly

579
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,289
what you're talking about when you say

580
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:47,480
Xerox absolutely it's perfect now Xerox

581
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:50,058
actually almost went down to what we

582
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,650
call the Xerox the fact where you become

583
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:57,289
so central to the the product group that

584
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,850
people are now using your term as a verb

585
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:01,129
are you going to photocopy it

586
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:04,399
I'll just Xerox it well once it starts

587
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:07,850
to be known as the the overall term it

588
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,679
loses its ability to be protectable I

589
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:11,509
would think Oh Kleenex would be another

590
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,150
one hey hand me a Kleenex even if it's

591
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:17,089
puffs you're handing me a Kleenex

592
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,830
exactly elevator was a trademark so

593
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:20,629
that's the later so it was one or the

594
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:23,240
other and it was lost because it just

595
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,940
became the generic term for what the

596
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,920
device was fantastic so we're going to

597
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,808
take a short break and be right back you

598
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,519
are listening to shaping fire and my

599
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:34,069
guest today is attorney Neil Jenaya

600
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:38,119
founder and managing partner at green

601
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:39,678
law we humans are attracted the plants

602
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,750
because they offer us relief and are a

603
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,820
whole lot of fun sometimes though the

604
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,950
best parts are buried inside the plant

605
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:48,319
and we need to use specialty extraction

606
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,330
technology when it comes to cannabis it

607
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,519
is extraordinarily important to extract

608
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:54,769
its precious oils without changing them

609
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,900
in the process we want to preserve the

610
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:58,789
properties of the cannabinoids terpenes

611
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,400
and other constituents that all work

612
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,678
together since 1994

613
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,200
Eden labs has been developing extraction

614
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,780
technology and processes to do just that

615
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,640
Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis

616
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:12,920
loving engineer during the early days of

617
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,500
medical marijuana in California and the

618
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,480
expanded Eden team has been designing

619
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,429
and building industry-leading solutions

620
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,549
for cannabis extraction ever since

621
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:25,538
Eden labs flagship product is the newly

622
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:27,489
improved High Flow co2 extractor

623
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:29,679
as other extraction companies enter the

624
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:31,538
market it is the high flow from Eden

625
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,820
labs that everyone chases and tries to

626
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:35,499
compare themselves with not only that

627
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:38,138
but the improved automation software

628
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:41,288
allows data to be collected stored and

629
00:24:38,138 --> 00:24:44,558
studied Eden labs can outfit your whole

630
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:46,929
lab Eden's coldfinger ethanol extractor

631
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,388
creates astonishing whole plant extracts

632
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:51,340
working alone or in tandem with an

633
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:53,528
initial stream distilling step to

634
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:55,378
isolate monoterpenes before extracting

635
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:57,940
the rest of the botanical constituent

636
00:24:55,378 --> 00:25:00,638
Eden offers you many options including

637
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,129
vacuum distillation column distilling

638
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:05,949
stirred reactor units and accelerated

639
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:08,769
solvent recovery when you partner with

640
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,778
Eden labs your lab team is enrolled into

641
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:12,399
the ena labs training program to boost

642
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:14,589
their understanding of Eden's best

643
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:16,508
practices to ensure that your outputs

644
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:19,238
are exactly what you require for your

645
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:22,028
application whether it be dab oil oil

646
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:23,829
for pen cartridges or edibles when you

647
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:26,048
work with Eden you're not just buying

648
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:28,148
the tech you are buying dedicated

649
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:31,929
customer support to help you attain your

650
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:34,238
business goals - you can hear Eden's CEO

651
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:36,700
AC Braddock talk about the company's

652
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:39,819
values during shaping fire episode 19

653
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,409
that was all about co2 extraction so

654
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:44,439
many of the new companies in the market

655
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:46,289
just smell opportunity slap an extractor

656
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,700
together and hire a marketing company

657
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:50,858
Eden labs has been listening to feedback

658
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,409
from extractors and consumers for about

659
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:56,558
25 years now they care about you both

666
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:13,239
striving to reach out to people through

667
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:15,220
advertising we all know though that

668
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,690
trying to reach a cannabis audience with

669
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,579
a quality message is pretty difficult

670
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,090
that's why many people choose to

671
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:23,499
advertise on the shaping fire podcast

672
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:25,388
advertising on this show allows us time

673
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,098
to talk about your product service or

674
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:28,988
brand in a way that really lets people

675
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:31,749
know what sets your company apart from

676
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:33,308
others old people who own companies know

677
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:35,499
that getting in a relationship with

678
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:37,960
their customers is essential that is

679
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:38,799
what we offer we will explain your

680
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,110

681
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,059
and what sets it apart as desirable and

682
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:45,089
help our audience get in contact with

683
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,929
you it's pretty simple really

684
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:49,899
advertising does not have to be all

685
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,519
whiz-bang smoke and mirrors nowadays I

686
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,220
find that people prefer just to be

687
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,500
spoken to calmly accurately and with

688
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,289
good intentions if you want to make your

689
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,210
own commercial spot you can do that too

690
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:03,490

Shango Louis and our guest this week is

710
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,069
attorney Neil Jenaya founder and

711
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:49,690
managing partner at gleam law so before

712
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:53,230
the break we were talking about what a

713
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,539
trademark is what a trademark covers and

714
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,299
actually we talked about several of the

715
00:27:55,539 --> 00:28:00,250
challenges to trademarks and how we

716
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:01,960
might want to think about that so so now

717
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,480
that we're pretty clear on that let's

718
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,360
talk about how actually to get one

719
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,039
because I have helped clients with their

720
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,109
attorneys do this and I've looked into

721
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,210
this for myself and taken some steps in

722
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:15,389
the direction and you know there's no

723
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:20,079
question that it's got a secret

724
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:22,210
vocabulary the USPTO website while not

725
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,099
impossible it is there's so much

726
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,410
information there it can be overwhelming

727
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:28,389
so so Neil you know for our

728
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,759
entrepreneurs who are listening what is

729
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,950
the first step that a business owner

730
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,319
should take when moving forward to

731
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,809
trademark their name all right well

732
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:40,720
first we we did go over this before but

733
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,789
make sure it's a distinctive name work

734
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,049
with your branding people work with your

735
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,430
marketing department advertising

736
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:48,639
Department make sure you have something

737
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:51,130
that really is worth protecting my

738
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,210
general rule of thumb is if you hear the

739
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:55,630
brand you should

740
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:57,970
not know what product it is but once you

741
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,770
do you know either it kind of works with

742
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,769
that or it has no connection to that

743
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:04,450
like Apple from there let's say we want

744
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:05,559
to go through a federal trademark what

745
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,720
you're going to want to do a clearance

746
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,389
search and that's basically searching

747
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,920
all applications and registrations in

748
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,420
the trademark office and is usually good

749
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,970
to do a broader search and just look at

750
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,200
all users and commerce first level of

751
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,269
clearance search is called a knockout

752
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,059
search and you go to the USPTO website

753
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:23,920
and you go to the test the tes s it's

754
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:27,220
the trademark electronic search service

755
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,860
or something of that nature and you type

756
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,900
it in you do a simple search and see

757
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:34,119
what comes up and then you analyze that

758
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,040
and you can look at what classes other

759
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:39,489
applications registrations are in or how

760
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:41,409
common it is after that you want to do

761
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,940
what's called a thorough or what we call

762
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:46,840
a thorough clearance search now what

763
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,039
this search will do and every firm or

764
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,839
search firm will have their own

765
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:51,099
algorithms on how they feel it's

766
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,869
satisfied and we have our own

767
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:55,539
proprietary algorithms - we've developed

768
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:58,089
over years and what you're looking for

769
00:29:55,539 --> 00:30:00,430
is anything likely to cause consumer

770
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:02,619
confusion and that's the test what is

771
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,230
likely to cost consumer confusion what

772
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:06,879
things are spelled different words that

773
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:11,140
may sound the same the first word is the

774
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:14,050
dominant word in most cases rhymes may

775
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,640
fit in here there's a whole breadth of

776
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,629
stuff and the reason you're looking for

777
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,759
this is you don't want to go through the

778
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,470
whole process and six months from now be

779
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,569
dead in the water and you already have

780
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:25,120
your product on the shelf and you

781
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:27,490
realize I now have to change my brand

782
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,039
and when we come down to it the main two

783
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:32,079
reasons to register a trademark are one

784
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,420
you want to know when you're using it in

785
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,740
commerce that nobody's going to come out

786
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,480
of the woodwork and say you're

787
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,549
infringing my brand you need to change

788
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,309
because then you've lost all the

789
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:44,379
goodwill all the reputation everything

790
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,549
that you work for is in that brand and

791
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,360
it's gone and you have to start from

792
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:49,899
square one again

793
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:51,459
the second reason to do this is so you

794
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,440
could do it to other people so you could

795
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,029
stop others from using a mark like yours

796
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,309
so those are the two main reasons the

797
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:58,690
way I break it down so after you

798
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:01,240
complete your thorough search

799
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,500
you know what obstacles are out there

800
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,470
you know the lay of the land you know

801
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,380
how broad your protection can go and the

802
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,230
way that works

803
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,000
is if it's a clear and open field your

804
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,789
protection isn't just in one of those 45

805
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,710
classes it can expand beyond that not

806
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,599
even registering it if it's reasonable

807
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:20,360
for seriesin ibly foreseeable that you

808
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,549
would expand into those but if it's a

809
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,649
very crowded field you may be able to

810
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,879
wedge it in on one of the classes but

811
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,130
you're not gonna be able to expand to

812
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,780
other markets other classes of goods and

813
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,060
services so it's really important to

814
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:35,509
know especially when you you're looking

815
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:37,429
long distance where your company may go

816
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:39,619
and whether that brand may be able to

817
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:42,230
use in other areas again to use the

818
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:45,349
Apple example Apple music exists in

819
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,720
England so when Apple went with iTunes

820
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:50,029
and invented the iPod that was fine I

821
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,420
could do Apple music here but not in

822
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:54,889
England and things that really hampered

823
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,400
their ability to move forward in that

824
00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:00,350
market under that brand so I want to

825
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,100
talk about the form for just a second

826
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:06,109
because it is a pretty easy form to use

827
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:07,969
but I but because I know that people are

828
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:10,519
going to be going from this podcast and

829
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:13,400
googling USPTO and coming to their

830
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:14,960
splash page I want to just encourage

831
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,330
folks because I've been through this

832
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,539
myself when you get to the USPTO office

833
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:24,319
it gives you a whole bunch of legalese

834
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:27,619
vocabulary about how and why trademarks

835
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:31,269
work and and what their database means

836
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:34,369
and it all seems very very heavy but

837
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:36,769
there's also a little bright colored

838
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,599
link that says if you've already read

839
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:40,750
all this and you'd like to go right to

840
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:44,659
the search form please click here and

841
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:46,670
you know certainly you're eventually

842
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,400
going to want to read that or better yet

843
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,440
be working with an attorney so that they

844
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,330
can translate it for you but feel free

845
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,950
to just click that damn link and get

846
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:57,259
beyond all the legalese because mostly

847
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,210
what you want to do the first time you

848
00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:02,240
are you know considering a name for your

849
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,740
company and you want to run a search you

850
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,870
just want to make sure there's not you

851
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,299
know 8,000 other companies that are also

852
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:09,859
playing with the same name and so go

853
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:12,109
ahead and click the go right to the form

854
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:13,339
and and then you'll see all these drop

855
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:15,379
down menus for all these different

856
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:18,259
options it's really easy to just put

857
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,610
your you know word or three in the box

858
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:21,589
and hit Search

859
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:24,199
we'll come back with totally valid

860
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:26,029
results it is amazing how many clients

861
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,850
I've worked with who felt this was very

862
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:31,579
imposing because the US trade and Patent

863
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:34,129
Office is imposing but at the same time

864
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:38,928
just put push through the form the forms

865
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:41,660
bark is a lot worse than its bite so so

866
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:44,030
Neal what happens if I put in the name

867
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,340
of my company or the new product named

868
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:48,619
I'm planning on using and and oh my god

869
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:50,329
other companies come up well from that

870
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:52,399
point so there's three types of searches

871
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:54,439
on the test there's a simple structured

872
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,360
and free form so you're probably using a

873
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,798
simple search now with the structured

874
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,329
you can do a little bit more complicated

875
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:01,819
stuff same with the free form

876
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:04,548
it's almost boolean what's boolean but

877
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:06,200
it's not the same syntax as Google so

878
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:07,879
you'll want to actually Google notice

879
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,820
I'm using the brand as a verb you'll

880
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,440
forfeit the way that the reason that

881
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,850
works with Google is we all know it's a

882
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,289
Google search engine you're not going to

883
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:20,779
Bing so you'll want to Google different

884
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,969
methods of search syntax to really get

885
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,560
it a little bit more deep into it but

886
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:26,689
when you do this and it comes up with

887
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:30,108
let's say 50 results the key is to

888
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,590
analyze those results look at how close

889
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:34,940
they they resemble what you're doing

890
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:39,010
would it be likely to cost consumer

891
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:42,230
confusion that's the legal test look at

892
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,030
the file wrapper or the prosecution

893
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:47,480
history and say how did the examiner

894
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:49,129
treat this - they find a reason to

895
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,320
reject this for consumer confusion

896
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:53,509
issues or something else and you're able

897
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,399
to start to get a picture of whether or

898
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,150
not you may be able to make it through

899
00:34:55,398 --> 00:35:00,139
the trademark offices whole process

900
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,340
definitely I think at that point you'd

901
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,739
probably want to talk to a lawyer that

902
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,289
has experience for instance I can glance

903
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:08,000
it you know our analysis and know what

904
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:10,309
actually is going to be an obstacle out

905
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,170
of our searches of you know my guys will

906
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:13,909
give me a hundred of them with all the

907
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,099
data and I'll just be able to look at

908
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:17,509
that two-page read out and say all right

909
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:20,269
we have one that's going to be an issue

910
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,980
so if there is definitely some growth

911
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:24,710
with the experience but let's say you

912
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,630
decide to proceed on or you say screw it

913
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,039
I'm just going to file it and see what

914
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,650
happens

915
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:33,019
the actual form that you enter into is

916
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,869
pretty handy it as Hotline

917
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:37,940
sonot they go to the TM EP and that's

918
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,509
the trademark manual of examination

919
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,970
procedure

920
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,130
it's the bulky book that the examiners

921
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:44,839
use in order to know if your trademark

922
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,539
should go through or not and the beauty

923
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:50,930
of that is that hot links you to every

924
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:53,659
regulation every word of the code is in

925
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:56,119
there and it also gives you the case

926
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:58,309
sites so you can say why is this oh

927
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,199
here's a case right here I don't have to

928
00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:02,329
do legal research and you can go into

929
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,819
the case and look at the legal holding

930
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:07,210
the rule that is applied and say well I

931
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,500
fit within that I don't I can argue that

932
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,530
so that's how you'd fill out the form

933
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,119
and you just follow the process file it

934
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:16,040
three to four months later roughly an

935
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:18,639
examiner will pick it up they'll allow

936
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:21,019
it to go through or they would reject it

937
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,609
if they reject it you get an office

938
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:24,559
action you have six months to respond

939
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,280
and you respond Controlled Substances

940
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,599
Act well this is why it isn't or I'm

941
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,660
just going to ignore it because I lost

942
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,549
I'm commanding it or you know likelihood

943
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:36,489
consumer confusion and you argue with

944
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:39,110
them look you're looking at this wrong

945
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:41,809
look you know this isn't the way it is

946
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:44,300
look I approached that guy that you said

947
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:46,400
I'm conflicting with and he gave me a

948
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,110
document that says it's okay which is

949
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,360
absolutely one method to go a

950
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,980
coexistence agreement for instance and

951
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,140
you take that back to the examiner and

952
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,119
say I guess it's likely to cause a

953
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:57,440
consumer confusion but they said it's

954
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:59,299
okay here's my letter

955
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,599
so these are ways you can get through

956
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,700
the examiner's office and when you get

957
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,230
through that then they the next step is

958
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:09,259
they publish it in the Official Gazette

959
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,909
and every two weeks roughly I think

960
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,310
exactly they used to put out this

961
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:17,210
dictionary size book with every

962
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:19,489
application and people would pay their

963
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:21,230
their attorneys to read the book and

964
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:23,089
every two weeks that just leave through

965
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,429
this book well now fortunately it's

966
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,800
digital and you can just download it and

967
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:31,159
a third party can oppose your

968
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,550
registration and for instance we've had

969
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:36,049
a couple of Fortune 50 step in and say

970
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,900
you know this is too close to our mark

971
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,789
we want you to stop and from there you

972
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,980
can either fight them in what's called

973
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:46,318
the TTAB the trademark trial and appeals

974
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,208
board which is essentially an online

975
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:50,909
litigation so you can submit everything

976
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:52,259
online it's kind of beautiful you never

977
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:56,268
have to get up out of your jasker put on

978
00:37:52,259 --> 00:38:01,199
pants and I am wearing pants right now I

979
00:37:56,268 --> 00:38:04,708
am not so you'd be perfect to litigate

980
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:07,499
bus oh how hard is it - how hard is it

981
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:10,018
to engage with those say for example you

982
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:13,348
said fortune 50 right because like a lot

983
00:38:10,018 --> 00:38:16,679
of folks they just feel that so much of

984
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:21,690
us lies who's got the most expensive

985
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:26,578
attorneys and is is is trademark law a

986
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:30,568
pretty flat playing field or or are all

987
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:31,289
of our you know fears warranted it's a

988
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:34,318
bit of both

989
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:36,599
we had one against a fortune 50 company

990
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:39,420
a few years back and they made a couple

991
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,680
of strategic mistakes and in the end we

992
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,920
were able to get more and more leverage

993
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:46,618
on them in negotiations and we made a

994
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,259
minor change and they allowed us to keep

995
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,690
using the brand on so many items every

996
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:53,489
year which was really a bit more than

997
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,139
they wanted to do so we were allowed to

998
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:57,929
continue using a brand a base I was

999
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:59,368
infringing for limited use and we made a

1000
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:01,259
minor change and they let it go through

1001
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:03,719
now in another case that we're dealing

1002
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:07,199
with right now it's they're not budging

1003
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:10,289
an inch and the client just can't afford

1004
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,420
the expense so in the end they really

1005
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:14,130
just have to change it and I mean it's a

1006
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,349
huge difference now than three years ago

1007
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:19,709
as well because now all of the large

1008
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:21,630
companies are eyeing the canvas industry

1009
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:24,268
so by saying look we're only going to

1010
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:26,789
use it in cannabis you're not here and

1011
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:29,939
that may have flown a few years ago now

1012
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:32,099
everybody knows that's a valid market to

1013
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,858
expand into someday so they don't want

1014
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,630
to handicap themselves at this stage so

1015
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:38,748
there is some negotiation everything is

1016
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,420
negotiable in life everything's for sale

1017
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:44,278
so there is some negotiations with the

1018
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,249
companies it really just depends which

1019
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:49,880
company is right on I want to go back to

1020
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:54,268
when you were giving instructions about

1021
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,798
using the form on the USPTO website you

1022
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:57,868
gave an example of a bunch of names

1023
00:39:55,798 --> 00:39:59,309
coming back and your team would give

1024
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:01,530
them to you and you scan

1025
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:04,079
and you see the one out of the I think

1026
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:06,450
you said 40 or 50 that was going to be

1027
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,250
the problem and so I want to kind of

1028
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:09,899
highlight that because it's important

1029
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,900
because you know coming up with a good

1030
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:16,410
name is hard and I have worked with

1031
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:21,180
clients for you know heck 30 years now

1032
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:23,099
12 20 years I guess 20 years now on I'm

1033
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:25,379
naming their companies and people get so

1034
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,319
emotionally connected to their first

1035
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,400
name and so let's say that there's an

1036
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,470
entrepreneur and they're really

1037
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,160
connected to their first name and they

1038
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:37,730
run it at the USPTO database and it

1039
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:41,099
comes back with all of these responses

1040
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:44,190
it's important for us to say you know do

1041
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,869
not give up right because there's there

1042
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,510
there are ways that even though other

1043
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:51,059
people are playing in the same with your

1044
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,490
name they might be doing it so far away

1045
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:56,579
from your industry that you can still

1046
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:58,079
make it happen yeah that's possible and

1047
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:01,230
that's true now here's where it comes

1048
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,409
into a little bit of a little pain point

1049
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:05,460
is let's say there's a lot out there and

1050
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:07,440
let's say we can get through the

1051
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,179
trademark office okay you have a

1052
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,820
registration you can continue using it

1053
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:13,859
but you're not original right you're

1054
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,720
you're really in line with a lot of

1055
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,390
other names that are out there that are

1056
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:21,359
brands so it lowers your ability to have

1057
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:24,779
a very strong brand or at least lowers

1058
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,760
it a little bit so some options are to

1059
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,720
go for it and just continue marketing it

1060
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,700
and be fine with it

1061
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:31,980
if you can get it through another is

1062
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,539
something I coined harms trying to coin

1063
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,969
a like trademark or goodwill

1064
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,860
transference I may have to come up with

1065
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:39,179
a better name but it's basically taking

1066
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,570
your brand that's already out there and

1067
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:46,619
converting it into a new brand through

1068
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:48,420
slow education of your consumers you

1069
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:52,079
know I'm us cannabis and I want to

1070
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:55,019
change it to l bot or something

1071
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,789
well it's us cannabis as L bot and you

1072
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:59,190
use them together for a period of time

1073
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:00,840
until it's indistinguishable and then

1074
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,940
you can drop the US cannabis for

1075
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,500
instance and L bot I don't even know why

1076
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,630
I came up with that name L bot becomes

1077
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,489
your new brand and because the consumers

1078
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,440
are never confused and know it's the

1079
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:12,629
same source of goods so if you can get

1080
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,730
ahead of it you can sit there and

1081
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,470
spend the time in marketing or just

1082
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,789
selling your products converting it over

1083
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:20,159
to a brand that you could still be in

1084
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:22,529
love with you can have elbod I don't

1085
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,329
know who would be in love with you know

1086
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,070
I can't come up with a good example

1087
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:29,190
right now but I have seen this you know

1088
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:32,070
many times over the years after mergers

1089
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,809
and acquisitions right they they take

1090
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:36,720
the company that's going to be the

1091
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:39,269
primary and then they they put that up

1092
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:42,179
actually that happened with a steep hill

1093
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:44,099
I think in our own industry it was it

1094
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,809
was it was steep hill and then it was

1095
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:47,759
and then they they either merge or

1096
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:50,250
bought out or something steep hill Halen

1097
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,870
and then they dropped the Halen after a

1098
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,420
little while and all of that goodwill

1099
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:56,309
was transferred to steep hill I may not

1100
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,110
have a story right but but generally

1101
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:59,480
speaking with mergers and acquisitions I

1102
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,829
think that that's a pretty common thing

1103
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,230
yeah and it's really the good way to go

1104
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:07,170
I mean the real key here is I mean

1105
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:09,869
especially in cannabis well especially

1106
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:12,809
in every industry just about is your

1107
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:15,179
brand is your your most valuable asset

1108
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:17,670
that's how customers know you that's how

1109
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:19,199
you get a return sale so that's what you

1110
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,030
have to protect more than anything else

1111
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,909
except your reputation make sure you

1112
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:26,010
have a good product but even if you do

1113
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:27,299
if you lose your brand nobody'll ever be

1114
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,720
able to find you again you've got to

1115
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:35,130
start from square one in a sea of hyper

1116

1161
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:15,969
a business owner you are incredibly busy

1162
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,309
in reality you are responsible for

1163
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:20,259
everything your company does you have so

1164
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:22,210
many responsibilities every single day

1165
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,280
that often you just don't have the time

1166
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,039
to really dig into something as deeply

1167
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,269
as you'd like you know there is more

1168
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,519
that you could do to reach out to new

1169
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:32,409
customers and to encourage oil tea and

1170
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,239
the customers you already have but you

1171
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:36,099
certainly don't have the time and you're

1172
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,949
not ready to hire someone full-time for

1173
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:42,309
that role either or you I recommend

1174

1177
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,370
you know most marketing firms are

1178
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:53,590
excited to make your logo packaging and

1179
00:45:51,369 --> 00:45:55,569
website very pretty but they leave

1180
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,789
responsibility for improving your bottom

1181
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:00,220
line up to you they don't want that kind

1182
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:01,779
of responsibility but that is pretty

1183
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:04,899
much the most important part of

1184
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:07,510

1185
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,519

them to your point of sale and keep them

1187
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,960
coming back to you and telling their

1188
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,820
friends no doubt this is a paid

1189
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,099
commercial spot but that does not mean

1190
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,289
they bought my opinion I've worked with

1191
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:22,630
blunt branding on three projects now for

1192
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:23,829
various clients and every single time

1193
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:26,400
they have done more than they have

1194
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:29,049
promised and over delivered on results I

1195
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,510
love how they generate new revenue and

1196
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,150
focus on that as the goal instead of

1197
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:35,890
just making me a pretty logo

1198
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:37,599
similarly every friend I've referred

1199
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:39,679
them to has come back to thank me and

1200
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,480
that just does not happen every day

1201
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:44,089

Shango Lowe's and our guest this week is

1217
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:23,269
attorney Neil Geneva founder and

1218
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,829
Managing Partner at Green law so before

1219
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:29,869
the break we were talking about how to

1220
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:31,069
both secure and why you want a trademark

1221
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:33,500
to begin with but now we're going to

1222
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:36,980
talk about what happens after you get

1223
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:40,670
your trademark so so Neil after I get my

1224
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:42,559
trademark what is my what's my level of

1225
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:45,079
flexibility with my trademark

1226
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,619
am i able to license that to other

1227
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:48,920
people can I adjust it a little bit as I

1228
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:52,699
go

1229
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:55,220
how locked in am i to a trademark and

1230
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:57,649
what can I do with it all right well

1231
00:47:55,219 --> 00:48:00,289
first step is people want to know why or

1232
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:02,780
when you can put the TM or the circle R

1233
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:05,150
I'll tell everybody right now put it to

1234
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,769
M on it basically all the little T M

1235
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,170
says is I'm holding this out as a

1236
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:11,449
trademark I putting you on notice I

1237
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,190
consider this to be my trademark so you

1238
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:16,250
can put it on anything whether or not is

1239
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:18,019
valid there's no real legal basis or it

1240
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,820
really doesn't matter although if you

1241
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:21,860
put it next to the word cannabis I don't

1242
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,240
think anybody's going to believe you but

1243
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,220
when you actually have a federal

1244
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:27,889
registration you can start using with

1245
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:30,379
circle R there's also something called

1246
00:48:27,889 --> 00:48:32,809
SM so there's TM for trademarks SM for

1247
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:35,119
service marks you can use SM for service

1248
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:38,299
but it's not required to Y M is fine the

1249
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,400
rationale being that SM may have a

1250
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,620
derogatory connotation I'll let your

1251
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,500
imaginations work fine with that

1252
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:47,599
so can you license it yes you can

1253
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,849
license it you'll license it with the

1254
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,619
goodwill and you'll have a proper

1255
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:53,239
agreement in place and

1256
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:55,400
one of the requirements and one that

1257
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:57,679
that is often missed is you can't do

1258
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,750
what's called naked licensing so naked

1259
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,789
licensing is I'm going to license out my

1260
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,409
trademark you just go use it for

1261
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:05,090
whatever you want and the reason why

1262
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:07,429
this isn't permitted is a consumer is

1263
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:09,440
harmed this came from a case in the

1264
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:11,089
Ninth Circuit Washington actually where

1265
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,220
there's a wine company that just

1266
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:16,120
licensed their brand to another wine

1267
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:18,679
company and then they got sued and the

1268
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,869
defender I'm sorry they sued somebody

1269
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:22,759
else and the defender said why you're

1270
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:24,589
not even treating your trademark as it

1271
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,120
should be and they look at the licensing

1272
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,740
agreement they said they're right they

1273
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:29,599
just hold somebody to use our trademark

1274
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:31,429
you don't know if it's the same quality

1275
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,110
of goods or if they're even maintaining

1276
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:35,719
quality it's just another company

1277
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:38,030
putting random red fluid in a bottle so

1278
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:40,009
they lost their trademark and they lost

1279
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:42,230
it after they tried to sue somebody so

1280
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,220
it might have been a bad move so you

1281
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,110
don't what you want to do what's called

1282
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:46,879
a naked license you want to have quality

1283
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:49,370
control provisions in there now with

1284
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,230
cannabis rules some of the regulations

1285
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,670
don't allow too much control from

1286
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,590
outside the company so you've got to be

1287
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:58,039
really careful how you write those and

1288
00:49:54,590 --> 00:50:00,320
satisfy both trademark law and your

1289
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:01,550
canvas regulations and Washington in

1290
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,370
particular has been a really difficult

1291
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:08,269
one because we don't even allow easy

1292
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:10,759
payments for royalties so we just fixed

1293
00:50:08,269 --> 00:50:14,170
that in Washington the legislature did a

1294
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:18,320
couple months ago so that'll start to be

1295
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,940
easier in Washington it's pretty okay in

1296
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:23,360
most other states as far as cannabis

1297
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:25,880
goes but really look at those laws can

1298
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,710
you make changes well there's when we

1299
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,309
talked it earlier about you know your

1300
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:33,679
name your slogan your logo so your name

1301
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:35,599
and your slogan are two different marks

1302
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:38,000
you have a word mark and you could have

1303
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:41,119
a design mark which includes your logo

1304
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,250
your colors etc I recommend filing your

1305
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,139
mark your trademark application in black

1306
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:48,320
and white because then it's all Culp's

1307
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:49,429
so there could be some changes but you

1308
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,660
really don't want to change the word

1309
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:52,669
mark and what's you're adding other

1310
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:53,659
things if it's going to be changed

1311
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,800
substantially

1312
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:59,179
you should probably apply for a new mark

1313
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,510
then that's that's really how that works

1314
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:04,489
right on so it's funny I'm listening to

1315
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:05,359
you as a brand strategist which is my

1316
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:07,669
main

1317
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:13,338
stick and it is funny because you said

1318
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:17,480
when you get to add the TMS M or R to

1319
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:21,139
your name and for me I never want to add

1320
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:25,519
the TM because it's visually distracting

1321
00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:26,868
and not as pretty right and so for me I

1322
00:51:25,518 --> 00:51:28,788
would love to be able to have my

1323
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:31,849
trademark and never have to put the damn

1324
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:34,759
TM on there but then again you know I've

1325
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:38,059
always been told that you've got to have

1326
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:40,099
the TM to alert all humans everywhere

1327
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:41,900
that I have a trademark name what's the

1328
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:45,499
truth behind that do I actually have to

1329
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,789
use that trademark the TM well a

1330
00:51:45,498 --> 00:51:49,608
trademark attorney will tell you

1331
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:51,289
absolutely I would say the same but I

1332
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:53,838
don't use it for gleem law and we have a

1333
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:57,589
registered trademark it hurts the entire

1334
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:58,849
simple look yeah I totally agree with

1335
00:51:57,588 --> 00:52:00,920
you yeah absolutely

1336
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:03,680
so I mean where this really comes into

1337
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,349
play primarily is on enforcement when

1338
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,538
you get to damages it's non-willful

1339
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:11,239
versus willful infringement it's a huge

1340
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:14,930
difference in terms of damages but when

1341
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:17,150
you sue somebody you don't you get to

1342
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:18,828
damages in most scenarios because you're

1343
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:21,739
suing to get them to cease and desist

1344
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:23,509
they're infringing mark and if it's a

1345
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:26,358
clear case they're going to see some

1346
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:28,369
desist after you preferably before you

1347
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:30,259
file but after you file as you're suing

1348
00:52:28,369 --> 00:52:31,730
them and you're going to say great I'm

1349
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:32,989
going to drop the case because why am I

1350
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,778
going to spend more money to get to

1351
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:38,809
damages and it ends there so willful

1352
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:40,099
non-willful matters a bit less where

1353
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:41,930
something in like copyright you're going

1354
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:43,609
to go for damages as fast as possible

1355
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:45,858
and you're going to ask for settlement

1356
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:46,460
in trademark you're going to say look I

1357
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:50,659
won

1358
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:54,548
you stopped great goodbye and so it

1359
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:57,170
doesn't come as much in play as it could

1360
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:59,480
so I always recommend using the TM or

1361
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,608
circle R but I can see exceptions to it

1362
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,670
including myself right on great man

1363
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:08,989
that's a great answer it kind of reminds

1364
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:13,849
me of those folks who are using the

1365
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:17,690
legal system and a software patents to

1366
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:18,769
just capture troll and two people like

1367
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:23,360
if you want to capture

1368
00:53:18,769 --> 00:53:26,269
troll and sue people for for trademark

1369
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,340
you want to put TM on everything so that

1370
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:30,500
you can go after their money but if

1371
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:33,800
really you're just in it to protect your

1372
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,900
brand and we all know that your logo or

1373
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,410
your your your company name looks better

1374
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:41,570
without the TM you don't really it's not

1375
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:44,299
a 100 percent have to do thing and

1376
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:46,100
honestly that's that's reassuring yeah

1377
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,560
it's a very least you know put it at the

1378
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:50,929
bottom of the website you know this this

1379
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,799
and this are registered trademarks of

1380
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:53,779
this company

1381
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,250
you know coca-cola I think use of the

1382
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,560
circle are but they also say on the back

1383
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,940
of their can you know this is a

1384
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:01,279
registered trademark of the coca-cola

1385
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:03,470
company so you know I put it somewhere

1386
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,060
it's definitely good I mean I do

1387
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:07,459
recommend using the circle R when you

1388
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:09,440
get a registered trademark but I could

1389
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,760
see exceptions yeah especially in

1390
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,840
packaging you know throw it on the back

1391
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,390
you don't have to put on the front

1392
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:20,870
you're good to go alright so what

1393
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:22,879
happens if I see someone using the name

1394
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:25,789
that I have trademarked

1395
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,349
what what's the action that I take send

1396
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:29,750
them a cease and desist letter and I've

1397
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:31,369
gone through every type of cease and

1398
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:34,519
desist letter in terms of tone and

1399
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:36,289
there's a beautiful one by Jack Daniel's

1400
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:38,989
that sent a letter to this woman that

1401
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:40,789
was using it and they're like maybe it's

1402
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:43,219
a guy and they're like look you're using

1403
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:44,929
it we really like your stuff we're going

1404
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:46,489
to give you a limited license we're even

1405
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:49,730
going to pay to help you design your

1406
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:51,769
next logo and it became viral it was

1407
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:55,400
beautiful so I've gone and tried every

1408
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:58,250
kind of tone from hey we get it you know

1409
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,119
we're happy to give you time to hey

1410
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:01,219
we're going to come and kill your

1411
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,650
firstborn oh yeah

1412
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:06,139
and I'll tell you the nicer you are the

1413
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:08,059
faster they are the lawyer up we kind of

1414
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:10,489
have to be stirred and mean and

1415
00:55:08,059 --> 00:55:12,619
threatened to come over to their house I

1416
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:15,409
the last part is definitely not legal

1417
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:17,389
advice but I mean your side of a

1418
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:19,789
cease-and-desist ladder you you prep for

1419
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:22,699
litigation you expect them to back down

1420
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:25,969
the cannabis industry is an industry of

1421
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:28,689
Fighters oh we've been to the industry's

1422
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:32,029
been disobeying the law for so long

1423
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:32,670
they're more likely to fight regardless

1424
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,589
of what the weak

1425
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,289
basis is so you may want to get ready

1426
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:40,980
for litigation state litigations better

1427
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:42,630
there's a there hasn't been any federal

1428
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,730
litigation on cannabis marks right now

1429
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,750
now it's weird you you're not supposed

1430
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,420
to be able to get a federal trademark

1431
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:51,210
through for cannabis but the Lanham Act

1432
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,099
the federal law mentioned earlier does

1433
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:55,409
allow you to use federal law for common

1434
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,760
law trademarks but you think the first

1435
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:59,338
thing a judge a federal judge is going

1436
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,170
to do is throw it out for legality so we

1437
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:02,789
haven't seen this litigation yet but

1438
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:06,900
it's coming we have seen state

1439
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:08,548
litigation and I haven't seen one of the

1440
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,650
state litigation cases actually be

1441
00:56:08,548 --> 00:56:11,789
determined on its merits but the judges

1442
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:15,030
were more than happy to hear it

1443
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:17,429
so more likely than not use the lab

1444
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:19,559
state trademark law as well for

1445
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:21,598
statewide enforcement's and that's the

1446
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,849
first direction you go at but once you

1447
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,910
file that lawsuit they should back down

1448
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:28,859
if you're in the right so let's flip

1449
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:30,719
that around let's say that it's not me

1450
00:56:28,858 --> 00:56:32,880
sending the cease and desist letter

1451
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,179
let's say that I received a cease and

1452
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,059
desist letter after I open it and I my

1453
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:41,608
adrenaline spikes and I freak out what

1454
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:43,829
what what is my response to receiving

1455
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:45,058
such a letter well first you've got to

1456
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:47,099
figure out whether or not there's a

1457
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:50,579
legal basis are they being a bully or

1458
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:53,088
are they right and we've have some as

1459
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:55,380
far as bullying going is going right now

1460
00:56:53,088 --> 00:56:56,789
no names but there's a California

1461
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,039
company that really shouldn't have a

1462
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:00,900
valid trademark and it's never going to

1463
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,920
hold if somebody stands up to them but

1464
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,630
nobody has and if it's not valid well

1465
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,030
then it depends what you want to do as

1466
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:10,769
far as your resources go do you want to

1467
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,290
fight it invalidate their trademark in

1468
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:15,630
the process and that's also a

1469
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:17,608
negotiating point I will invalidate it

1470
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:19,650
your trademark attorney your litigating

1471
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:22,348
attorney knows it so you better just

1472
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:24,900
back down but if they really do have a

1473
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:27,420
valid argument well you should probably

1474
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:30,650
work with them to say look I get it

1475
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:33,480
you've got to give us some time here to

1476
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:35,220
convert over to a new brand you know

1477
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,559
give us six months to work this through

1478
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:40,439
we'll sign the paperwork that says we

1479
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:43,440
won't infringe again and we'll be good

1480
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,030
right and that usually works in six

1481
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,920
months is a reasonable period of time

1482
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:49,309
depending on

1483
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,869
what the product is to a phase-out right

1484
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:53,260
on and I think that it's good to point

1485
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:55,670
out to that just because somebody says

1486
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,400
that you've got to stop using a name

1487
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:00,530
because they they control it does not

1488
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,608
mean it's true I mean one of my clients

1489
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:06,200
has got a legit company here in the

1490
00:58:04,608 --> 00:58:07,969
state and they received a

1491
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:10,848
cease-and-desist from a company with the

1492
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:13,759
same name in Canada that was all mouthy

1493
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:17,869
and pushy but you know it's a different

1494
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:21,069
country and so they they sent back a

1495
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:24,500
strong and well-thought-out reason why

1496
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:26,358
like essentially a few but and then they

1497
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,889
never heard from them again so I think

1498
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:29,389
it's important for people to realize

1499
00:58:27,889 --> 00:58:31,548
that just because you get a cease and

1500
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:32,868
desist letter does not mean that you

1501
00:58:31,548 --> 00:58:34,909
should just throw your hands up in the

1502
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:37,338
air and give up that there's plenty of

1503
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:40,578
room to defend your turf even if you

1504
00:58:37,338 --> 00:58:42,949
don't hold a trademark yet absolutely

1505
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:45,650
there is a common law mark like I said

1506
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:47,960
earlier is good in which the region it's

1507
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,190
used a geographic region so you can have

1508
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,990
two common law marks in two different

1509
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:54,139
states they're both valid and can't stop

1510
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:56,539
the other one from using it as far as

1511
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:57,529
from a little earlier what do you do

1512
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:59,929
when you receive a cease and desist

1513
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:02,030
letter there's a third option and that's

1514
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:05,500
to go to them and say well maybe I am

1515
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:07,579
infringing cannae licensing and I mean

1516
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,318
that was pretty much the only option

1517
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:12,680
they're going to get money out of you so

1518
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:14,779
they may actually do that as well as far

1519
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,519
as Canada goes they just recently joined

1520
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,470
the Madrid Protocol which is under the

1521
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:20,960
UN usually they used to be part of a

1522
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:23,358
different Trademark system but now we

1523
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,818
can use the Madrid Protocol to register

1524
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:27,500
the mark in the US bounce over to the

1525
00:59:25,818 --> 00:59:28,608
Madrid Protocol and shoot out to a

1526
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,679
number of other countries for

1527
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:32,750
registration Canada is now one of those

1528
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:34,759
countries it's a majority of countries

1529
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,349
on the planet

1530
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,849
I don't think Brazil is yet but

1531
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:39,950
basically almost every country is now

1532
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:42,079
covered so that's an easy method you pay

1533
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:44,838
in Swiss francs it gets very expensive

1534
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:47,599
if you're doing 20 countries but it's a

1535
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:49,639
method of registering internationally

1536
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,530
pretty quickly in Canada that's a method

1537
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:53,719
to do it with them as well that's funny

1538
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:55,069
that you're saying that they they pay in

1539
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:57,230
Swiss francs you know it's so

1540
00:59:55,068 --> 00:59:58,338
international my brain was like running

1541
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,429
along with your sentence and I was

1542
00:59:58,338 --> 01:00:01,409
waiting for you to say bit

1543
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:04,858
coin I think we're probably a little

1544
01:00:01,409 --> 01:00:07,139
early for that I hope so

1545
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:09,929
I mean I love to see bitcoins I really

1546
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:11,789
wish these uh these retail shops and

1547
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:13,409
dispensaries would use a Bitcoin credit

1548
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:14,940
card transaction machines and I don't

1549
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:17,219
know what the barrier is for not doing

1550
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,409
that so basically you just run a credit

1551
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:21,088
card it would buy bitcoins transfer it

1552
01:00:19,409 --> 01:00:23,608
over to the dispensary or retail shop

1553
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:26,068
and your credit card receipt would just

1554
01:00:23,608 --> 01:00:27,900
say Bitcoin purchase so I'm sure that

1555
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:30,808
there's folks in the audience who are

1556
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:33,510
you know very focused and excited about

1557
01:00:30,809 --> 01:00:36,300
taking some action on this and you know

1558
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:39,540
we've given them a lot of first steps

1559
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:42,420
but for certain anybody who is either a

1560
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:45,179
going to take their business seriously B

1561
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:47,639
want to get a federal trademark so that

1562
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:50,789
they can expand their brand across the

1563
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:52,500
country and see certainly if they're

1564
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:54,808
going to have any plan on going

1565
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,809
international all of these people are

1566
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:59,309
going to want to get an attorney so the

1567
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:02,040
two things I'm curious about for you

1568
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:04,319
Neal is number one what are typical

1569
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:06,389
attorneys fees for this like just

1570
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,579
beginning stuff just to kind of get you

1571
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:11,279
established with a with a u.s. trademark

1572
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:13,200
and even more importantly what

1573
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,230
attributes should somebody be looking

1574
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:18,239
for when talking to a trademark attorney

1575
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:20,579
you know just like just like I tell

1576
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:23,459
people you know you know interview a

1577
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:25,589
couple real estate agents and know it

1578
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,630
what you want them to know so that you

1579
01:01:25,588 --> 01:01:30,088
know if they know there's got to be the

1580
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:31,980
same thing with trademark attorneys so

1581
01:01:30,088 --> 01:01:34,259
so you know what should somebody be

1582
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:36,000
prepared to pony up financially and what

1583
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,849
should they ask their potential attorney

1584
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,588
well for the first thing I would

1585
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:42,869
recommend not going to one of these

1586
01:01:40,588 --> 01:01:44,009
trademark mills there's a big one in

1587
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:46,170
California and then there's some of

1588
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:48,809
these websites that offer a lot of

1589
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:51,630
different services and they offer really

1590
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:53,339
low prices and that I could see the

1591
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:55,200
compulsion to go with them but there's a

1592
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:57,029
lot of add-on fees and they're not doing

1593
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,500
the proper work so you get eight to

1594
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:00,269
twelve months down the registration

1595
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,949
process which is about what it takes

1596
01:02:00,269 --> 01:02:03,750
eight to twelve months on a good day if

1597
01:02:01,949 --> 01:02:05,639
you have no issues and now you don't

1598
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:07,588
have a trademark and you're out that it

1599
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,338
was only a couple hundred bucks but now

1600
01:02:07,588 --> 01:02:10,409
you've got to start back at the

1601
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:12,509
beginning even worse it could do damage

1602
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:13,139
to your ability to get it in the future

1603
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,670
so

1604
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:17,518
when they bring them to me after they

1605
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:19,798
get a rejection I can't save it you know

1606
01:02:17,518 --> 01:02:21,268
you the whole narrative is wrong we

1607
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:24,778
basically have to abandon it wait a

1608
01:02:21,268 --> 01:02:26,129
little while and try again so when going

1609
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:28,768
to a trademark attorney there's maybe

1610
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:30,420
four law firms that that handle

1611
01:02:28,768 --> 01:02:33,808
trademarks in cannabis right now and

1612
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:35,338
they're all competence but you know it's

1613
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:37,260
going to be fit you know do you like

1614
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:38,699
them it's going to be pricing and the

1615
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,539
pricing could be anywhere from twelve

1616
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:43,949
hundred to five thousand let's say and

1617
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:46,140
some of those pricing is because it's

1618
01:02:43,949 --> 01:02:48,028
not apples to apples comparisons so

1619
01:02:46,139 --> 01:02:49,798
they'll say look we'll do the search and

1620
01:02:48,028 --> 01:02:52,230
file it and it's a thousand dollars Oh

1621
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:54,329
office action that's another thousand or

1622
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:55,980
two thousand you know where we do a flat

1623
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:57,180
rate that includes most office actions

1624
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,889
so it's the only price you're going to

1625
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:00,028
get the whole time but everybody's going

1626
01:02:58,889 --> 01:03:01,318
to be a little bit different but it's

1627
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:04,500
really just their comfort level with

1628
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:06,000
cannabis in the USPTO because that

1629
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,829
should be a specialized field or is a

1630
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,568
specialized field in and of itself a

1631
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:11,789
regular trademark attorney will screw

1632
01:03:09,568 --> 01:03:14,579
this up left and right until they have

1633
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:16,920
some experience in it so that's a way to

1634
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:19,500
go as far as choosing an attorney

1635
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,450
right on and so I guess for my last

1636
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:25,108
question you know we're all pretty much

1637
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:27,960
expecting that at some point you know

1638
01:03:25,108 --> 01:03:30,900
something political whether or not can

1639
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:33,750
us become scheduled to or maybe better

1640
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:36,028
yet it becomes unscheduled or you know

1641
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:37,588
any one of these odd things that are

1642
01:03:36,028 --> 01:03:38,670
happening in our political environment

1643
01:03:37,588 --> 01:03:40,469
right now one way or another

1644
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:44,849
cannabis is going to get the blessing

1645
01:03:40,469 --> 01:03:49,679
we're we're okay nationally what do you

1646
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:53,809
foresee as being the I guess to the sign

1647
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:56,429
the signal that we all should start

1648
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:59,220
filing or you said you said it earlier

1649
01:03:56,429 --> 01:04:02,129
actually the the race to the the

1650
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:04,500
trademark office is there a particular

1651
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:07,680
thing that will happen after the law

1652
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:14,009
changes which is our universal signal to

1653
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:16,348
go and do this now I'd say do it at day

1654
01:04:14,009 --> 01:04:18,358
one and just get started as far as how

1655
01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:21,210
each office handles things the trademark

1656
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:23,639
office handles a different than the FDA

1657
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:26,309
which handles things different than

1658
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:27,118
Department of Justice and they really

1659
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:29,969
just look to

1660
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,979
waiting so when it does get D scheduled

1661
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:34,200
the trademark office will adapt pretty

1662
01:04:31,978 --> 01:04:36,328
quickly or may create its own rules to

1663
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:38,068
follow they may create a new class for

1664
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:40,769
cannabis which is really what I think

1665
01:04:38,068 --> 01:04:42,690
should happen but can't without the UN's

1666
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:44,548
approval the WIPO is approval world

1667
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,989
emotional Property Organization so I

1668
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:47,940
don't know how it's actually going to

1669
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:49,949
come down it's all just guesswork right

1670
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:52,499
now right on sounds like another good

1671
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:54,328
reason to have an attorney so that they

1672
01:04:52,498 --> 01:04:56,179
can tell you - since they're watching it

1673
01:04:54,329 --> 01:04:58,829
every day

1674
01:04:56,179 --> 01:05:00,268
