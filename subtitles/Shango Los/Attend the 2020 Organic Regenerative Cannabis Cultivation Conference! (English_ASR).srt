1
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:10,580
hey there so we are here today to talk

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:13,368
about the regenerative cannabis growing

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,440
conference that that first toured the

4
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:18,109
last two years but now is back for a

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,780
third year I'm here with the designers

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:23,989
and creators of it Joshua Rutherford and

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,089
Layton Morrison and and guys I wanted to

8
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:27,979
have you on the channel so that we could

9
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:30,170
talk about why people should go to the

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,480
conference because I'm a big fan I

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,270
missed the first year but but last year

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,339
I was able to check it out and and it's

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,710
like a gathering of the tribe for

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,510
regenerative cannabis people's so so

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,520
Joshua why don't you go first and and

16
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:46,729
kind of describe the conference and why

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,380
it matters yeah I mean the the goal with

18
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:50,479
the conference really was is to get

19
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,340
people into the you know the science of

20
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,219
organic regenerative cannabis

21
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,620
cultivation and to dig into the details

22
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:59,179
because I found that through online and

23
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:01,339
different teachings different people

24
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,869
were missing different parts and that

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,000
bringing together the different speakers

26
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:06,560
and the different thought minds and

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,368
these different angles that they would

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,409
bring a more clear whole picture that

29
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:14,299
was kind of the real main driver and

30
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,740
still is the main driver but we've kind

31
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,780
of had this secondary mission that's

32
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:19,548
popped up and you've nailed it right on

33
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,399
the head of gathering of the tribe and

34
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,350
for whatever reason the timing was right

35
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:27,079
when everyone was transitioning you know

36
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,399
into legalization that that we needed a

37
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:29,898
place where we could come together and

38
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,579
like figure out how are we gonna do that

39
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,439
and so that is kind of crept into part

40
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:35,839
of the conferences is a coming together

41
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,278
and you know Josh and Kelly the DEM

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,170
collective has been a big part of that

43
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:41,358
and were we're really excited to see

44
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,709
where that goes in the future and so

45
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:45,019
it's really kind of been a supporting

46
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:47,359
you know supporting the community and

47
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:49,368
and holy hell like being in Humboldt

48
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,839
last year I mean all the places but to

49
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:53,388
meet people that have been growing weed

50
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,639
for 10 years 20 years 30 years and and

51
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:57,918
doing the struggle all on their own it's

52
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:59,449
just like your instant brothers and

53
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,578
sisters there's like hugs and like man

54
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,099
we're instagramming about the rain this

55
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:06,318
year and it's just a camaraderie it's

56
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,520
been really cool so last year I was at

57
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,140
Michigan and I've had the same

58
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,090
experience where people I met in

59
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,479
Michigan you know they've got their

60
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,689
unique

61
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,000
community of people and now you know I'm

62
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,829
texting back and forth to them and some

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,409
of those folks went out the humble now

64
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,150
they've got new allies and humble and so

65
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,099
so you already mentioned josh and kelly

66
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,430
from dragonfly earth medicine who are

67
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:32,459
you know we're all fans of but the the

68
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,290
list of educators for the event is as

69
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,469
incredible as it's been the last two

70
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:40,079
years so will you just name drop a bunch

71
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,180
of people who are on the flyer dr.

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,880
Elaine Ingham of course she's the the

73
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,439
Guru leighton-morris and obviously mine

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,560
for my partner and he brings a whole

75
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,269
interesting level Chris Trump we're

76
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,300
gonna have Suzanne Wainwright Evans

77
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,950
the bug lady the bug lady chip Osbourne

78
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,989
which he didn't join us last year but he

79
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,939
brings a whole part of soil chemistry

80
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,069
that's like super handy heady and

81
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,840
supercritical it's we're talking about

82
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,488
the minerals in there that's a real part

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,560
that's missing in the conversation I

84
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,360
think we're gonna have dr. Efrain out

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,269
there and talk about my Oh cries I fungi

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,480

87
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,700
jury you know stoked to have him back

88
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,709
and and and we're really turning Sunday

89
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,929
into a genetic day into a Kevin Joe

90
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,090
today to talk about genetics and to do a

91
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,079
seed swap which has become a huge part

92
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,870
of this

93
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,810
it was amazing last year to see breeders

94
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,360
who were selling $300 $500 packs you

95
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,829
know giving and trading seeds openly

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,030
amongst people you know and it didn't

97
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,090
have to be cannabis seeds there were

98
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,819
there was vegetable seeds being traded

99
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,259
it was so beautiful and it's it's how

100
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:49,439
we're gonna survive and it's how we're

101
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:52,229
gonna a few Philo's yeah so so so so so

102
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,299
so far you're picking up that it's a

103
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,560
it's a real community event it's really

104
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,620
down to earth

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,560
we've got like dream team of speakers

106
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,509
gonna be there but you know when I first

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,849
started posting that tickets were

108
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,560
already on sale people are like oh I

109
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,818
went last year I don't need to go this

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,430
year and I'm like nanana

111
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:14,679
not not only do most of the speakers

112
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,829
will will speak for an hour sometimes

113
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,660
more especially in two hours right on

114
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,819
even if they're speaking for two hours

115
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,880
most of these speakers could do whole

116
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,680
days on their own and these speakers

117
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,879
know that they need to provide new and

118
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,550
different content than last year and so

119
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:37,478
so so Layton I know that you know like

120
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:40,689
you were very clear that these speakers

121
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,699
are the top of the industry so why would

122
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:45,339
we swap them out why don't you tell us a

123
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,530
little bit about about why people who

124
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:49,388
were there last year shouldn't make sure

125
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:51,129
that they're here again this year well

126
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,500
there's just so much new information out

127
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:55,449
there you know the the deeper

128
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,000
understanding of these what I'm gonna

129
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,949
call communities now of organisms not

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,379
just three four bacteria there's there's

131
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:04,000
a whole community of these guys that are

132
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,339
working together and there's some new

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,310
information on f2b ratios which is

134
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,929
fungus the bacteria that's coming out of

135
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,389
Brazil that Elaine learned over the

136
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,819
summer so each one of these speakers

137
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:18,158
every year ups their game and brings new

138
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:19,598
information at the tables so yeah we're

139
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:21,728
gonna be touching on the basics and

140
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:23,978
making sure that the newbies have some

141
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:26,168
point to start but we're gonna be diving

142
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:27,759
deeper into the present information that

143
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:30,158
we've learned over the last year and

144
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,129
these relationships between the speakers

145
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:35,379
I mean that that was like an amazing

146
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,209
thing to put Chris Trump and Elaine on

147
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,829
the same stage together and then like

148
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,329
Friday nights we all the speakers

149
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:42,370
present get up there and Duke it out

150
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,168
because we all don't believe in

151
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,360
everything but then again you start to

152
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:47,799
open your mind saying well I understand

153
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,750
what you're saying did you ever look at

154
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,329
it this way and so there's there's a

155
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,269
whole symbiosis that it's occurring

156
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:57,550
right in front of you as real time well

157
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:59,439
and just to add on it I mean it really

158
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,470
wasn't to our last conference in Maine

159
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,620
that the team of speakers really started

160
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,570
to feel like a team

161
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,040
and break down some of those social nor

162
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,959
and get some social norms and break down

163
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,220
some except for people where some

164
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,079
barriers and you really get into some

165
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,389
stuff and like it's just been very

166
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,899
powerful to be a part of that that's

167
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:21,478
organic yeah it is organic so so so what

168
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,849
we're saying here is that it may have

169
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,339
taken all of last year for everybody to

170
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,830
get to know each other and my favorite

171
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:29,579
parts are when one speaker from the back

172
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,319
of the room

173
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,849
like Wendy Kornberg who's like

174
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,279
constantly interrupting people are like

175
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,699
but what about this right and then they

176
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,929
go huh and so you've got these active

177
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,360
conversations between the different

178
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,579
educators happening in real time in

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,629
front of you and you know what if you

180
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,849
have something to add you can raise your

181
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:49,288
hand and add it to like where the hell

182
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,850
else we're gonna get this I don't know

183
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:52,978
of anywhere else and that's why you guys

184
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,360
pretty much did it right absolutely we

185
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:57,569
wanted to prevent the misinformation

186
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,069
that's been going around and clean up

187
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,439
some of these details so that people

188
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,629
really do have a solid base foundation

189
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,149
to work for which is why the name

190
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,769
science is in the name yeah and stay

191
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:09,388
away from sponsorships has been a big

192
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:11,219
part you know we don't have sponsors

193
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,110
we're paying the speakers the ticket

194
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,750
sales pay the speakers to be there and

195
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,250
we've asked them to be there for two

196
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,990
days one to two days you know they speak

197
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,639
for two hours some speak for a little

198
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,199
bit more but they're there to interact

199
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,930
with everybody and that was really the

200
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,180
goal it was to push us all as the

201
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,978
community and it's happened you know

202
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,629
build the community so that people know

203
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:32,459
that other people are struggling just

204
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,409
like them and they can rely on each

205
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,779
other to work together to get through

206
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,939
this because it is it's trying times

207
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,888
really is and when we first talked about

208
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,689
bringing folks back we I was really

209
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,978
reticent to be honest I was thinking we

210
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:47,189
needed to bring us some some different

211
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:49,589
topics but as we as late in our dialogue

212
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:51,598
that it was really you that just became

213
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:53,519
very apparent that that was it was 2.0

214
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,139
and we needed to try to make that clear

215
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,509
to everybody that there you know Suzanne

216
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,600
has been busting her ass she's going to

217
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,310
school she's going to courses she's

218
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,320
working a ton with cannabis you know

219
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,019
it's it's really impressive to see what

220
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,430
the learning that's going on and even if

221
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,500
there's going to be different topics

222
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,970
this year than there were last year it

223
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,910
doesn't mean that you don't go to the

224
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,010
same speaker on a different topic right

225
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,290
these are all people who have got like a

226
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,300
wide range of knowledge it's not like

227
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,110
they only know two hours worth of stuff

228
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,660
right

229
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,870
I mean Jojo dree alone right Jojo can

230
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,460
speak all two days whatever and and and

231
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,060
and and keep the time full of

232
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:35,509
interesting anecdotes so all right so so

233
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:37,909
Joshua for for people who don't know the

234
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:40,038
reputation already like we all do about

235
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:44,419
the regenerative cannabis traveling I

236
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:47,899
don't know circuits of Roadshow Roadshow

237
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:50,509
that's much nicer um like who is this

238
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,059
for who like like if you're if you're

239
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:56,269
watching this and you're like like okay

240
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:57,619
you know we want to go to something like

241
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,120
this but I don't know if this is for me

242
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,769
who are the people who need to make sure

243
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,600
that they're here I mean it's really for

244
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,460
cultivators and a hundred percent you

245
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,110
know others beginners are welcome but

246
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,389
it's really for advanced cultivators who

247
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,250
are deep down the organic whole and I've

248
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:13,279
been doing it for a minute to up their

249
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,320
game you know and one of the biggest

250
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,730
feedbacks and most impactful feedbacks

251
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,280
that I think that both of us got was

252
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,470
with so many hugs and so many thank yous

253
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,699
and I'm thinking you know thank you

254
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,110
thank you

255
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,090
you know like thank you for coming and

256
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,090
making this happen and people were just

257
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,340
so thankful to be a part of just what

258
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:34,580
we're talking about the community aspect

259
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:37,280
and the the sharpening of steel what's

260
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,240
what it was the same honing of steel or

261
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,850
whatever but yeah I mean again the

262
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,190
they're missing little pieces and they

263
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,769
don't know what those pieces are but

264
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,520
then they start to understand oh god now

265
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,039
I get it

266
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,929
that's why this year I kicked it out of

267
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,849
the park and then the year after I

268
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:58,279
failed was because I missed this piece

269
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,009
so it's it's really sharpening everybody

270
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,740
on a many levels and then they also can

271
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:06,049
get together with the speakers and talk

272
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,350
about their specific needs which i think

273
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:10,559
is really real

274
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,540
valuable for these cultivators and it's

275
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,719
cool too because there's not like vendor

276
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:17,939
booths and sponsorships here and so on

277
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,759
the brakes you know you can step outside

278
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,150
and share a toke with like these these

279
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:26,340
educators and and talk to them and ask

280
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:28,049
them your questions and it's not like oh

281
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,460
they spoke and then they got to run to

282
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:31,379
the airport and they're gone

283
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,470
they're actually there for a day or two

284
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,509
because there aren't sponsors paying for

285
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,370
it your ticket price is paying for it

286
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:40,740
and so they're there for you which I

287
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,870
thought was really cool you know I don't

288
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,580
want to say who I smoked joints with but

289
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,029
it's nice that you can go out with these

290
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:50,400
brakes on the brakes and share share a

291
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:54,240
joint with like one of your heroes like

292
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,590
how bad this is that right yeah so so so

293
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,070
let's talk about tickets so tickets are

294
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,930
already on sale so if you want to go do

295
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,490
not waste your time in getting a ticket

296
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:05,339
but also it's different this year

297
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,440
because the tickets were available at

298
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,450
the door last year none of that this

299
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,400
year it was made for a total pain in the

300
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,840
ass right like in though it's it's early

301
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,569
in the morning everybody's half asleep

302
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,740
everybody was up all night like

303
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,379
exchanging information about

304
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,240
regenerative cannabis none of that so so

305
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,009
this year it's going to be a limited

306
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,909
number of tickets they're all available

307
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:30,480
in advance which means we're almost

308
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:32,730
certainly going to sell out and so so

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,460
Joshua if people want to get hooked up

310
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,820
with a ticket in their City how do they

311
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,889
do that

312
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,890
the website is easiest regenerative

313
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:43,230
organic cannabis calm click on the city

314
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,490
then scroll down on the bottom purchase

315
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,680
tickets will take you to a vet right

316
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,450
right on so pretty straightforward so so

317
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,579
it's easy to buy tickets you go to the

318
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,270
website and the link is in the in the

319
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,560
description below order online if you're

320
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:59,689
like I don't have the money today we

321
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:02,849
take credit cards and and also you know

322
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,260
don't be in the position where you put

323
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,320
it off and put it off and put it off

324
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:11,009
until all the tickets are sold out that

325
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,450
happened you know to lots of people well

326
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,250
not at the event but I'm thinking like

327
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,230
concerts that I got skunked out at right

328
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,450
I put off the stuff forever and ever

329
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,460
until I can't get like a ticket and then

330
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,180
I'm like oh I guess I'm not going don't

331
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,250
be that person

332
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:26,309
right there the value of coming together

333
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,350
as a community and sharing this

334
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:31,769
information and the fact that we're not

335
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,259
alone growing right the idea that that

336
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:36,960
there are other organic cultivators out

337
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:41,159
there who really care about microbe life

338
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,750
I think is a pretty big deal so so $350

339
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,219
will change your life yeah it will

340
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,679
change your life I've been told that a

341
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,300
lot it's it's been really cool and I

342
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,859
don't take the credit to us I just take

343
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,279
the credit to the community and coming

344
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,169
together

345
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,139
one thing I did want to add that I think

346
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:57,179
is pretty pretty vital is we are adding

347
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:59,220
breeder booths this year so we're gonna

348
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,509
probably four or five and we haven't

349
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,269
released the names except where we got

350
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:04,679
hyep Pacific Northwest roots he's gonna

351
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,139
be with us and we're gonna have some

352
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,669
more guys they'll be there all weekend

353
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,189
to talk with you and also sell their

354
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:12,689
gear so yeah and there I don't think

355
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,720
we've mentioned the seed swap either and

356
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,370
so one you tell us about Friday night

357
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,009
yes well we do the seed will stop on

358
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,480
Sunday at lunch and it's an open seat

359
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,860
swap bring what you got bring what you

360
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,070
made and it's actually been a really

361
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,259
cool literal cross-pollination where you

362
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,610
know some guys from yeah I don't want to

363
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,960
start calling out who and what you know

364
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,759
because people are moving these these

365
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,370
genetics in and out of the legal market

366
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,659
yeah but it's it's because you know have

367
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,070
looking for something you know with

368
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:39,779
osmium you were talking about that

369
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,820
earlier and who has the oldest guy over

370
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,009
here how's that go link down him and and

371
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,080
then now it's being grown in Maine over

372
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:47,879
here or up in Canada and it's it's

373
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,070
really cool and we're helping each other

374
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,750
grow better by helping each other get

375
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,820
better genetics right um it's really

376
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,830
awesome and so since I thought that the

377
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,750
seed swap was on Friday but it's

378
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,310
actually on Sunday Friday night is

379
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,659
special to tell us about Friday night

380
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,409
Friday night we have all the speakers

381
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,149
throw down

382
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:04,949
so we bring all the speakers in and we

383
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,379
put them up on the stage and I kind of

384
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,080
foe host it but really it's a live Q&amp;A

385
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:12,269
and we let the audience ask questions

386
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,920
and it it creates awkward moments

387
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,539
sometimes when when Ocwen different

388
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,349
members of the you know speakers on a

389
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:20,669
disagree good we give a beer and stuff

390
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,710
and get them loosened up a little bit

391
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:24,539
and it's been really awesome and

392
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,990
powerful and and and just fun for

393
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:29,339
everybody

394
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:31,889
yes so so if you are into regenerative

395
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,710
cannabis this is not something you want

396
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:35,470
to miss

397
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,899
and the guys have set their schedule

398
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,540
from the west coast all the way across

399
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:43,389
to the East Coast and also hitting in in

400
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:46,269
Canada once in Vancouver and so you know

401
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:49,000
last year people in those cities were

402
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:50,708
certainly there but people flew in and

403
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,620
road-tripped and put together their

404
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:55,599
posse and all came like like this is um

405
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,299
you know this is the kind of thing

406
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,089
that's worth traveling to so you know

407
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:03,939
don't be don't be left outside hearing

408
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,459

409
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,050

00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,129
there's different speakers at each one

415
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:19,870
right and also there's feedback is

416
