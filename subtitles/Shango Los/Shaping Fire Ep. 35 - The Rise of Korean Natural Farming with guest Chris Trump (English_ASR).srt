2
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:10,949
fermenting has become wildly popular in

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,989
the last decade everywhere you look

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,579
people are drinking kombucha and water

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,800
kefir and other folks are making

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,868
fermented pickles and sauerkraut or

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,820
homemade yogurts in each of these

8
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,100
examples the goal is to make an

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,129
environment beneficial to microorganisms

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,960
so they thrive and multiply this is the

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,059
same thing that probiotic farmers are

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,009
trying to do instead of just trying to

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,379
jam the plant full of nutrients a

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,329
probiotic farmer is creating a soil

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,170
environment where life is abundant and

16
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,850
naturally creates the plants nutrition a

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,100
thriving plant comes from making healthy

18
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,280
soil not trying to force-feed @

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,000
nutrients Korean natural farming known

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,480
shorthand as KNF is next level probiotic

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,730
farming KNF ferments a wide variety of

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,819
naturally occurring substances from

23
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,919
plant and fruit juices to fish carcasses

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,069
and sea water in order to help

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,320
indigenous bacteria fungi nematodes and

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,478
protozoa to thrive and produce fertile

27
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,000
soils that don't require pesticides

28
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:15,569
herbicides or synthetic fertilizer

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,759
inputs in essence KNF takes the

30
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,989
principles found in making tasty to eat

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,239
kimchi and reapplies them to the farm

32
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:26,250
master chauhan ku invented Korean

33
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,259
natural farming method by blending

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,180
Korean farming and fermenting techniques

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,209
with those of natural farming teachers

36
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,000
he met while studying in Japan by 1992

37
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:38,250
he had begun an epic 21 part series in

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,219
modern agricultural magazine on his

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,170
newly established methods and in 1995 he

40
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,780
opened the natural farming life school

41
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,579
and research farm in Korea this school

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,710
is the source of these inventive

43
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:53,548
techniques that are taking the cannabis

44
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,739
world by storm seriously everybody in

45
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,740
probiotic cannabis growing is talking

46
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,419
about KNF right now if you want to learn

47

Shango 'lose my guest this week is Chris

62
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,490
Trump Chris Trump is a master natural

63
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,859
farmer certified by Master Choa of Korea

64
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,469
he's also studied microbial analysis

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,140
under dr. Elaine Ingraham many consider

66
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:45,060
Chris's YouTube videos explaining Korean

67
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,939
natural farming techniques to have been

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,490
the key to can s wildly increasing

69
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,050
popularity in the US it's also helpful

70
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,390
that chris is a certified kin of

71
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,490
educator who actually speaks english

72
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:59,369
today we'll be going over the central

73
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,530
ideas of KNF and discussing recipes for

74
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,280
korean farming's exceptionally alive

75
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,060
inputs

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,530
welcome to the show Chris thank I'm glad

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,120
to be here yeah I know your time is

78
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,960
valuable so thanks for appealing off a

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,759
little bit for us

80
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,219
so you know you know as I've already

81
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,349
mentioned to folks I am new to Korean

82
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,780
natural farming I've been in probiotics

83
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:21,180
for a while but but people have been

84
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,449
getting more and more excited about KNF

85
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,610
as the as the teaching finds its way you

86
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,319
know around the scene and so so let's

87
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,250
start like what do you see as the

88
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,889
difference between you know probiotic

89
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,949
farming and living soils versus the

90
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:41,579
specifics of Korean natural farming is

91
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:43,589
it is it simply a subset of probiotic

92
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,070
farming or do you see a kind of as an as

93
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:51,509
its own thing for some reason you know

94
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:55,769
it it's all it's all nature the best any

95
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:57,989
of this is really doing is working the

96
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,650
way nature already works and it's

97
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:05,340
optimum so if some of these doing

98
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:09,959
probiotic farming or living focusing on

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:12,150
living soil if they're doing it well you

100
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:16,500
know that's that's kind of it is very

101
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:19,410
similar Korea natural farming one of the

102
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:24,060
core principles is the idea of

103
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:27,680
indigenous microbes so where you might

104
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,829
buy bugs in a jug some some product made

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,810
where that somebody said it's really

106
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:39,680
good or they found success with those we

107
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,589
found may or may not persist in your

108
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,490
environment so depending on your

109
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:49,159
temperature or your moisture or just the

110
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,160
microbes that are already present you

111
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,689
might have a six month fall off with

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,610
some sort of purchased microorganism mix

113
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:01,129
and you might you might not that's not

114
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,830
I'm not saying that's always how it is

115
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:08,589
but with indigenous biology so if your

116
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:12,948
indigenous microorganism if you're

117
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:14,719
farming a acre of land and you go up the

118
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:18,199
hill and you collect something that

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,729
exists and the wild forest and bring it

120
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:25,728
down we're very confident that that will

121
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:28,159
persist in your soil because it's for

122
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:29,659
however many thousands of years or

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,750
whatever period of time that's been

124
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,360
undisturbed or gotten established it's

125
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,418
thrived in that environment so by moving

126
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,270
it you know downhill or a mile across

127
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:43,009
town it's still gonna like your rainfall

128
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:46,519
your temperature your barometric

129
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:49,908
pressure and the general soil mix for

130
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:52,668
the most part and even play well with

131
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:54,168
the microbes on your farm that makes a

132
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:56,060
lot of sense you know we talk a lot on

133
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:58,250
this show about bio regions and making

134
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,439
sure that you're growing you know this

135
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,418
the strains that work for where you live

136
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,629
if you're growing outdoors and this

137
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:07,189
seems to be a real obvious extension of

138
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:09,680
that you know it's like you know work

139
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:12,168
with the microbes that are comfortable

140
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,650
with your area and your weather instead

141
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:18,079
of you know necessarily recruiting bugs

142
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:19,698
in a bottle like you said to add them

143
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,319
and then just hope that they do good

144
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:23,629
where you happen to live that makes a

145
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,069
lot of sense and so so at the Etha at

146
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:31,009
the cornerstone of KNF would be simply

147
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:33,469
recruiting your volunteer microbes from

148
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:37,330
your neighborhood and then feeding them

149
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:41,180
what they want so that they are you know

150
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:44,418
motivated to stay and to increase yeah

151
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:47,150
and and that's not to say that bugs and

152
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:49,099
a bugs in the jug wouldn't help your

153
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:52,310
farm it just may be that you just got to

154
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,830
keep buying them whereas if you're yeah

155
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,519
if you're establishing something that

156
00:06:54,829 --> 00:07:02,180
will persist you're basically building a

157
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,728
battery of health and vitality in your

158
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,400
soil that will be there year after year

159
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:10,038
right on so you mentioned that as one of

160
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:12,228
the key tenants of KNF would you would

161
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,689
you have any other key tenants of KNF

162
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:20,389
that you think are good to start with

163
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:24,439
you know the first time I spent a long

164
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:27,918
period of time with Johan new Master

165
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:31,149
Choa he we looked at her notes I sitting

166
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:33,680
next to my friend Pancho from Pedro he's

167
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:35,929
the head of Crazy Horse you know Neil

168
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,000
Young and Crazy Horse yeah yeah yeah

169
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:42,590
yeah he's the leaves Crazy Horse and

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,660
we're sitting there and we're looking at

171
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:47,329
her notes it's been a day or two of you

172
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,599
know getting into it Master Cho and his

173
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:53,839
daughter was there do young and we're

174
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:55,879
like every other words love you know

175
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,519
like this whole thing there's like

176
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:04,250
agriculture agriculture love agriculture

177
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:05,839
love and so that's taking me a bit or

178
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,908
initially it took me a bit as a

179
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,728
commercial farmer to be like okay what

180
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:14,449
does love have to do with agriculture

181
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:17,569
and but I would say as far as natural

182
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:23,150
farming goes it is a core tenant in that

183
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:26,538
it's it's a mindset or a position to

184
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:31,638
farm from where if you are caring for

185
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:33,740
things or treating them as you might a

186
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,349
child you know where it's like oh it's

187
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,500
just good enough but you're kind of like

188
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:45,040
no let me practice or learn to do this

189
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:48,379
well there's there's a result that is

190
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:51,528
has to do with this kind of invisible

191
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:54,078
component that is the farmers attention

192
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:55,009
and we have that I mean a culturally

193
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:57,519
we've seen that

194
00:08:55,009 --> 00:09:00,649
over the years you have these same in

195
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,470
livestock you know the eye of the farmer

196
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:06,669
fattens the cow or the shadow of the

197
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:11,350
farmer makes the plants grow and it's

198
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:15,229
those are nods towards something that's

199
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,990
the invisible component and yeah so

200
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:21,710
there's there's that in there that's

201
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:25,250
kind of a deeper philosophical rabbit

202
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:28,070
trail but it is it is important in this

203
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,990
type of agriculture in the communication

204
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,629
of it I would think that just about

205
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,639
anybody who's attracted to either you

206
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:37,009
know just generally probiotic growing or

207
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,689
specifically KNF they've got to have

208
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,730
some of that in their heart though right

209
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,190
because you know generally people who

210
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,250
are you know ruthlessly corporate

211
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:50,690
growers they're growing out of bottles

212
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:53,019
and they are pushing nature to take from

213
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,880
nature to get nature to produce for them

214
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,559
versus all the farmers that I know who

215
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:59,299
are using probiotic growing techniques

216
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,349
are doing it because they're in love

217
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,479
with the plant they're in love with

218
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,580
their land they don't want to have you

219
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,950
know evil run off of their property

220
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,710
going into the streams I would say that

221
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,629
just you know farmers generally what

222
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,400
love in their hearts will find their way

223
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:17,419
to this kind of farming one you know

224
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:20,299
eventually yeah I would say so and and

225
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:23,509
that's not to say it's not this light

226
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:26,779
it's it's not to say it's not about

227
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:29,659
being profitable like it isn't there is

228
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:31,399
they aren't mutually exclusive to have a

229
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:33,649
care for what you're doing or

230
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,129
profitability if you can there's

231
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:40,730
definitely both you know as we toured

232
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:42,799
Korea one of the only things he would

233
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,009
ask master show with ask these farmers

234
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,839
doing that to farming is you know how

235
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:49,730
much money you making you know and

236
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,940
they're obviously caring for what they

237
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,740
do

238
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,280
I mean they have you know whether it's

239
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,110
pigs or crops just beautiful and Macke I

240
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,970
was pretty jealous when I saw persimmon

241
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,129
farm where it's just like they don't

242
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,460
live in fertilize in 11 years and they

243
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:07,669
just have it looks like 23 acres of a

244
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,450
tree that if you know mr. Miyagi had one

245
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:10,639
they

246
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,340
he would have you know it's like 23

247
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,500
acres of perfectly groomed beautifully

248
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:19,580
productive persimmons and they haven't

249
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,100
fertilized in 11 years but he asked them

250
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,740
how much money they make and they're by

251
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,720
and large the answers I heard they're

252
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:31,100
far more profitable than we are in the

253
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,019
US because some some of that has to do

254
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,090
with its family operations where they're

255
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,980
not paying workmen's comp you know

256
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:39,649
they're running these these things with

257
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,019
you know two people my husband and wife

258
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:47,179
and they're killing it on a couple acres

259
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:48,919
and but yeah it's anyways I just wanted

260
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:50,809
to clarify just because we're talking

261
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:54,860
about love doesn't mean it's not viable

262
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:58,959
to make a living on as a person or

263
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,070
family farm it's very much about

264
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,470
sustainability meaning that you don't

265
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,570
have to work a second job to sustain

266
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,920
your farming habit yeah that I think

267
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,660
that's a good thing for you to point out

268
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:12,079
too especially since a you know a great

269
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:13,789
deal of the audience for this show our

270
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,500
commercial cannabis growers right you

271
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:17,569
know we there are people who they want

272
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,980
to you know they're they may have the

273
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,290
heart and the love but at the end of the

274
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,500
day they need to make sure that what

275
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:26,629
they're growing has got high yield is is

276
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,549
developing a fantastic terpene profile

277
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:30,799
and that they're locking down as much

278
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:34,639
bag appeal as they can without going

279
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:37,039
indoors and and you know if people knew

280
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,649
that they they could use this techniques

281
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,750
but they would lose money well they sure

282
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:44,289
as heck wouldn't be as popular but but

283
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,720
you know we know darn well that using

284
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:49,699
probiotic and KNF techniques actually

285
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,590
just makes the plant thrive and then and

286
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,300
then also so your yields are going up

287
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,980
and and so is the quality of your

288
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:58,069
product so alright I think we've

289
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:01,370
probably hit that pretty well so um so

290
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:04,129
you know no-till is also becoming really

291
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,679
popular is would you consider no-till to

292
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:09,049
be an essential part of KNF as well

293
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:13,129
because you don't want to break up the

294
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:18,019
the community in the soil yeah it's

295
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:20,210
definitely in the same line if you're

296
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,600
with natural farming you're not you're

297
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:25,079
not telling

298
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,290
as a general rule if you're if you're

299
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:32,909
coming into a brand new area and it's

300
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:38,399
full of grass or some other you know

301
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:40,649
wild crop or weed you're probably gonna

302
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,559
have to deal with that in that first

303
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,940
season and so that's encouraged that

304
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,758
you're not beating your head against the

305
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,449
wall trying to grow around or through

306
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,190
the grass

307
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:52,679
that's super thick and beating out or

308
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,920
out competing you may need to tail or

309
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:59,328
Spade or do something the first time but

310
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:03,208
yeah that definitely because we're

311
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:05,939
counting on that that network that is

312
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:10,588
established of the fungal Network and

313
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:13,620
all these little organisms part of the

314
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:17,040
soil food web to grow the food so going

315
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,259
in and slam in the mall with equipment

316
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,389
at the end of every season is kind of

317
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,789
counterproductive when I was first

318
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:25,620
starting to read about KNF one of the

319
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:28,620
things that you know one of the one of

320
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,750
the explanations that really hit me was

321
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,310
about soil nutrient cycling and you

322
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,958
actually just hit it talking about that

323
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,609
persimmon farm and so I'm gonna set you

324
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,289
up and I'd like you to just kind of

325
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,149
explain it a little bit because you said

326
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:42,328
that that persimmon farm that you saw

327
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,750
had not fertilized in like 11 years and

328
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:47,938
and that's a perfect example because

329
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,500
normally the the trees get rid of the

330
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:51,240
leaves and and then they're up there

331
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,169
then they are in the soil and then they

332
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,789
rot and so the plant is self-fertilizing

333
00:14:54,169 --> 00:15:02,219
can you go a little more in depth about

334
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:04,860
that yeah there's natural farming I

335
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:09,420
guess the the principle in nutrition is

336
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:12,899
the right amount at the right time means

337
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:16,110
that you can have far less quantity of

338
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:21,208
input than if you're just trying to

339
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:25,019
preload a whole growing cycles food in

340
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:28,229
the beginning so like that persimmon

341
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:31,799
farm I mean they use a lot of composting

342
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:35,399
you know or mulching so they mulch by

343
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:37,289
them but not not a ton of nice

344
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:43,409
they don't need to the rainfall is

345
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:46,669
sufficient yes it with depending on your

346
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:49,469
crop some crops need they really do need

347
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:52,789
nitrogen in their vegetative growth

348
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,910
cycle especially and so there is

349
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:58,740
nutrients available but like we we farm

350
00:15:55,909 --> 00:16:01,649
750 acres of macadamia nuts with natural

351
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,019
farming in Hawaii organically and the

352
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,240
amount of nitrogen we use on our farm

353
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:11,549
now it's all grown with Korean natural

354
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:14,519
farming is homeopathic to put a

355
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:16,709
descriptive word to it compared to the

356
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,740
industry recommended nitrogen amounts

357
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,750
and the experts in our industry look at

358
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,509
in they're like well you'll you'll never

359
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,480
get yields with that amount of nitrogen

360
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:30,120
and now you know five years later

361
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,350
they're like so what are you doing will

362
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,590
you speak at our international

363
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,629
conference you know like because our

364
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,759
yields are increasing year after year

365
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:41,429
we're getting increased yields well our

366
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,230
entire island yields are in decline and

367
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:45,059
they're thinking while the trees are too

368
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,330
old we have the oldest trees on the

369
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:50,279
island on the farm and we're increasing

370
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,670
year after year with this tending to the

371
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:56,100
life of the soil so going back to the

372
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:58,259
person an example so since so since on

373
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,230
this show we are you know the our crew

374
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:04,490
our target crop is cannabis and and

375
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,720
since the persimmon tree you know to its

376
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,359
to its advantage you know the leaves

377
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,009
fall and it's already used the key

378
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,838
components to make the tree and then

379
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:15,750
when the and then in the fall they fall

380
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,069
and so they they then they rot at the

381
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,940
base of the tree and then they go into

382
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,529
the soil and so it's kind of self self

383
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,049
fertilizing since that's not the case

384
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:29,480
with cannabis plants essentially what

385
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:32,909
we're trying to do is to feed the

386
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,880
microorganisms that are in the soil and

387
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:38,460
kind of replace what would happen if we

388
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,250
just let the cannabis plants go through

389
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,650
their season and then degrade and die

390
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,230
you know after they seed the soil below

391
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,610
them so that they're ready to go in the

392
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,769
spring

393
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:53,659
again right so we're just trying to help

394
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:55,339
replace the nature since we are we pull

395
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,798
the plants out and we don't let them die

396
00:17:55,339 --> 00:18:00,109
right there

397
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:03,410
yeah and you're going for maximum yields

398
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:05,449
in your your square footage so you're

399
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,820
you're trying to replace nature but

400
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:14,150
you're also I mean with like we use

401
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:17,689
specific sprays or or liquid nutrients

402
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,880
at each stage of say a cannabis plant so

403
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,120
cannabis plant loves about a thirty to

404
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,549
one

405
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,949
fungal the bacterial ratio so you're IMO

406
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:28,369
or you're tending of the microbial life

407
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,710
and your soil is going to be the huge

408
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:34,099
component to have healthy disease

409
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:37,179
resistant pest resistance even if

410
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:40,629
they're healthy and have good biology

411
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:44,210
microbiology going on in the soil and

412
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:48,250
but then there is because we're kind of

413
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:51,950
intensively farming there is the need to

414
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,829
apply nutrients your to get you know to

415
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,808
maximize yields in your space so

416
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:58,639
bringing in like a fish amino acid a

417
00:18:56,808 --> 00:19:01,730
nitrogen source at the right time and

418
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,980
the right amount there's a big deal and

419
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,480
and that's not like ground upon and

420
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:12,610
natural farming it is it is about

421
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,610
maximizing yields but it's also

422
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,720
recognizing that the there's a cost to

423
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,270
fertilizer that affects your bottom line

424
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,519
and as a cannabis industry like in in

425
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:25,539
California they're kind of going through

426
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,429
a paradigm shift as they look look at

427
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:31,668
okay I'm not gonna get you know twenty

428
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:34,450
five hundred a pound anymore I got a I

429
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:37,480
gotta figure out a new normal which is

430
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:42,019
definitely sub but sub a thousand and

431
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:44,599
and find out what my bottom line is now

432
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:46,609
and it might mean that they have to look

433
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:50,389
at what they're paying for fertilizers

434
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:54,259
and and inputs and labor and and all

435
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:57,070
this stuff and and there's there's hope

436
00:19:54,259 --> 00:20:00,049
you know this this doesn't have to be

437
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:05,389
breaking the bank to make highly

438
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:07,039
productive beautiful plan right on so

439
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,509
for those of you who are listening and

440
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,740
you're just like dying for us to get to

441
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:11,690
the techniques and you're less

442
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,220
interested in the in the background that

443
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,570
we're doing why make sure you stay to

444
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,339
the second set where we're gonna be

445
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:18,200
we're gonna be talking about the the

446
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,609
various amendments but for now we're

447
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,440
gonna take our first short break and be

448
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:23,389
right back you're listening to shaping

449
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,259
fire and my guest today is Korean

450
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,580
natural farming educator Chris Trump

451
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,950
using pesticides when growing cannabis

452
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:33,319
has been common for a long time nowadays

453
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,509
though we know better we know that most

454
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,039
pesticides formulated for food crops

455
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,440
have never been tested for use with

456
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,930
cannabis they've been tested to be eaten

457
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,700
in tiny doses they have not been tested

458
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,820
to be inhaled and especially not

459
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,200
concentrated into a cannabis oil

460
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,939
chemical residues from pesticides are

461
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,460
not healthy for anyone but they are

462
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,080
especially dangerous for patients for

463
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,390
commercial cannabis growers this has

464
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,129
become very impactful cannabis

465
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,800
enthusiasts and patients have gotten

466
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,740
educated enough that they avoid growers

467
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,359
who used pesticides not only that but

468
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,670
states across the country have begun

469
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:11,240
making pesticide testing mandatory on

470
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:12,740
all licensed cannabis crops the time has

471
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,839
come to find a better way to fight

472
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,730
garden pests than covering your cannabis

473
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:20,859
and chemicals and there is a better way

474
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,210
let some good bugs fight your bad bugs

475
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:25,009
beneficial insects and predatory mites

476
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,259
have come a long way since we were

477
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:29,240
buying ladybugs online and putting them

478
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:32,720
in the grow room and just hoping for the

479
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,120
best natural enemies biocontrol

00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,730
shaping fire you already understand the

500
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:30,069
importance of living soil when growing

501
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,140
cannabis when you have active microbe

502
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:34,179
communities in your substrate you go way

503
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,880
beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen

504
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,500
phosphorus and potassium having active

505
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,390
microorganisms in your substrate

506
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,369
supports vigorous plant growth

507
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,640
throughout the plants root zone making

508
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:47,319
for higher yields and thriving flowers

509
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,870
mammoth pea is the first organically

510
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,279
derived microbial inoculant that focuses

511
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,919
on your plants nutrient cycling

512
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,660
processes to release soil phosphorus and

513
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,029
other micronutrients from they're bound

514
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,550
forms making them more available to the

515
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:02,230
plant increased levels of phosphorus

516
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,059
will also keep internode shorter and

517
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,220
focus your plants energy on bud

518
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:08,289
production not only that but the

519
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,309
microbes act as a defense shield for the

520
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:11,349
plants rhizosphere

521
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:13,869
by out competing potentially harmful

522
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:15,759
pathogenic microbes pretty cool right

523
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:17,889
mammoth pee not only unlocks the

524
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,799
nutrients in your soil but it also helps

525
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:23,320
protect your plant from disease mammoths

526
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,049
peas beneficial bacteria act like micro

527
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:28,960
bioreactors continually producing

528
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:30,789
enzymes that release nutrients mammoths

529
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,009
pea was developed at a u.s. university

530
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:34,750
has been extensively tested by colorado

531
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:37,299
growers and independent laboratories

532
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:40,029
mammoth pea is proven to increase growth

533
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,200
and enhance blooming one of the great

534
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:42,910
things about supplementing with

535
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,769
microorganisms is that they won't

536
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,110
compete with whatever fertilizer program

537
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:48,940
you're already running simply dose on

538
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:51,250
top of your fertilizer schedule for

539
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,870
increased benefits to learn more and to

540
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,940
find out where you can buy mammoth pee

541
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:56,939
near you check out their website at

542
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:32,680
that is throughout the literature is

543
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:35,079
this this bsj brown sugar

544
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,450
jaggery so so let's go ahead and talk a

545
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:41,049
little bit about that first before we

546
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,430
get into the different the different

547
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:45,000
things we're gonna do or do about it

548
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:50,710
what is this brown sugar jaggery

549
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:54,009
yeah it's um it's funny because as we as

550
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:58,860
we first were learning this as this kind

551
00:24:54,009 --> 00:25:02,410
of first landed in Hawaii from Korea

552
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:05,729
there was a significant learning curve

553
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:10,480
not just from learning a new method but

554
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,610
just translation journey where not only

555
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,470
are we translating from Korean the

556
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:20,889
English we're translating from Korean

557
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:25,150
culture idioms and and indigenous plants

558
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:27,160
and products to English and American

559
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,750
mindset so that was that was a huge

560
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:35,130
process for and everybody involved so if

561
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:37,779
it if something hopefully that in the

562
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,780
education going forward people don't

563
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:42,970
have to go through that that painstaking

564
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:45,940
journey that we went through in the

565
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:49,380
beginning then they can learn from the

566
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:53,860
years of experience we've had since then

567
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:55,060
but brown sugar is used in Korean

568
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:58,750
natural farming on a lot of the

569
00:25:55,059 --> 00:26:04,089
fermentation processes with fruits and

570
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:07,619
plants and was a vital component salt is

571
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:11,829
used but brown sugar and jaggery its

572
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:14,619
that was one thing in here in America

573
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:17,740
you go to Costco and you buy brown sugar

574
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:20,559
and really that's processed sugar with

575
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,230
some molasses added back in to make it

576
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,730
brown so it's white sugar and then they

577
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:28,240
browned it

578
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:32,769
with adding the molasses back in and so

579
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,809
when this when it was first communicated

580
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:38,079
whether we're talking about it's just

581
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,869
kind of the cheap unprocessed sugar you

582
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,609
can get in Korea or

583
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:45,759
these other Asian countries which is

584
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:48,519
just kind of lightly processed cane

585
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,430
sugar so it still has you know kind of

586
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,650
the natural molasses in it and so that

587
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:56,289
stuff kind of mainly what that's talking

588
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,840
about but if you can just get bound

589
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:01,389
sugar from Costco that works or if you

590
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,889
get some unprocessed sugar there's a

591
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,410
bunch of different types that are

592
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,330
available in the US where it's just kind

593
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,880
of you know sugar in the raw you don't

594
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:13,480
want to buy that they got a brand name

595
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,270
on that it's a really expensive but it's

596
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,980
it's the same concept it's just

597
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:19,808
unprocessed cane sugar or less punch

598
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,819
right on Ryan that makes a lot of sense

599
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:24,940
but the word jaggery it sounds so exotic

600
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:26,859
right yeah unprocessed sugar doesn't

601
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,299
doesn't have the same spin to it but but

602
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:30,428
at least at least you know it's the same

603
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:32,079
thing so all right so let's start at the

604
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:35,290
top of the list with these amendments um

605
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:37,569
I put them in an order of what Dilys to

606
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:39,339
me anyway seems like it's increasing

607
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:42,189
complexity and I've only made it through

608
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:43,629
the first few but my goal here is that

609
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,850
we can we can start with something that

610
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,620
sounds simple so that folks who are

611
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:49,869
listening or like oh you know I can do

612
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:51,579
that and then and then as we go through

613
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:54,699
this long second set they'll get

614
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:56,529
increasingly more complex like like

615
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,650
we'll probably lose some people at fish

616
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:02,139
immuno acids for example so so let's

617
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:05,730
start with maltose Oh soso break down

618
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:12,250
how people would use maltose and and why

619
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:15,849
yeah maltose is something used in Korean

620
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:21,190
fermentation in a bunch of different

621
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:26,230
ways and in the US that kind of

622
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:33,400
translates into are some of the things

623
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:37,808
we use for beer production maltose for

624
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:43,900
us as American farmers is super helpful

625
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:46,720
and not absolutely necessary so um it as

626
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:51,009
we looked at kind of translating these

627
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,990
concepts from Korean culture where some

628
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:54,619
things are super readily available and

629
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,000
everybody knows how to do

630
00:28:54,619 --> 00:29:02,449
to us culture and what we have available

631
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,410
a lot of some of the maltose juice got

632
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:09,470
dropped in place of just getting

633
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:15,769
inexpensive beer rather than making your

634
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:19,940
own rice beer or rice wine which maltose

635
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:22,190
is used for so so it's interesting

636
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,230
because like you know when I first got

637
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:27,170
started I'm like alright you you you

638
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,730
sprout the barley and then and then you

639
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,789
you you crushed it and then you you

640
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:34,279
remove the foam from the top and I

641
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:36,558
continued to look for something that I

642
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,899
would then put that in no I didn't know

643
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:42,529
any better and I I just I just added it

644
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,090
to my my water that I was using to you

645
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:46,490
know my rent rain water that I was using

646
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:48,439
for the plants but are you saying that

647
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,380
that folks are not really using this as

648
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,200
much anymore because there are other KNF

649
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,330
techniques that you know cover that same

650
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,740
ground are you saying that people just

651
00:29:56,329 --> 00:30:03,799
don't bother making it themselves

652
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:06,950
anymore yeah it's um so if you wanted to

653
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:10,490
make your own brown rice vinegar you

654
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:15,440
could go through this elaborate process

655
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:17,210
to make the brown rice vinegar and and

656
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:24,529
maltose is involved if you wanted to

657
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:26,840
make maca Lee which is Korean rice beer

658
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:29,089
which is really tasty and I highly

659
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:31,909
recommend going on that journey if that

660
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:35,509
interests you but yeah we've actually

661
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:39,590
just that's kind of been edited out of

662
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:43,009
the the journey for kind of an American

663
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:46,308
natural farmer for the most part it's

664
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:48,410
still cool and it still has a role if

665
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:50,808
you wanted to make it but you can do

666
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,920
natural farming without ever creating

667
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:53,329
your own maltose

668
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,009
yeah and it's something that I only

669
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:56,389
bothered to do once because as soon as I

670
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:58,789
got turned on to the second one we're

671
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:01,100
gonna talk about you know making lactic

672
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:03,109
acid bacteria from our rice water wash

673
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:06,199
that seemed to be the first one that

674
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:08,079
really hit and caused my plants to jump

675
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,120
so so would you explain

676
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,158
rice water wash and and how to ferment

677
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:18,268
it and why this matters to cannabis

678
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:22,740
plants yeah so a lot of what you can buy

679
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:26,409
in the store somebody's making you a

680
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:32,769
microbe amendment a lot of it is based

681
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:35,970
in the lactobacilli family of bacteria

682
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:40,960
which spans a bunch of little

683
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:44,019
subcategories and the idea in korean

684
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,970
natural farming la be lactic acid

685
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:56,649
bacteria is that you can culture it from

686
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:59,589
your area from the air and and make it

687
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:03,058
yourself in a really effective and

688
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:07,689
simple method and then have freshly

689
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:10,778
brewed kind of highly active lactic acid

690
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:14,230
bacteria from your environment to apply

691
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:17,308
on your farm and it's not super

692
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:21,909
expensive though milk isn't super cheap

693
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:24,278
it's it's pretty doable and accessible

694
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:27,429
for farmers and I think a lot of a lot

695
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:30,909
of the kind of probiotic cannabis

696
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:32,830
farmers probably started with the LAV so

697
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:35,470
when you go ahead and for the people who

698
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:36,730
have who have never created this I mean

699
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,159
it's not very complex would you walk

700
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,589
them through walk us all through a

701
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:43,090
recipe that they can kind of wrap their

702
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:44,648
heads around I mean obviously if

703
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:46,509
somebody really wants to get into this

704
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:49,209
stuff they're gonna follow up on the

705
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:51,490
episode that we're you know doing today

706
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,019
with some with some googling and you

707
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,000
know check you know to get something

708
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:56,349
that's line by line but but so people

709
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,349
can get their heads wrapped around it

710
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:03,908
would you explain how one would do it

711
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:06,099
sure yeah so um it's funny because I

712
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:11,019
grew up in Hawaii I was born raised in

713
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:14,589
Hawaii and the everybody knows to make

714
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:17,919
rice in Hawaii is it's just culture and

715
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:21,459
and coming to you know being involved in

716
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:25,270
mainland us some people like okay what

717
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:27,278
- its rice and so in the normal often

718
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:31,179
when you make rice you'll give it a

719
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:33,640
rinse first it's it's just kind of to

720
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:36,610
take some of the extra kind of dust off

721
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,370
your rice it not everybody does it that

722
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:41,139
way but but it makes it more you know it

723
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:47,500
makes it it makes it a little less Nikki

724
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:49,270
yeah so for this la be recipe you you

725
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,148
take your rice as if you were gonna make

726
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:55,139
yourself a pot of rice and you just fill

727
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:58,449
fill up some water in your dry right and

728
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,259
rinse it around and the rice the water

729
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:05,288
will become kind of milky and white and

730
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:08,858
you pour that off into a clean container

731
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:12,579
now one place people always are often

732
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:15,279
fail in this process is by having a

733
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:17,949
little soap scum left in the container

734
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,080
they just washed out for this so if you

735
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:24,398
have soap left in that jar where you

736
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:27,519
pour your rice wash water it won't go

737
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:31,388
properly it won't actually produce the

738
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:34,418
the bacterias will be inhibited by the

739
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,919
soap remaining in that jar so just make

740
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:42,009
sure real thorough rinse

741
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:45,398
protip there by go ahead and and take

742
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:49,119
that rice wash water set it on in a in a

743
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:53,079
cool and hopefully not direct sunlight

744
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:56,320
spot with a breathable lid like a piece

745
00:34:53,079 --> 00:35:00,219
of paper towel or paper napkin

746
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,849
and let that sit for about anywhere from

747
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:05,259
one to three days generally it depending

748
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:07,930
on your temperature if it's really warm

749
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:13,150
where you are this might only take a day

750
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:18,969
if it's cooler you know in the fifties

751
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:21,700
it could take up to five days if you can

752
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:21,969
put it outside without it getting messed

753
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:24,069
with

754
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:26,409
that'd be great so if you have it under

755
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,300
a tree and protected from the rain and

756
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:31,588
the winds able to blow over it you're

757
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:35,030
gonna get all this all the good biology

758
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:38,139
micro microbes floating in there blows

759
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:41,960
the breeze that can jump in there but um

760
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:44,449
generally a lot of what's gonna be in

761
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,630
there is just you know what was in the

762
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:50,149
air when it got poured in and on your

763
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:55,130
hands even which you know use clean

764
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:58,730
hands when you make this and after about

765
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:01,970
two or three days it will change its

766
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:04,670
smell and this is ever-so-slight it's a

767
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:07,069
very slight alteration and smell so you

768
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,809
want to be smelling it regularly and all

769
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:13,760
of a sudden it'll have just a slightest

770
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:16,820
sweet smell to put a taste to a smell

771
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,450
but it's um it's just a little bit of a

772
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:23,240
hint of fermentation just just the

773
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:27,079
slightest change so if you sense just a

774
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:32,239
tiny change it's probably ready if it

775
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:34,659
smells at all rotten or super sour it

776
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,969
went too long you missed that sweet spot

777
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:43,069
and then you take that rice wash water

778
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:45,969
and you add it in a jar at a rate of one

779
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:51,950
part rice wash water to ten parts milk

780
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:54,949
if you can get whole milk that's great

781
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:57,769
and it can be stored by it doesn't have

782
00:36:54,949 --> 00:37:02,109
to be organic it's if you if you're

783
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:05,239
gonna drink it yourself you know as a

784
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:07,730
you know health thing then you probably

785
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:09,500
go for the milk that you would want to

786
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,869
drink but if you're feeding if you're

787
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,179
putting it on soil I would just

788
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:18,619
encourage you to not spend a ton of

789
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:22,039
money on this and yeah add it one part

790
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:26,389
rice wash water to ten parts milk put it

791
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:29,719
in a cool and place out of direct

792
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:31,789
sunlight with a breathable lid again

793
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:36,799
like a paper towel you need a rubber

794
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:40,820
band put it around the lid and you leave

795
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:46,900
that and should be around five days two

796
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:48,690
to five days and you'll have a

797
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,019
separating of the

798
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:56,909
curds in the way just like Miss Muffet

799
00:37:52,019 --> 00:38:00,420
ate when she sat on her tuffet and yeah

800
00:37:56,909 --> 00:38:05,578
it's so the yellow serum or the clear

801
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:08,099
serum that forms in the jar is your whey

802
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:10,380
proteins and that's where all your LAV

803
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:14,010
activity is going to be and then the

804
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,230
curds is your casein protein so the two

805
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,650
proteins in milk will separate we do two

806
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:22,050
fermentation you you extract your curds

807
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,550
or strain them out you can let some of

808
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,579
the way I like to use something that's

809
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:29,460
fine as a t-shirt cloth if you use

810
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:32,849
something too thick like a strainer or

811
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:36,630
to pull like a strainer you're gonna get

812
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:41,130
a lot of cloudiness from the curds going

813
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:42,869
staying in your L AP serum and really

814
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,539
you want it to be clear so I like to use

815
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:47,220
something like a t-shirt and then yeah

816
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,039
you pull off your curds you can make

817
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:51,779
cheese with that or just eat them mix

818
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:53,909
them with some something and eat them

819
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,609
you can feed them to your livestock your

820
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:59,460
animals they'll love them and it's great

821
00:38:56,608 --> 00:39:01,380
form and then that that liquid that

822
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,970
clear liquid that you have left you can

823
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,210
store in your fridge with a breathable

824
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:08,639
lid but that you can use on your plants

825
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:12,349
at a rate of one to a thousand so one

826
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:15,629
part lab2 a thousand parts water and

827
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:17,910
it's excellent for all kinds of things

828
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,160
there's a ton of applications of that

829
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:22,769
and the natural farming toolkit but

830
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,809
that's the the basic and as far as

831
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:26,550
adding it to your cannabis plants goes

832
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:28,078
there's a you know there's a lot of

833
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,060
different ways that you can use it but

834
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,980
that I would say that you know people

835
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:35,250
should know that they could both pour it

836
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,960
into their soil directly but it also

837
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,170
where it's really great as a foliar

838
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,510
right yeah yeah so it's at the rate of

839
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:47,490
one to a thousand it's really safe it's

840
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:52,760
not gonna cause shock or or you know any

841
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:54,929
any kind of over concentration issues

842
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,089
one of the things that I was curious

843
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:59,460
about is is they you know once you've

844
00:39:57,088 --> 00:40:02,150
gotten to this point and it's in your

845
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,970
fridge and your ratio is one to a

846
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:08,298
and you know chances are that the the

847
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:11,179
LAV that you have made its gonna last

848
00:40:08,298 --> 00:40:13,429
for a while but but I don't really know

849
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:16,909
how long and if there's a way that you

850
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:19,429
can extend the life of it so you're not

851
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:22,670
having to make it you know every couple

852
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:25,759
weeks what's your experience you know I

853
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:29,510
feel like in a fridge with a breathable

854
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,240
lid you have vitality for anywhere from

855
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:35,270
one to two months so don't feel like

856
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,689
about that you got to use it within the

857
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:41,150
week it's still real viable within a

858
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:44,119
couple months I wouldn't go beyond a

859
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,220
couple months I think that third month

860
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,068
that you're probably losing some of the

861
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:51,919
vitality you had initially but at that

862
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:54,230
temperature and a refrigerator it's

863
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,980
really everything's gonna slow down and

864
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:02,750
kind of just go to sleep or calm down a

865
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:05,960
lot of their processes and yeah so you

866
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:09,380
you're really gonna get a great storage

867
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:13,338
and a fridge if you have a store without

868
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:17,960
refrigeration you could mix it equal

869
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:21,318
mass with brown sugar so you can measure

870
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,380
that by weight or generally volume you

871
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:26,960
really want to put a ton of brown sugar

872
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:31,670
in so it's all the water is kind of tied

873
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,440
up in that and you can store that at

874
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:37,298
stores last I would say a month would be

875
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,889
the max on a non refrigerated kind of

876
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:41,989
ground sugar storage it's not

877
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:46,219
recommended to store with molasses some

878
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:49,278
people do that that's um that's not

879
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:52,699
really recommended in Korea natural

880
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:53,358
farming but you got to do what you can

881
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:59,389
with what you got

882
00:41:53,358 --> 00:42:01,250
Yeah right yeah all right on so so so

883
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:03,650
let's move on to our next amendments

884
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,269
because rice water wash is great and you

885
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,630
know for people who are new to this it

886
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:11,420
is a you know I I can speak for myself

887
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,190
it is a it is a good confidence builder

888
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,608
right when you do that when you do that

889
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,470
as simple as it is

890
00:42:14,608 --> 00:42:18,420
and and it goes right you're like all

891
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:20,038
right I'm ready to go what's next and

892
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,499
for me the next one that we're going to

893
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,980
talk about fermented fruit juice also

894
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:27,899
all over the internet as ffj this was

895
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,998
the first thing that I came across then

896
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,400
I'm like alright this is different what

897
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:34,108
is this and I and then I heard the term

898
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,630
Korean natural farming for the first

899
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:38,759
time so similar to like what we just did

900
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,519
with the rice water wash would you

901
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:43,980
explain fermented fruit juice and and

902
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:47,659
and then how how you choose your fruits

903
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:50,969
in and then how you do your ferment yeah

904
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:54,659
let me touch on if it's alright with you

905
00:42:50,969 --> 00:43:00,139
Chango the some of the misconceptions

906
00:42:54,659 --> 00:43:03,239
I've seen on the internet regarding ffj

907
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:09,778
so ffj is used in natural farming and

908
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:13,139
fairly limited kind of amount so we use

909
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:19,650
it for ripening promotion in fruit and a

910
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:22,469
few other inputs but in in the canvas

911
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:30,269
world that seemed to have been adopted

912
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:33,808
as a thing for fruits meaning bud

913
00:43:30,268 --> 00:43:37,379
production and I think that that's a

914
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:41,130
little bit of a mistranslation of the of

915
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:43,289
the concepts in natural farming in it's

916
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,568
it's not so much intended for that

917
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:49,140
purpose believe it or not spj is

918
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:51,210
actually what you want for that and when

919
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:53,788
we can get into that next time I'm sure

920
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,400
fermented plant juice so fermented fruit

921
00:43:53,789 --> 00:44:00,900
juice and then the second kind of

922
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,329
misnomer I've seen in just some of the

923
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,999
information on the internet is that you

924
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:09,839
just want to buy the best things you can

925
00:44:05,998 --> 00:44:11,518
from the store to make your ffj with and

926
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,389
that all these tropical fruits were

927
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:18,988
using in Hawaii or these things are the

928
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:20,909
best when I can that's not really the

929
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:23,849
case what you want to get if you're

930
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:26,159
doing ffj is you want to find the things

931
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:26,940
that you can find wild in your

932
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,379
environment

933
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,179
so if

934
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,588
there goes on back to what you started

935
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:32,940
with right that you want to use the

936
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:35,130
microbes that you find in your

937
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,250
neighborhood so that they live where you

938
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:41,750
grow yeah there's there's some there's

939
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:46,259
some real benefit to getting the

940
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:48,150
beneficial bio chemicals that are in the

941
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:51,599
plants that thrive in your environment

942
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,849
and the plant growth hormones that are

943
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,150
fresh they're not something that was

944
00:44:53,849 --> 00:45:00,599
picked green got ripe in the truck

945
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:03,869
coming across the world and has been

946
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:10,048
sitting and kind of calming down in all

947
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:12,660
its really vibrancy for weeks and before

948
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:15,778
it even gets to ferment in your

949
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:19,710
fermentation vessel and then it has none

950
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:21,449
of it yeasts and bacteria on its surface

951
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,608
that helped it grow because I was all

952
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:26,759
bleach washed off and so people get

953
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:28,409
these really funky green mold and stuff

954
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:31,769
forming on the top and that's mostly

955
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:33,690
because none of that by a Mike

956
00:45:31,768 --> 00:45:36,328
none of those microbes that worked with

957
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,880
that plants for it to grow in in the

958
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:40,740
symbiotic way were present when they

959
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,130
began their fermentation so they're just

960
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:46,889
getting whatever was on their hands or

961
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:50,220
in their jar or which isn't really

962
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:52,139
sufficient or proper for this type of

963
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:53,939
fermentation that we're trying to

964
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:57,989
accomplish we really want a plan to

965
00:45:53,940 --> 00:46:02,369
permit in its own microbiology where

966
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:06,209
microorganisms yeah so that's that's a

967
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:10,160
misnomer so ffj is a combination of

968
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:13,920
three ripe fruits so this could be

969
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:16,108
strawberries it could be it could be

970
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:21,269
even like things we don't normally eat

971
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:23,308
like oh man I can't think of off the top

972
00:46:21,268 --> 00:46:24,989
of my head Pacific Northwest but it's

973
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:27,000
like rose hips if you're thinking about

974
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:30,568
north yeah Road hips are great yeah I

975
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:35,909
see all kinds of those yeah all rose

976
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:40,079
hips squash you know yeah there's

977
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:41,589
there's all kinds of anything that you

978
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,769
can think of that

979
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:48,039
to a ripe fruit even if it's wild and

980
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:50,739
kind of not really a normal thing you

981
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:53,920
would eat but say the birds eat it those

982
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:57,489
are all your your ripe fruits and so you

983
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,650
could harvest those with ssj you can use

984
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:01,329
up to three fruits and it's actually

985
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,250
recommended to use three varieties of

986
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:09,069
fruit so it's more anything like smile

987
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:11,590
biologically yeah and also just ripe

988
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:15,940
fruits have kind of they've they

989
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:19,450
processed to a different kind of profile

990
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:21,519
in in kind of what's going on in bio

991
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:24,460
chemicals and plant growth hormone and

992
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:27,150
all that stuff which is a you know is

993
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:29,349
it's not it's a part of it we don't

994
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:33,119
science is working hard to understand

995
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:35,860
all this going on there but um yeah so

996
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,839
three three different fruits you mix it

997
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:41,230
with equal weights brown sugar so if you

998
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:43,170
have five pounds of a variety of fruit

999
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:46,800
you get five pounds of brown sugar

1000
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:49,539
generally if your fruits really dry

1001
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,250
maybe your rose hips have almost no

1002
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:54,670
moisture in it you could start with less

1003
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:57,699
sugar four but generally the rule is one

1004
00:47:54,670 --> 00:48:00,639
to one sugar by weight you massage it

1005
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:04,779
together break up your fruits chop it up

1006
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:08,469
whatever so you kind of mash it you put

1007
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:10,360
it in a jar this this mash that you've

1008
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:14,230
just done you put it in the jar to

1009
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:16,630
ferment for about five to seven days and

1010
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:20,619
it'll separate you'll have liquid and

1011
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:23,170
solids and it's really undergoes a cool

1012
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:27,940
fermentation process that amount of

1013
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:31,210
sugar is so that it doesn't run away now

1014
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:34,450
when you go to store it so you strain it

1015
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:36,909
off your solids can be strained out so

1016
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:40,419
you just have your liquid left if you

1017
00:48:36,909 --> 00:48:42,969
use the less sugar then one to one or if

1018
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:46,210
it seems like it's still really active

1019
00:48:42,969 --> 00:48:52,480
when storing you can add sugar you want

1020
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:54,309
to kind of maximize the the sugar so

1021
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,880
that all the water molecules are kind of

1022
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,920
tied

1023
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,960
and it stops fermenting because if you

1024
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,690
have too much water it'll keep going

1025
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,000
into alcohol and we don't want it to

1026
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,940
become a strong alcohol we want it to

1027
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,769
kind of stay in that minor fermentation

1028
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:13,269
that it did just in that five to seven

1029
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:15,489
days and then that you can store with a

1030
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:17,349
breathable lid at room temperature and

1031
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:22,229
that keeps for a long time that can keep

1032
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:25,389
for six months really and be viable and

1033
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:28,179
you use that on your farm at a rate of

1034
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:30,190
one to five hundred when you're when

1035
00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:33,129
you're brewing up your fermented fruit

1036
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,170
juice you're using a permeable top on

1037
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,880
that well just like the rest of these

1038
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,250
right like the cheesecloth or something

1039
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,760
because you're you you both want to have

1040
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:46,000
the air exchange and you want to invite

1041
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:51,430
air bound you know yeasts and things

1042
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,670
right yeah yeah and with sfj and fpj we

1043
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:58,089
expect that we have a lot of our

1044
00:49:53,670 --> 00:50:00,519
microbes already in there but yeah we

1045
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:04,900
want that that breathability that that

1046
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:07,030
gas exchange that'll happen and because

1047
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,170
the microbes will be using oxygen and

1048
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:13,750
just like they they breathe you know one

1049
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:15,400
of the things uh you know the first time

1050
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:18,070
I tried to make this I used soar bot

1051
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,829
stuff and you're right when when fruits

1052
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:22,480
travel I mean I papaya cuz that's what

1053
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:25,329
the literature was saying right but the

1054
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,190
papaya has traveled a really long way

1055
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:29,380
and in a lot of ways they try to

1056
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,119
sterilize it as much as they can for

1057
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,369
travel because they don't want it to rot

1058
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,039
along the way so you're getting a

1059
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:37,900
version of the fruit definitely not what

1060
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:41,050
the locals where it was grown were

1061
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,849
eating and a local friend of mine said

1062
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:45,220
you know I explained to him my issue and

1063
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:48,429
why my first ffj didn't work and he says

1064
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:50,230
just go glean off the trees you know

1065
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:52,239
whatever whatever's near your house

1066
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,699
because it's it's not like you are

1067
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,579
you're making this to eat and so you

1068
00:50:54,699 --> 00:51:00,429
necessarily need it to be palatable all

1069
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:03,699
you need are the essential ingredients

1070
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:05,230
of the fruit so so if you you know if

1071
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:07,599
you or your neighbors got an old you

1072
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,409
know plum tree and you know just just go

1073
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,630
glean off

1074
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:12,819
and especially if it's moving from ripe

1075
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:15,250
to overripe so long as it hasn't started

1076
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,140
producing alcohol man there's so much

1077
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:20,500
biological activity in that thing it's

1078
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:23,619
gonna make a great ffj yep yeah

1079
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,909
that's ideal right on right on so so

1080
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:27,880
we're seeing that we want to you know

1081
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:29,649
the brewing part is easy and to get some

1082
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,050
local fruits that are that are you know

1083
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:34,389
we've got all of the the life stuff on

1084
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:39,220
the outside of it and then and then make

1085
00:51:34,389 --> 00:51:40,690
sure that we add enough sugar and then I

1086
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:43,029
was actually I'm actually surprised that

1087
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:45,190
it lasts as long as it is just at room

1088
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:47,950
temperature I actually went through mine

1089
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:49,510
really fast because I figured that fruit

1090
00:51:47,949 --> 00:51:51,699
you know I always think of fruit being

1091
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:54,640
unstable and it's going to go to alcohol

1092
00:51:51,699 --> 00:51:56,289
quickly but but it seems like if you if

1093
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,750
you put enough sugar in you're gonna

1094
00:51:56,289 --> 00:52:02,050
slow it down and then at room

1095
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:04,690
temperature like not on top of the

1096
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:08,380
fridge like kombucha it'll it'll help it

1097
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:11,079
sleep even more right yeah and and the

1098
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:13,539
the thing that's actually causing it to

1099
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:18,190
be shelf-stable is the amount of sugar

1100
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:20,019
so if you added you know two parts water

1101
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,849
to that so if you just dumped in a bunch

1102
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:25,509
of water that would go off like crazy

1103
00:52:21,849 --> 00:52:31,000
and go from alcohol of the vinegar so

1104
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:34,810
it's the the sugar is dry it actually

1105
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,480
creates bonds with the water molecules

1106
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:40,210
and the microbes that do fermentation

1107
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,490
need water do any of their process so

1108
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:45,699
bike this is the specific balance of

1109
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:48,519
sugar or by total saturation of sugar

1110
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:51,039
you've actually trapped all your your

1111
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:54,880
water molecules in in chemical bonds

1112
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:56,829
with sugar and and there's not a whole

1113
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,809
lot of water available so you've created

1114
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:01,000
kind of a desert environment for your

1115
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:03,239
microbes so they all are just kind of

1116
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,030
hanging around waiting for you to

1117
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:10,389
reintroduce water which you do when you

1118
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:12,700
add FPGA or ffj at a rate of 1 to 500

1119
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:15,069
that makes so much more sense to me so

1120
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:17,309
so even though the essential ingredients

1121
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:20,980
are there for to continue on alcohol

1122
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:22,329
because the sugar is out of balance with

1123
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,829
the water the

1124
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:26,289
microbes don't have the magic

1125
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:28,719
combination to continue their party on

1126
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:32,139
alcohol so they just hang out until you

1127
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:34,809
add them to water and then you do you

1128
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:36,460
know foliar or just add it to your sip

1129
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:37,119
or whatever your whatever you're gonna

1130
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:44,170
do with it

1131
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:46,150
yep yeah and they they there are minor

1132
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:48,670
alcohol is produced in that initial

1133
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:51,010
fermentation so there is a little bit

1134
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:52,269
but yeah that can't continue and use all

1135
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:55,750
that sugar because they don't have the

1136
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:58,090
water they do so the next one we're

1137
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:01,239
gonna talk about fermented plant juice

1138
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:04,809
this one is nice because you can you

1139
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:06,489
know you can wildcraft you know the

1140
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:09,489
plants that you want to use pretty much

1141
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:11,709
year-round whereas you know if you're if

1142
00:54:09,489 --> 00:54:13,989
you're gonna glean you either need to do

1143
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:15,760
it during fruit season or you need to

1144
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:18,159
get a little more creative like with

1145
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,870
rose hips or something so so why don't

1146
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:23,829
we do the same process with fermented

1147
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:28,359
plant juice please yeah fermented plant

1148
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:30,549
juice is really similar to fermented

1149
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:35,530
fruit juice except you don't use

1150
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:38,289
multiple plants in one brew if I'm going

1151
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:42,040
to use my FD J's and I want to use my

1152
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:45,130
rhubarb spj at the same time I use my

1153
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:49,239
dandelion fpj then I can just add you

1154
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:52,750
know a half of each to make one to 500

1155
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:54,969
and use it at that time but for storage

1156
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:57,929
they stay separate and for the initial

1157
00:54:54,969 --> 00:55:01,779
brew process they stay separate so

1158
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:04,659
that's that's specifically for for some

1159
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:07,120
of the you know one might have a much

1160
00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:09,519
more delicate yeast and bacterial makeup

1161
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,889
all over it that it's gonna do its

1162
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:14,019
fermentation and and process it then

1163
00:55:11,889 --> 00:55:17,769
another one and I combined them for

1164
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:19,630
fermentation you're gonna have you know

1165
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:21,610
the dominant one or the stronger one

1166
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:24,730
would take over and and you'd never even

1167
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:29,289
have a representation or very small of

1168
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:30,639
the you know the less dominant so yeah

1169
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:33,400
you really you want to make these

1170
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:35,589
separately and store them separately but

1171
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,950
yeah with fpj you can use all kinds of

1172
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:39,309
stuff

1173
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:41,588
I used rhubarb here in Idaho last year

1174
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:45,010
it was incredible there was tons of it

1175
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:47,828
it was easy it tasted amazing and if I

1176
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:51,880
wanted to you know bring in a new person

1177
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:54,670
and make him taste our fertilizer you

1178
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,588
know they were kind of floored by being

1179
00:55:54,670 --> 00:56:00,430
able to drink this incredibly tasting

1180
00:55:56,588 --> 00:56:04,179
that you know ferment we're using on

1181
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:07,268
plants and so that was fun but you can

1182
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:09,548
use anything so much is available and

1183
00:56:07,268 --> 00:56:13,028
what you're identifying as you look for

1184
00:56:09,548 --> 00:56:15,608
a plan for fbj is something that always

1185
00:56:13,028 --> 00:56:17,768
is thriving in your environment so you

1186
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:20,199
want to look like for something that

1187
00:56:17,768 --> 00:56:22,629
nobody ever takes care of and it always

1188
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:25,328
looks beautiful and green and lush and

1189
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:29,108
the bugs don't even mess with it and so

1190
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:31,450
find those plant you know um like where

1191
00:56:29,108 --> 00:56:32,108
I did we or oh yeah ice plants a good

1192
00:56:31,449 --> 00:56:33,939
one

1193
00:56:32,108 --> 00:56:35,440
also where I live we have tons of

1194
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,838
horsetail right that was the first one I

1195
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,720
tried cuz everyone said oh the silica in

1196
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:43,179
it is is really great for for building

1197
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:45,608
the strength of the cannabis plant sure

1198
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:49,149
yeah or feels great um what are some

1199
00:56:45,608 --> 00:56:52,119
other examples of inputs like silica

1200
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:54,639
that we think about wanting in cannabis

1201
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:57,099
that we can get from other wild crafted

1202
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:59,018
plants just just so people can kind of

1203
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:01,269
get a simmer on the idea of like oh if I

1204
00:56:59,018 --> 00:57:05,649
want you know phosphorus I can use this

1205
00:57:01,268 --> 00:57:10,689
plant well that's something that's kind

1206
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:13,990
of come out of the kind of general

1207
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:17,700
thoughts online that isn't straight out

1208
00:57:13,989 --> 00:57:21,068
of natural farming from Korea that's

1209
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:23,518
that's things that people have kind of

1210
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:25,599
done and that's you know that's not

1211
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:27,459
necessary that's not really something I

1212
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,559
would say is wrong I think those are

1213
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,000
really good start but that's not out of

1214
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:36,490
the traditional natural farming kind of

1215
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,039
process with if we wanted phosphorus or

1216
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:41,558
potassium or calcium some of these

1217
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:44,680
things there's inputs for that water

1218
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:48,800
soluble calcium WCA or water soluble

1219
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:52,489
calcium phosphate WC AP or wcp

1220
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:56,420
so there are solutions for that in the

1221
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:58,369
natural farming toolkit but I think that

1222
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:02,200
that that idea of course sales is

1223
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:07,239
actually it's a great thought process

1224
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:10,969
but there's there's more to it there's

1225
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:13,219
we want a new growth of some of these

1226
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:16,189
plants we're identifying so that those

1227
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:19,309
growing tips is where a plant puts a ton

1228
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:21,920
of its energy they think of T cells and

1229
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:25,329
plant growth hormone and and all this

1230
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:30,139
stuff that that we associate with

1231
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:33,139
potential energy and that's what plants

1232
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:36,109
kind of jams all its energy into its new

1233
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:41,379
growth or it's it's budding fruits so

1234
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:45,700
green fruit is all categorized as fpj

1235
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:50,180
material so if you take you know half

1236
00:58:45,699 --> 00:58:54,319
half-formed apples or you know green

1237
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:57,529
plums that would be an FPGA you could

1238
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:02,539
take rhubarb stalks and their leaves you

1239
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:04,910
could take ice plant or ivy you can take

1240
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:07,579
or you could take grass so you identify

1241
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:10,699
some vibrant grasses you can make an

1242
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:11,239
FPGA out of that so kind of sky's the

1243
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:14,059
limit

1244
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:18,169
dandelion we use dandelion we use

1245
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:20,449
purslane all kinds of things that's

1246
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:22,099
really interesting you just totally put

1247
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:24,739
put my approach to this on its head

1248
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:27,679
because we're not actually looking for

1249
00:59:24,739 --> 00:59:29,689
the specific input for example I use the

1250
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,750
one of the silica in the horse tail

1251
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:36,829
actually we want to get the microbial

1252
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:40,159
level you know lifeforce one level of

1253
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:47,389
magnitude down yeah that's pretty

1254
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:52,629
heavy-duty yeah so so and it's there's

1255
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:55,699
so little of this that we're using it

1256
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:58,640
it's a whole system it's not it's not

1257
00:59:55,699 --> 01:00:01,519
just like extjs the one thing FPGA is a

1258
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:02,489
food for the plants and the microbes and

1259
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:05,579
it is

1260
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:07,259
important and you are getting silica if

1261
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:09,779
you're using horsetail you know that is

1262
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,760
part of it but there's there's more to

1263
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:15,210
it and it's that whole system that you

1264
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:20,340
you're tending to the microbial life in

1265
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:22,949
the soil on the plan itself and and yeah

1266
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:25,170
so yeah it isn't just like identify a

1267
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:27,809
phosphorus rich plant that's that's fine

1268
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:29,340
and you can but but your there's a

1269
01:00:27,809 --> 01:00:33,779
bigger picture yeah your miss yeah

1270
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:35,820
you're missing the love right it's kind

1271
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:37,890
of its kind of a humility you're kind of

1272
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:41,760
like okay there's actually some things

1273
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:45,118
in natures that are beyond the NPK and

1274
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:47,100
then the 23 minor minerals there's

1275
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,079
something beyond this and we're

1276
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:52,110
discovering that as we dig deeper and

1277
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:55,259
understanding by the nutrients and these

1278
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:58,860
you know bio chemicals were realizing

1279
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:01,170
this is actually more complex than we

1280
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:04,289
thought it was yeah that makes a lot of

1281
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:05,789
sense into and to steal the line from

1282
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:07,769
Jeff flow and fells this is like us

1283
01:01:05,789 --> 01:01:09,690
teaming with the nutrients right this is

1284
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:13,650
us saying all right we don't necessarily

1285
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:16,559
understand the life-force magic that

1286
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:19,410
happens you know inside of the new

1287
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,449
growth green you know the green new

1288
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:23,699
growth on the edge of on the tip of the

1289
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:25,649
plant but but we know that if we take it

1290
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:27,449
and and if we fermented it a little bit

1291
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:30,030
to encourage it to make more of it

1292
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:32,789
whatever that you know unknown life

1293
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:36,260
forces becomes multiplied and then our

1294
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:39,239
cannabis plants are freakin stoked

1295
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:41,450
something like that and and in the in

1296
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:44,489
the process we're kind of saying and

1297
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:46,469
we're just trying to partner with nature

1298
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:51,089
we don't we're just trying to take

1299
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:54,299
something that's vibrant and give it you

1300
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:57,750
know into our commercial growing system

1301
01:01:54,300 --> 01:02:00,810
and benefit from what nature is already

1302
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:03,358
doing well right on right on so let's

1303
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:05,340
move on to fish amino acids I haven't

1304
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,340
done this one yet and just that the fish

1305
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:10,980
aspect of it has has caused me to

1306
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:13,410
hesitate a little bit but but but but

1307
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:15,130
please if you will explain you know what

1308
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:18,338
the what the idea behind this is

1309
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:23,019
and what the process looks like so this

1310
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:26,849
is probably one of the best nitrogen

1311
01:02:23,018 --> 01:02:30,719
sources you can do you can get for

1312
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:34,479
teaming with microbial life and and

1313
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:38,288
using things that are really micronized

1314
01:02:34,478 --> 01:02:40,960
so all of natural farming these foliar

1315
01:02:38,289 --> 01:02:45,720
sprays and these inputs are highly

1316
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:48,548
available and micronesia micronized is

1317
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:50,828
nutrient TSA's is really it's a word

1318
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:54,338
that's a thing where through

1319
01:02:50,829 --> 01:02:57,700
fermentation and the breakdown by

1320
01:02:54,338 --> 01:03:00,989
microorganisms of the components and

1321
01:02:57,699 --> 01:03:03,818
these things we're getting this this end

1322
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:07,900
product this material that actually can

1323
01:03:03,818 --> 01:03:11,858
be absorbed by the plant itself without

1324
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:14,108
the need for so like if you apply

1325
01:03:11,858 --> 01:03:16,838
chemical fertilizer or that to ever be

1326
01:03:14,108 --> 01:03:20,048
available to the plant it actually has

1327
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:22,599
to be processed by some microorganism so

1328
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:24,518
you know the people aqua pond or

1329
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:26,170
hydroponic farmers they're always

1330
01:03:24,518 --> 01:03:28,568
bleaching and then they put in their

1331
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:30,190
nutrients and as soon as they put in

1332
01:03:28,568 --> 01:03:32,288
their nutrients and the plant roots they

1333
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:34,479
find that all the plant roots are

1334
01:03:32,289 --> 01:03:36,489
colonized by bacteria and they're like I

1335
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:38,768
just leech why is there this bacteria

1336
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:41,588
for them they're plants even to get

1337
01:03:38,768 --> 01:03:42,848
access to these liquid fertilizers

1338
01:03:41,588 --> 01:03:48,159
they're putting and they need those

1339
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:51,660
bacteria and so for for us fish amino

1340
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:53,498
acid is this is really amazing

1341
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:56,618
fertilizer

1342
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:59,588
there's fish hydrolysates and fish

1343
01:03:56,619 --> 01:04:01,450
emotions that you can buy and both of

1344
01:03:59,588 --> 01:04:04,358
those are good I think rolla say it's a

1345
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:06,189
little better than emotion but really a

1346
01:04:04,358 --> 01:04:09,670
lot of those things they're they're

1347
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:12,009
taking off the fats for a fish oil

1348
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:15,999
product on the side you know so they're

1349
01:04:12,009 --> 01:04:19,599
double dipping in kind of productivity

1350
01:04:15,998 --> 01:04:21,159
or profitability of their product under

1351
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,798
or they're taking off some other

1352
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:25,719
byproducts of the fish and using it

1353
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:28,900
elsewhere so you're not getting the

1354
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:31,599
whole suite of what

1355
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:34,000
like a fish has to offer whereas this

1356
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:39,130
fish amino-acid this fermented whole

1357
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:42,429
fish or or fish waste is the whole thing

1358
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:46,420
and it's being highly micronized by

1359
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:49,059
instead of us cooking it or doing these

1360
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,409
other processes it's being fermented so

1361
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:54,099
the breakdown is happening by

1362
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:56,649
microorganisms yeah it's a great thing

1363
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:59,650
in your plants if you actually make this

1364
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:03,010
in the way that it's supposed to be made

1365
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:05,289
your plants really react and they love

1366
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:07,300
this stuff so well then let's talk about

1367
01:05:05,289 --> 01:05:10,539
how it's supposed to be made do you

1368
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:13,510
really need to use the blue blue backed

1369
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:16,869
fish as it says in the you know the the

1370
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:18,970
you know the original treatise or can

1371
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:20,199
you use it can you use whatever you want

1372
01:05:18,969 --> 01:05:24,849
is there something special about

1373
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:28,079
blue-backed fish yeah so that blue back

1374
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:32,199
fish for for the sake of kind of

1375
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:36,069
translating that culturally and language

1376
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:40,210
its deepwater fish they they've taken on

1377
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:42,940
a different level of or a different

1378
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:47,320
amount of the kind of minerals of the

1379
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:49,869
ocean so farm-raised fish or pond fish

1380
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:53,769
or river fish aren't gonna have quite

1381
01:05:49,869 --> 01:05:56,769
the same kind of mineral tied up in

1382
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:59,380
their systems as deepwater fish are so

1383
01:05:56,769 --> 01:06:03,699
you're getting this kind of complexity

1384
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:09,010
of nutrition for your plants that a deep

1385
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:10,809
water fish has maybe more than a river

1386
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:14,680
fish so that's that's kind of what

1387
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:17,110
that's talking about so can I use what

1388
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:21,730
fish I say say all I have is steel

1389
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:26,019
header or tilapia can I use that and get

1390
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:28,659
a fish fertilizer yeah you can and there

1391
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:32,050
is there is something to this deep water

1392
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:34,420
fish being recommended so just knowing

1393
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:36,610
that okay I don't have the best source

1394
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:38,400
but I have this tilapia that's what I

1395
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:41,320
have available it's cheap and and

1396
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,820
accessible um just know that there there

1397
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,650
might be some benefit if you

1398
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:47,400
you get you know that stuff coming off

1399
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:50,139
the fishing vessels down at the Harbor

1400
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,320
you might get some additional benefit

1401
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:56,469
and that's that's why that's recommended

1402
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:58,930
so up to you you got a autumn Italy

1403
01:06:56,469 --> 01:07:01,239
you're keen on your farm you get to make

1404
01:06:58,929 --> 01:07:05,739
the decisions you want to make and you

1405
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:08,259
can you can do parts of this but the

1406
01:07:05,739 --> 01:07:11,739
year the natural farming has been

1407
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:15,360
thought out very thoroughly and every

1408
01:07:11,739 --> 01:07:18,669
time I dig into the science I find it

1409
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:22,780
sounded a really really good scientific

1410
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:24,550
thought and theory and and truth so yes

1411
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:28,150
so let's say okay so I've either I've

1412
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:30,580
either gone down to the the the harbor

1413
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:33,220
and and bought you know tuna or

1414
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:34,960
something off a boat or or more

1415
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:36,669
realistically the first time I try this

1416
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,349
I'm probably gonna use something you

1417
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:40,300
know less expensive like tilapia or

1418
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:42,250
sardines something that if I screw it up

1419
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,170
you know I won't feel it's quite so bad

1420
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:46,030
about it so so now that I have my fish

1421
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:49,269
how do you go about and stacking this

1422
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:51,430
Fuhrman yeah well let me clarify real

1423
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:55,480
quick if you go down and buy a fresh

1424
01:07:51,429 --> 01:07:57,819
tuna office off the fish make sure you

1425
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:00,820
get the fillets off make yourself some

1426
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:03,910
sashimi and enjoy that with your friends

1427
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:07,450
and only use the bones that guts in the

1428
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:10,449
head for or the carcass the guts in the

1429
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:12,309
head for this fish amino acid don't let

1430
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:16,510
me hear of anybody wasting a perfectly

1431
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:19,689
good tuna fertilizer for yeah that that

1432
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,980
would just be a tragedy so no and I was

1433
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:23,469
thinking that it sounded really

1434
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:25,599
expensive to use at a whole deepwater

1435
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:27,670
fish but but with that with that

1436
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,890
addition what actually might make a lot

1437
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:32,920
more sense is to just go to your your

1438
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:34,600
your local you know Japanese market

1439
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,909
where they prepare and clean the fish

1440
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,490
and just ask them say hey can I come

1441
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:40,989
back at the end of the dragon yeah yeah

1442
01:08:39,489 --> 01:08:42,489
cuz I'm sure they'd be thrilled to give

1443
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:44,679
it to you especially if they say you're

1444
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:46,199
doing something like exotic like this

1445
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:49,030
and be like oh yeah we'll hook you up

1446
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:52,149
yeah this is what that is so yeah don't

1447
01:08:49,029 --> 01:08:55,000
don't confuse this this is cheap this is

1448
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:56,739
supposed to be the the waste product

1449
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,359
Emma and a lot of times

1450
01:08:56,739 --> 01:08:59,710
people are cooking with the head so you

1451
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:01,619
might not even get the heads you might

1452
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:04,960
only get the carcass in the gut and

1453
01:09:01,619 --> 01:09:06,309
that's fine some Asian cultures you're

1454
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,960
not even good at that they're gonna

1455
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:11,170
they're gonna cook with all of that but

1456
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:13,960
um yeah I actually just recently for the

1457
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:14,440
class I taught last November in Boise oh

1458
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:18,880
yeah

1459
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:21,699
I just asked our local sushi shop if if

1460
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,329
they had any fish heads they got all

1461
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:27,250
their tuna came pre filleted so I

1462
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:29,649
couldn't get any tuna but I got all

1463
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:32,590
their salmon heads and carcasses they

1464
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:35,109
gave them a cooler of those to me and so

1465
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:40,090
I I have fish amino-acid brewing in my

1466
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:41,739
office that doesn't smell at all and I

1467
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:44,020
share that that office I have two

1468
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:47,369
offices where I work in that office is

1469
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:50,290
shared with like six other people and

1470
01:09:47,369 --> 01:09:52,569
nobody even knows it's there and it's

1471
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:54,640
basically rotting fish but it that's not

1472
01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:58,899
rotting it's aerobic Lee's fermenting

1473
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:02,230
fish anyways here's the process XO so

1474
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:04,779
you take your fish waste as we've

1475
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:08,919
established not not the filets eat those

1476
01:10:04,779 --> 01:10:12,069
fish waste equal weights brown sugar you

1477
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:18,250
sensing a theme here yeah get it okay

1478
01:10:12,069 --> 01:10:22,179
equal weights brown sugar a dash of IMO

1479
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:23,739
four so I am very intentionally not

1480
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,300
giving you a specific measurement you

1481
01:10:23,739 --> 01:10:27,250
don't have to have a super specific

1482
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:31,260
measurement this is just a light

1483
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:34,119
inoculum so just a handful of IMO for

1484
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:36,880
for that fermentation that kind of

1485
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:38,949
really skewing your your microbes for

1486
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,680
folks who died when I mo for is we've

1487
01:10:38,949 --> 01:10:44,260
recently hit that yeah so that stuff

1488
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,840
I've taken microbes out of my local

1489
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:49,840
forests I've multiplied them out on

1490
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:53,230
substrate it's a it's a four step

1491
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:55,539
process so the number four just refers

1492
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:57,789
to it's the fourth stage in the process

1493
01:10:55,539 --> 01:11:01,180
of taking it out of the forest and

1494
01:10:57,789 --> 01:11:03,970
getting it ready for my farm so it's

1495
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:06,039
just indigenous inoculum so you could

1496
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:08,530
take a handful of leaf litter out of

1497
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:09,819
your local forest if you didn't have IMO

1498
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:13,389
for

1499
01:11:09,819 --> 01:11:15,189
so you handful of inoculum whether it's

1500
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:18,760
leaf litter out of your forest or i am a

1501
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:22,329
poor IMO for is ideal and then just a

1502
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:23,050
little bit of just a splash of Oh hm if

1503
01:11:22,329 --> 01:11:26,529
you have it

1504
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:29,550
Oh HN is another natural farming ferment

1505
01:11:26,529 --> 01:11:33,159
I have a youtube video on how to make it

1506
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:34,480
oriental herbal nutrient anyways don't

1507
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:36,309
worry about those if you don't have

1508
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:38,109
those you could still make this but I

1509
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:40,960
would recommend going out to the forest

1510
01:11:38,109 --> 01:11:43,960
and getting some visible spider webby

1511
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,869
mycelium and a handful and throwing it

1512
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,980
in here but if you don't have that you

1513
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:52,300
can still make it

1514
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:56,259
so the basic process is equal waste

1515
01:11:52,300 --> 01:12:00,820
brown sugar and put it in a cooler and

1516
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:03,220
leave it to ferment over time the

1517
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:05,489
absolute earlier you would want to

1518
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:07,949
extract that in the natural farming

1519
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:10,569
recipe would be three months and

1520
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:13,179
truthfully that's too soon it's not

1521
01:12:10,569 --> 01:12:15,639
going to be finished so best is a year

1522
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:17,289
if you just throw it in a cooler you can

1523
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:19,090
put a lid on it you don't you want to

1524
01:12:17,289 --> 01:12:21,670
whatever you do you want to set it up so

1525
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:24,190
rats or some rodent can't get in and

1526
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:27,239
ruin all your hard work but what I'll

1527
01:12:24,189 --> 01:12:30,639
usually do is stick a mesh over it and

1528
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:32,949
throw a lid on it loosely so no rodents

1529
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:37,630
can get in a little bit a little bit of

1530
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:39,340
air can transfer airflow is positive but

1531
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:41,520
sometimes it's hard to find a container

1532
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:45,250
where it can both breathe and be closed

1533
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:47,080
and protected but yeah then you leave it

1534
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:49,539
for a year whether you'll have is you'll

1535
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:52,630
have just the bones left over and you'll

1536
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:56,619
have this like blackish liquid it'll be

1537
01:12:52,630 --> 01:13:00,520
straight liquid fish and it smells and

1538
01:12:56,619 --> 01:13:03,340
tastes like fish sauce that you buy at

1539
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:06,790
the store for cooking it's really it's

1540
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:09,550
really a positive smell and taste yes

1541
01:13:06,789 --> 01:13:13,149
I've tasted my Fisher miiniwaa acid I

1542
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:17,159
I've made it with fresh tuna off the

1543
01:13:13,149 --> 01:13:19,629
coast of Hawaii and brown sugar and a

1544
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:22,479
handful of IMO four that I made myself

1545
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:26,559
and kept it nice and and

1546
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:27,999
clean and the and a fresh cooler and and

1547
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:31,809
then it came off and it's just a

1548
01:13:27,998 --> 01:13:34,300
beautiful if you can make food with it

1549
01:13:31,809 --> 01:13:35,889
you know this could be instead of making

1550
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:39,070
plant fertilizer you just made fish

1551
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:39,729
sauce for cooking but really it is it's

1552
01:13:39,069 --> 01:13:42,248
great

1553
01:13:39,729 --> 01:13:44,979
cheap fertilizer so how do you know if

1554
01:13:42,248 --> 01:13:48,939
it goes bad right like like like if it

1555
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:50,590
starts to smell is that a good good

1556
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:53,618
suggestion that something went a lot

1557
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:55,328
wrong along the process yeah if you do

1558
01:13:53,618 --> 01:13:57,578
it if you do it according to this recipe

1559
01:13:55,328 --> 01:14:01,018
it really doesn't go bad um but if you

1560
01:13:57,578 --> 01:14:03,578
didn't have an inoculum you could have a

1561
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:07,269
month period where it smells kind of

1562
01:14:03,578 --> 01:14:09,880
foul but that also probably means there

1563
01:14:07,269 --> 01:14:13,479
was something wrong with your ratio of

1564
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:15,909
fish to sugar or something like that if

1565
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:18,849
if you find if it seems like there's way

1566
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:22,708
too much liquid you may need to add a

1567
01:14:18,849 --> 01:14:25,059
little extra sugar if you know that's

1568
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:27,090
anyways you don't worry about that but

1569
01:14:25,059 --> 01:14:30,340
really it shouldn't smell and

1570
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:33,309
something's probably gone wrong

1571
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:36,969
but if you can get just even a handful

1572
01:14:33,309 --> 01:14:39,429
of soil from a wild environment could

1573
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:44,708
could be all you need you just need some

1574
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:46,929
kind of inoculum yeah right on good Wow

1575
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:50,738
all right well this is clearly the the

1576
01:14:46,929 --> 01:14:52,779
longest segment of shaping fire that

1577
01:14:50,738 --> 01:14:55,569
we've ever done here at 50 minutes so

1578
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:57,849
let's go ahead and take our second break

1579
01:14:55,569 --> 01:14:59,738
and we'll be right back you're listening

1580
01:14:57,849 --> 01:15:02,800
to shaping fire and my guest today is

1581
01:14:59,738 --> 01:15:05,708
Korean natural farming educator Chris

1582
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:08,050
Trump while I certainly still enjoy

1583
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:10,569
smoking joints I moved over to using

1584
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:11,979
vaporizers about three years ago the

1585
01:15:10,569 --> 01:15:13,840
high was a little different than burning

1586
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:16,119
the flower and in the end I decided I

1587
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,458
preferred it for daily use especially

1588
01:15:16,118 --> 01:15:20,799
because I have asthma more importantly

1589
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:22,719
though I could taste my flower so much

1590
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,849
more it's hard to express to you how

1591
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,368
significantly different cannabis with a

1592
01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:30,159
good terpene profile tastes when vaped

1593
01:15:27,368 --> 01:15:31,538
instead of burned I have brought my vape

1594
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,399
with me to visit growers and they are

1595
01:15:31,538 --> 01:15:34,809
astonished by the clarity of taste and

1596
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:35,920
they say they feel like they're tasting

1597
01:15:34,809 --> 01:15:39,250
their flower for the very

1598
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:42,069
time the air vape vaporizer from air

1599
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:44,409
vape usa.com is a great device to use on

1600
01:15:42,069 --> 01:15:46,179
the go or at home when you pick it up

1601
01:15:44,409 --> 01:15:46,599
and feel satisfying like a medical

1602
01:15:46,179 --> 01:15:48,579
device

1603
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,770
it isn't flimsy like many vapes are I

1604
01:15:48,579 --> 01:15:52,899
like how the flower is inserted in the

1605
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:54,850
top instead of the bottom so travels are

1606
01:15:52,899 --> 01:15:56,469
shorter path to my mouth with the

1607
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,239
cannabis at the top I get a hit that

1608
01:15:56,469 --> 01:16:00,189
feels more substantial even though I'm

1609
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:02,799
just inhaling vapor and not full bodied

1610
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:05,139
smoke since I use this vape for flower

1611
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,670
hash and concentrates I really like that

1612
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,829
that digital control for the temperature

1613
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:10,239
is right there on the front three clicks

1614
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:12,159
of the button and it fires up to the

1615
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:14,799
temperature I specify really quickly and

1616
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:17,229
discreetly you know vape concentrates

1617
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,730
are a milder experience than dabbing but

1618
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:20,919
you still get the potency in your hit

1619
01:16:18,729 --> 01:16:23,709
also the taste is great as would be

1620
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,659
expected with a low temp tab I love that

1621
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:26,649
this vape gives quick little vibrations

1622
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:29,229
when it gets to the right temperature

1623
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:30,729
that way if I'm chatting or distracted

1624
01:16:29,229 --> 01:16:33,159
while it's heating up it lets me know

1625
01:16:30,729 --> 01:16:35,738
when it's ready if you are ready for a

1626
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:38,469
nice pocket-sized vaporizer consider the

1627

air vape the new air vape ex has just

1628
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:42,219
come out and it's gorgeous and it

1629

about the air vape vaporizer at air vape

1631
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:49,629
usa.com if you grow cannabis with

1632
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:51,550
sunshine you can often feel limited by

1633
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:53,500
the seasonal cycle you want to grow

1634
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:55,600
sustainably and save money so you use as

1635
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,340
little electricity as possible but if

1636
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,719
you haven't studied or implemented light

1637
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,130
deprivation techniques into your

1638
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,529
greenhouse you're leaving a lot of money

1639
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:03,909
on the table by incorporating light

1640
01:17:02,529 --> 01:17:05,649
deprivation solutions into your

1641
01:17:03,909 --> 01:17:07,300
greenhouse you can often add two or

1642
01:17:05,649 --> 01:17:09,488
three additional growing cycles to your

1643
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,900
year when you pencil out the financial

1644
01:17:09,488 --> 01:17:13,000
benefit of those additional cycles

1645
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:15,159
you'll realize why commercial scale

1646
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,448
light deprivation technology is remaking

1647
01:17:15,159 --> 01:17:18,760
the cannabis industry

1648
01:17:16,448 --> 01:17:20,738
what used to be done by pulling tarps

1649
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,060
over hoop houses has been scaled up over

1650
01:17:20,738 --> 01:17:23,979
the last few years in such a way that

1651
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:25,660
it's become mechanized easy and

1652
01:17:23,979 --> 01:17:28,479
affordable to even small-scale

1653
01:17:25,659 --> 01:17:30,579
commercial cannabis operations forever

1654
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:32,468
flowering greenhouses is the industry

1655
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:34,269
leader in light deprivation greenhouse

1656
01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:36,279
design in operation for the commercial

1657
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:37,900
cannabis industry their team of

1658
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:39,429
greenhouse experts have been in the

1659
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:40,779
fields of Northern California for

1660
01:17:39,429 --> 01:17:42,369
decades and they're now building

1661
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:45,279
greenhouses for commercial cannabis

1662
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:46,750
companies across the country if you are

1663
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:48,309
new to light dep and growing in

1664
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,659
greenhouses i encourage you to go back

13 with guests Eric Branstad of forever

1667
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:55,990
flowering I talked with Eric about the

1668
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:57,789
importance of intelligent greenhouse

1669
01:17:55,989 --> 01:17:59,800
management as well as the huge financial

1670
01:17:57,789 --> 01:18:02,529
benefit of incorporating light depth

1671
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,270
techniques there are so many aspects of

1672
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:06,579
utilizing a greenhouse that can go wrong

1673
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:08,770
from temperature and airflow to light

1674
01:18:06,579 --> 01:18:10,479
DEP and workflow forever flowering will

well-cared-for flowers they can help you

1677
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,900
retrofit your existing greenhouse with

1678
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,760
light depth and other modern systems at

1679
01:18:16,899 --> 01:18:20,379
a level that fits your budget if you're

1680

shaping fire I'm your host Shango Lowe's

1693
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:50,769
and our guest this week is Chris Trump

1694
01:18:46,869 --> 01:18:52,659
Korean natural farming educator so if

1695
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:54,730
you're still with us after the second

1696
01:18:52,659 --> 01:18:57,970
set I appreciate you staying with us you

1697
01:18:54,729 --> 01:19:00,219
are either here for Chris Trump and

1698
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:03,039
you're not a regular listener or if you

1699
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:05,409
are a regular listener you just totally

1700
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:07,600
got indoctrinated into Korean natural

1701
01:19:05,409 --> 01:19:09,489
farming so here on this last set we're

1702
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,500
gonna talk about a couple different

1703
01:19:09,489 --> 01:19:13,449
topics and the first one we're gonna

1704
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:15,699
start out with is one of my favorite

1705
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:17,500
since I live on an island here and

1706
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:19,569
that's fermented seawater and I got a

1707
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,819
taker so when I first you know read this

1708
01:19:19,569 --> 01:19:25,569
I thought it was a typo or something how

1709
01:19:21,819 --> 01:19:30,399
do we go about fermenting seawater it's

1710
01:19:25,569 --> 01:19:32,710
it's really cool because it the it's

1711
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:36,099
kind of philosophically and natural

1712
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:39,220
farming the concept is we we we rose out

1713
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:44,650
of the ocean ocean is the mother of life

1714
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:48,850
and so you have all the ocean you know

1715
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:52,170
mineral components and soil and human

1716
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:57,220
blood is very similar and actually plant

1717
01:19:52,170 --> 01:20:01,109
blood quote unquote or cytoplasm is very

1718
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:02,820
similar to seawater as well and actually

1719
01:20:01,109 --> 01:20:08,039
plant

1720
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:11,880
um quote blood is very similar to

1721
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:14,670
seawater diluted at a rate of one to

1722
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:17,460
thirty and so in natural farming you'll

1723
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:20,180
see sea water is used at a dilution rate

1724
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:23,460
of one to thirty basically you're using

1725
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:26,610
something very similar to plant blood

1726
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:28,529
like so when we're at the hospital we

1727
01:20:26,609 --> 01:20:33,119
maybe got dehydrated or something we're

1728
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:36,659
getting an IV of saline because it helps

1729
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:40,829
us you know process stress or

1730
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:44,159
dehydration and this is really actually

1731
01:20:40,829 --> 01:20:49,019
a quite similar concept fermented

1732
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:51,300
seawater is giving some microbes access

1733
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:54,690
to all those great minor minerals and

1734
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:58,829
seawater along with some plant material

1735
01:20:54,689 --> 01:21:03,869
so fermented seawater is ocean water one

1736
01:20:58,829 --> 01:21:07,880
to thirty el ap one to seven hundred and

1737
01:21:03,869 --> 01:21:11,609
I think fpj one to three hundred um

1738
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:15,180
somewhere in there sorry off the top of

1739
01:21:11,609 --> 01:21:18,299
my head but it's it's fermented for 24

1740
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:20,250
hours you can ferment it longer or store

1741
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:22,800
it in a vessel and it can just kind of

1742
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:26,100
stay for mented seawater but if you're

1743
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,699
raising animal and you want to kind of

1744
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:33,840
cheaply better your pasture lands is a

1745
01:21:29,699 --> 01:21:36,539
great great thing to spray on grassland

1746
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:39,779
it's also just something you can spray

1747
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:43,170
on your crops somewhat regularly you

1748
01:21:39,779 --> 01:21:47,670
know weekly or every other week with a

1749
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:50,069
great result and again almost no car so

1750
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:52,079
the the ratios that you give for the

1751
01:21:50,069 --> 01:21:55,769
inputs those ratios are all to

1752
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:57,329
freshwater right yep right on yep does

1753
01:21:55,770 --> 01:22:00,380
it matter and I'm assuming that with

1754
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:04,050
most of these things we want to use

1755
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:06,210
rainwater is probably best or perhaps

1756
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:08,119
our Oh but we want to stay away from our

1757
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:10,319
chlorinated tap water I would assume

1758
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:14,159
yeah if you want to stay away from

1759
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:16,288
chlorinated tap water ro is actually

1760
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:22,618
really a

1761
01:22:16,288 --> 01:22:25,259
vacuum minerally speaking so it's like

1762
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:28,348
distilled water and ro are fairly

1763
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:30,208
similar and you want to be careful that

1764
01:22:28,349 --> 01:22:33,958
can be kind of shocking to plants

1765
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:39,929
actually because it's so young stuff out

1766
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:41,938
yeah it the water is so readily bonded

1767
01:22:39,929 --> 01:22:44,939
to so many things that it actually can

1768
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:47,909
pass through your system and drom and a

1769
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:50,309
little rather than you know and make it

1770
01:22:47,908 --> 01:22:53,848
back and have consequences yeah that's

1771
01:22:50,309 --> 01:22:55,139
interesting right on so so you you make

1772
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:58,168
it in this that you put it together

1773
01:22:55,139 --> 01:23:01,349
fresh water with the with this salt

1774
01:22:58,168 --> 01:23:04,529
water the fpj and what was the third

1775
01:23:01,349 --> 01:23:05,458
ingredient la B Oh though I yeah that's

1776
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:07,588
right baby

1777
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:09,118
and and then how long do you let it

1778
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:11,639
ferment how do you how do you know when

1779
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:14,938
you're you're ready to go it's just 24

1780
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:16,769
hours so you can go longer but yeah la B

1781
01:23:14,939 --> 01:23:20,099
is that thing we make with the rice wash

1782
01:23:16,769 --> 01:23:23,789
and the milk that serum and so your your

1783
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:31,078
that's your fermenter your plant juice

1784
01:23:23,788 --> 01:23:34,338
is kind of like a nutrient and and this

1785
01:23:31,078 --> 01:23:36,358
came over hundreds of years of

1786
01:23:34,338 --> 01:23:39,868
observation of different things that

1787
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:43,499
farmers did where basically they found

1788
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:46,848
that if they took you know these minor

1789
01:23:43,498 --> 01:23:50,878
minerals and some plant component

1790
01:23:46,849 --> 01:23:54,689
through fermentation the leftover liquid

1791
01:23:50,878 --> 01:23:57,988
is gangbuster cool things to crops and

1792
01:23:54,689 --> 01:23:59,729
there was often done accidentally or you

1793
01:23:57,988 --> 01:24:03,509
know so like in Korea they make kimchi

1794
01:23:59,729 --> 01:24:05,668
and the kimchi water dumped out all

1795
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:07,530
their plants wherever they dumped their

1796
01:24:05,668 --> 01:24:10,918
kimchi water went ballistic and where

1797
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:12,688
the tastiest and sweetest and so they

1798
01:24:10,918 --> 01:24:15,048
found that though that mineral that

1799
01:24:12,689 --> 01:24:18,269
minor mineral allows plants to do

1800
01:24:15,048 --> 01:24:20,878
complex sugar making which we associate

1801
01:24:18,269 --> 01:24:22,469
with flavor yeah that makes sense and

1802
01:24:20,878 --> 01:24:25,139
the other thing you know not only does

1803
01:24:22,469 --> 01:24:27,899
the seawater have all of those those

1804
01:24:25,139 --> 01:24:30,210
micro minerals but it also has got

1805
01:24:27,899 --> 01:24:34,079
you know entirely different communities

1806
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:36,689
of you know microbial activity and so

1807
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:41,670
yeah and you you've you feed those guys

1808
01:24:36,689 --> 01:24:43,229
some some FPGA and wait which do you say

1809
01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:45,510
fermented fruit juice or the plant juice

1810
01:24:43,229 --> 01:24:47,639
goes into this plant you play oh yes

1811
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:50,600
right so you give them that nutrient I

1812
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:54,630
bet you they would multiply superfast

1813
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:57,179
yeah and for those landlocked people if

1814
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:59,190
you don't have a ocean water or you got

1815
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:01,289
to drive eight hours to get some and

1816
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:05,279
that's just not realistic

1817
01:25:01,289 --> 01:25:08,579
you could get some sea salt and put it

1818
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:12,420
into water at a rate of 30 grams per

1819
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:14,640
liter to make the basically that's sea

1820
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:17,039
water 30 grams to one liter of fresh

1821
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:18,690
water is now you have a bottle of

1822
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:21,390
seawater and then you can dilute that

1823
01:25:18,689 --> 01:25:24,000
one to thirty or if you wanted to skip

1824
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:26,010
the dilution step you put one gram per

1825
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,679
one liter and then you have a solution

1826
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:30,539
of one to thirty or it's a great excuse

1827
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:32,250
to go on a beach vacation just bring

1828
01:25:30,539 --> 01:25:34,289
there you go bring back water with you

1829
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,500
just do it fast because I'm sure that

1830
01:25:34,289 --> 01:25:40,229
those microbes don't like to hang out in

1831
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:43,469
containers very long no you know sea

1832
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:46,139
water seeps really nicely no in

1833
01:25:43,469 --> 01:25:48,300
landlocked places in Korea they actually

1834
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:50,489
go and they'll get a tanker and they

1835
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:52,800
fill these they have these underground

1836
01:25:50,488 --> 01:25:54,569
storage back and they just stow these

1837
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,989
big old bat's and then that they need it

1838
01:25:54,569 --> 01:26:00,119
they pull it out oh great so let's talk

1839
01:25:57,988 --> 01:26:01,559
about water soluble minerals I mean we

1840
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:04,170
talked about that a little bit earlier

1841
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:06,870
when when you redirected me about the

1842
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:09,630
silica that I from the horsetail I was

1843
01:26:06,869 --> 01:26:11,219
using and you you alluded to that that

1844
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:14,310
you know there's actually something in

1845
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:16,079
Korean natural farming for these these

1846
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:17,520
minerals in case you want to you know

1847
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:19,050
turn if you've got to turn up your

1848
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,420
calcium if you've got to turn up your

1849
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:23,400
phosphoric acid so why don't you break

1850
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:27,000
down what water soluble minerals are in

1851
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:30,750
KNF yeah there's there's a lot of

1852
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,960
there's a lot of those and and some of

1853
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:36,029
them are with with acid and rock and and

1854
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,908
that's some some proprietary things that

1855
01:26:36,029 --> 01:26:40,259
master Cho does and that knowledge will

1856
01:26:38,908 --> 01:26:42,049
kind of trickle out over the next

1857
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:45,570
several years

1858
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:48,800
but the the basics and that are really

1859
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:51,299
important are water soluble calcium

1860
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:54,480
phosphate so that's kind of your

1861
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:58,350
phosphorous water soluble calcium and

1862
01:26:54,479 --> 01:27:02,609
then water soluble potassium wsk so

1863
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:06,000
those are WCA is the calcium that UCP is

1864
01:27:02,609 --> 01:27:10,589
sometimes used or WC AP for calcium

1865
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:13,050
phosphate and then wsk for potassium

1866
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:17,600
sorry I just rattled those off and then

1867
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:20,400
to create them I have some videos on

1868
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:24,360
phosphorus and calcium you can check out

1869
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:27,029
on youtube but the basic recipe is that

1870
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:28,920
you take eggshells or if you had access

1871
01:27:27,029 --> 01:27:31,710
to coral sand you could use that too but

1872
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:35,460
eggshells you heat them in a pan until

1873
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:38,939
they kind of they kind of cook past so

1874
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:43,199
the organic matter kind of chars off and

1875
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:45,869
you have just kind of the the calcium of

1876
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:48,179
eggshells you throw them in brown rice

1877
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:50,399
vinegar so now you have this highly

1878
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:52,740
basic material this calcium rich

1879
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,569
material and you throw it in an acid and

1880
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:58,319
you get a chemical reaction where the

1881
01:27:54,569 --> 01:28:00,719
acid Yanks out all this calcium and you

1882
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:03,840
take calcium now you have calcium in

1883
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:06,090
solution or micronized through that

1884
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,279
chemical process so you have a water

1885
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:10,770
soluble calcium highly plant-available

1886
01:28:08,279 --> 01:28:13,829
and we use that as a rate of one to a

1887
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:15,960
thousand and then for phosphorus we

1888
01:28:13,829 --> 01:28:20,130
taking bones so any any old butcher

1889
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:23,130
bones or whatever you have you could

1890
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:26,400
even go out to a ranch and get you know

1891
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:29,520
Sun bleached bones out out on the range

1892
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:32,009
and take them you throw them on the fire

1893
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,320
you char them basically like you want to

1894
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:36,119
make biochar so if you have a biochar

1895
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:38,519
process already that's great but you

1896
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:40,829
char them so they're past the organic

1897
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,450
matter so they're just down you've kind

1898
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:44,519
of you kind of charred off all the

1899
01:28:42,449 --> 01:28:47,399
organic matter and they're down to kind

1900
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:49,860
of their mineral and so they're they're

1901
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:52,949
kind of a solid black even some some

1902
01:28:49,859 --> 01:28:55,348
white on the edges turning to ash isn't

1903
01:28:52,949 --> 01:28:57,719
terrible but if it's all white its

1904
01:28:55,349 --> 01:28:59,939
on the ash it's really not good you want

1905
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:02,849
to get it kind of at the point where

1906
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:05,010
it's um even if it's some mash it's fine

1907
01:29:02,849 --> 01:29:07,679
even if it's some white but if you don't

1908
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:10,139
want it to be brown where it's still got

1909
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:12,139
a bunch of organic matter so I have I

1910
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:16,288
show that in the video but it's it's

1911
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:19,229
down to its mineral again you throw that

1912
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:22,559
in a brown rice vinegar and it reacts

1913
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:24,719
and Yanks out all that mineral and puts

1914
01:29:22,559 --> 01:29:27,599
it into solution and you can spray that

1915
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:30,118
Fowley early and it's highly

1916
01:29:27,599 --> 01:29:32,748
plant-available so that helps you as the

1917
01:29:30,118 --> 01:29:36,389
specific stages and plant development

1918
01:29:32,748 --> 01:29:40,378
you know in in vegetative growth you're

1919
01:29:36,389 --> 01:29:44,939
going to want that calcium kind of kind

1920
01:29:40,378 --> 01:29:48,090
of banging in there in more so and then

1921
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:50,399
in that changeover as it goes just

1922
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:51,989
before it goes into flowering in natural

1923
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:55,739
farming will encourage the use of the

1924
01:29:51,988 --> 01:30:02,839
water soluble calcium phosphate and and

1925
01:29:55,738 --> 01:30:06,328
then some more as it makes makes it free

1926
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:10,139
for folks who have never done biochar

1927
01:30:06,328 --> 01:30:14,099
and the idea of of you know you charring

1928
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:16,498
this stuff is new how long would you say

1929
01:30:14,099 --> 01:30:19,529
and I haven't actually done bone you

1930
01:30:16,498 --> 01:30:21,538
know if you're gonna say take a take a

1931
01:30:19,529 --> 01:30:24,509
small amount of bones and put it in a

1932
01:30:21,538 --> 01:30:27,929
like an old coffee can or something and

1933
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:29,699
and and then cover it with foil and you

1934
01:30:27,929 --> 01:30:32,429
put it on the grill or something like

1935
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:34,078
that how long would you say that it

1936
01:30:32,429 --> 01:30:36,779
would take for bone to reach this

1937
01:30:34,078 --> 01:30:39,029
mineral state we're shooting for you

1938
01:30:36,779 --> 01:30:41,488
know it's really gonna depend on what

1939
01:30:39,029 --> 01:30:44,219
your setup is if you're just doing it on

1940
01:30:41,488 --> 01:30:47,009
an open grill with an open fire you can

1941
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:49,288
kind of watch it change so that might be

1942
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:50,939
a way to do it initially but it kind of

1943
01:30:49,288 --> 01:30:54,328
if you're doing some kind of enclosed

1944
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:57,749
thing it's gonna depend on your CV your

1945
01:30:54,328 --> 01:31:02,279
fire and how you set it up but on the

1946
01:30:57,748 --> 01:31:05,340
grill open flame it takes probably 30

1947
01:31:02,279 --> 01:31:08,158
minutes if you're just turning it with

1948
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:08,819
some barbecue tongs or something right

1949
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:10,679
on and that's what I

1950
01:31:08,819 --> 01:31:12,210
is going for is I I just wanted to hear

1951
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:14,399
that 30 minutes so people understood

1952
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:16,859
this is not like a five-hour thing this

1953
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:18,809
is actually even though we made it sound

1954
01:31:16,859 --> 01:31:21,328
a little more exotic you know with the

1955
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:23,880
bones it's it's actually you know not

1956
01:31:21,328 --> 01:31:25,639
not all that hard to do the recipe once

1957
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,828
you have the bones I mean clearly the

1958
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:32,550
eggshells are a lot easier to get yeah

1959
01:31:28,828 --> 01:31:35,279
yeah yeah so so to finish off the show

1960
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:37,980
Chris I want to reward all of the hard

1961
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:40,488
core Korean natural farming folks who

1962
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:43,799
not only recommended you for the show

1963
01:31:40,488 --> 01:31:45,448
but also were like cheering me on for

1964
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,880
having you on the show cuz you know

1965
01:31:45,448 --> 01:31:48,779
you're you are you were certainly a you

1966
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,578
know I don't think you'd refer to

1967
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:53,880
yourself as a celebrity but I can refer

1968
01:31:50,578 --> 01:31:55,469
to you as a celebrity in KNF so so I

1969
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:58,949
want to invite you to go over my head

1970
01:31:55,469 --> 01:32:01,319
right I only know what to ask you based

1971
01:31:58,948 --> 01:32:04,049
on the little bit I've learned so far

1972
01:32:01,319 --> 01:32:06,210
and and the you know the questions that

1973
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:08,400
people suggested me so so I'd like you

1974
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:10,408
to go over my head and and talk about

1975
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:13,109
something that that you're excited about

1976
01:32:10,408 --> 01:32:16,170
right now that will be you know a nice

1977
01:32:13,109 --> 01:32:18,269
reward to the KNF people who stayed with

1978
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:21,060
us throughout the show and we're waiting

1979
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:24,360
for you to like drop something you know

1980
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:26,010
heavy over my head so so so please if

1981
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:27,479
you would you know what what have you

1982
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:29,360
been excited about recently that you

1983
01:32:27,479 --> 01:32:33,238
that you want to share

1984
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:38,789
yeah there's um you know this this

1985
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:42,029
journey and kmf is if it's deep because

1986
01:32:38,789 --> 01:32:44,899
it's really a pursuit of understanding

1987
01:32:42,029 --> 01:32:48,710
and partnering with nature which it's

1988
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:53,069
the interconnectivity is mind boggling

1989
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:55,679
and the science is just kind of

1990
01:32:53,069 --> 01:32:58,679
beginning to scratch the surface of how

1991
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:01,289
things are interconnected one thing I'm

1992
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:03,690
really enjoying something I'm kind of

1993
01:33:01,289 --> 01:33:07,519
pursuing and playing with is substrates

1994
01:33:03,689 --> 01:33:12,210
for growing out IMO and some of the best

1995
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:17,219
media for that and what I found over the

1996
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:19,500
years is that there's there's things

1997
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:22,710
that certain microbes like better to

1998
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:26,429
chew on than other things and so

1999
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:29,520
in Korea they use a rice bran to grow to

2000
01:33:26,429 --> 01:33:33,658
do this I am a one through our IMO three

2001
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:37,890
and four process and rice bran is rich

2002
01:33:33,658 --> 01:33:41,158
in fat in the u.s. they started doing

2003
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:43,110
Mill Run because it was the kind of

2004
01:33:41,158 --> 01:33:47,759
comparable thing that was cheap and

2005
01:33:43,109 --> 01:33:49,019
readily available like a agricultural

2006
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:53,119
by-product that was readily available

2007
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:59,159
but as we've looked at it Mill Run is

2008
01:33:53,119 --> 01:34:02,550
way lower in fat content than a rice

2009
01:33:59,158 --> 01:34:09,479
bran so as far as fungal food

2010
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:14,070
specifically fungi love facts so the the

2011
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:18,049
cell wall of a plant is full of fats so

2012
01:34:14,069 --> 01:34:23,399
it's these these complex and tied up fat

2013
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:25,320
chains but but cell walls are full of

2014
01:34:23,399 --> 01:34:27,869
them in like in plant cells so that

2015
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:32,069
silica you know people are like oh

2016
01:34:27,869 --> 01:34:36,960
silica is great well why does silica why

2017
01:34:32,069 --> 01:34:39,719
is there so much and and my microbes

2018
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,908
that that smaller you know bacteria is

2019
01:34:39,719 --> 01:34:44,579
really easy everybody's buying these

2020
01:34:41,908 --> 01:34:48,420
facilities and and stuff but these these

2021
01:34:44,579 --> 01:34:51,658
fungi these these microbes that tend to

2022
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:53,750
have relationship with plants in a

2023
01:34:51,658 --> 01:34:58,229
unique way in their root structure

2024
01:34:53,750 --> 01:35:00,300
really require some of these I'm saying

2025
01:34:58,229 --> 01:35:04,129
that but these lipids and these these

2026
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:07,260
things that we you know like silica

2027
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:09,929
where was this kind of these complex

2028
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:12,119
chains that are created and fungi get in

2029
01:35:09,929 --> 01:35:14,579
and they break apart these these fatty

2030
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:18,658
acid chains and they use the acids and

2031
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:22,050
the lipids and so what I found is that

2032
01:35:18,658 --> 01:35:25,019
the this the substrate are important so

2033
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:26,699
in Hawaii I switched from using like

2034
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:29,100
messing around with mill room and they

2035
01:35:26,698 --> 01:35:32,099
used a byproduct from our industry which

2036
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:36,390
was kind of off grading macadamia nut

2037
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:39,690
and I combine that with carbon

2038
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:42,780
like a macadamia shell or wood chip or

2039
01:35:39,689 --> 01:35:46,529
sawdust and I found incredible fungal

2040
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:50,969
growth and diversity could be fostered

2041
01:35:46,529 --> 01:35:53,069
in that kind of a substrate and so um

2042
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:57,570
yeah I'd encourage you if you can find

2043
01:35:53,069 --> 01:36:01,019
rice bran or some of these other grains

2044
01:35:57,569 --> 01:36:04,170
that have their own decent fat profile

2045
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:07,580
that might be cool to bring in to your

2046
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:13,230
your material as you make your IMO three

2047
01:36:07,579 --> 01:36:17,039
as a food for your your bigger organisms

2048
01:36:13,229 --> 01:36:18,509
like a large Highfill diameter fungi you

2049
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:21,659
know because they they are really

2050
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:24,119
important in the whole process of

2051
01:36:21,659 --> 01:36:27,479
cultivating a soil food web in your in

2052
01:36:24,119 --> 01:36:29,489
your farm you know it makes sense to

2053
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:33,149
write because Mill Run is going to be so

2054
01:36:29,489 --> 01:36:34,920
processed and and and the and the Rice's

2055
01:36:33,149 --> 01:36:38,429
you know it's got the full fat it would

2056
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:40,800
make sense that that would be more of

2057
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:44,460
what nature wants to respond to instead

2058
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:47,279
of a thinned out processed product yeah

2059
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:49,980
yeah it's it's it's fun it's a fun

2060
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:52,259
journey just I kind of you know see how

2061
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:55,439
we can cultivate what nature already

2062
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:56,789
does yeah right on well Chris thank you

2063
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:59,099
so much for coming on this show

2064
01:36:56,789 --> 01:37:01,079
especially for such a long episode and

2065
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:03,750
and and not only you know teaching us

2066
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:05,909
and sharing your experience but you know

2067
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:07,520
you've been at this for a lot of years

2068
01:37:05,909 --> 01:37:11,460
so for you to be able to you know

2069
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:13,410
capsulize it and give it context really

2070
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:16,409
allows the rest of us who are new to

2071
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:18,539
this to to jump in the deep end of the

2072
01:37:16,409 --> 01:37:23,069
pool a lot faster so thank you very much

2073
01:37:18,539 --> 01:37:25,199
yeah man pleasure so if you enjoyed this

2074
01:37:23,069 --> 01:37:27,569
episode be sure to follow Chris's

2075
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:29,189
youtube channel and it doesn't have a

2076
01:37:27,569 --> 01:37:33,630
forward slash all you need to do though

2077
01:37:29,189 --> 01:37:35,429
is to just search Chris Trump and KNF er

2078
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:37,920
actually I got it just by putting in

2079
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:39,659
Chris Trump you can follow his Instagram

2080
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,090
which you know it's a mix of both

2081
01:37:39,659 --> 01:37:42,689
growing and personal stuff and that's at

2082
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:46,440
ford slash

2083
01:37:42,689 --> 01:37:48,389
soil steward on Instagram he's got a new

2084
01:37:46,439 --> 01:37:49,979
website up that is just being filled out

2085
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:52,619
now so it's probably going to be

2086
01:37:49,979 --> 01:37:54,179
you know in a month or two but but that

2087
01:37:52,619 --> 01:37:57,630
you know you bookmark it for now that's

2088
01:37:54,180 --> 01:38:00,480
that natural farming dot CEO is his

2089
01:37:57,630 --> 01:38:03,060
website also Chris has got a class

2090
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:06,389
coming up you can find it on Eventbrite

2091
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:08,970
it's it's coming up in July of 2018 and

2092
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:10,500
it's in Idaho so you know if you if you

2093
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:13,890
if you were thinking you had to fly to

2094
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:15,659
Hawaii you do not have to and so so you

2095
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:17,760
can search that on Eventbrite and

2096
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:20,670
finally I want to remind you again to

2097
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:23,940
check out both the Korean natural

2098
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:26,310
farming group on Facebook and also the

2099
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:26,939
probiotic farmers Alliance group also on

2100
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:28,260
