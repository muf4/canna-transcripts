3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,599
passionate you probably wouldn't be

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,599
listening to this podcast and passionate

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,278
people get excited and when I get

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,800
excited sometimes I want to do all the

7
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,239
things I want to do everything at once I

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
don't want to leave anything out I want

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,879
to have all the

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
experiences and usually that works out

11
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:31,559
for me life can be great like that and

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
often it can be exhausting and sometimes

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,600
I screw stuff up because I'm trying to

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
do too much at the same time today's

balance it's about building your soil

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,719

welcome to episode

63
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,719
114 my guest today is Daniel Stein

64
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,000
Daniel Stein was born in Humble County

65
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,159
and grew up in Hawaii he went to college

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,080
first for engineering and then for soils

67
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,318
forestry and eventually environmental

68
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,480
science he started farming vegetables

69
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:33,598
and cannabis in Hawaii doing lettuce

70
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,679
farming and permaculture installations

71
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,000
while caretaking a citrus and avocado

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,159
Orchard in the jungle on land that was

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,280
part of Terrence McKenna's

74
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:43,799
ethnobotanical Gardens in fact Daniel

75
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,519
returned to the home in humbold where he

76
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,400
was born and started gardening and

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,039
farming in 2000 in 2010 he met his wife

78
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,039
Taylor and they became bryceland Forest

79
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:57,239
Farm they started selling vegetables at

80
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,840
farmers markets in 2011 in 2016 they

81
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,680
entered the regulated cannabis Market in

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,799
in 2017 bryceland Forest Farm won the

83
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,920
regenerative cannabis farm award that

84
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,680
was a great year at Emerald cup nowadays

85
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,759
they grow about 3/4 of an acre of

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,080
vegetables 5,000 ft of cannabis and a

87
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,399
small Orchard and perennial garden all

88
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,719
low or no

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,519
till today we're going to use Daniel's

90
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,598
parcel as an example of how to approach

91
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,920
growing regeneratively on your own new

92
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,719
parcel or transitioning from petroleum

93
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,039
and salt fertilizers to regenerative

94
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,878
growing the lessons learned from his

95
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,519
parcel can likely be transferred to

96
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,079
yours as well during the first set we'll

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,759
talk about assessing your property for

98
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,159
cannabis cultivation building soil and

99
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,959
choosing cover crops and companion

100
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:44,598
plants for cannabis in the second set we

101
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,000
will discuss water sequestration animal

102
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,919
husbandry and animal fertilizers and if

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,318
crop rotation applies to cannabis and we

104
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,919
finished the episode considering

105
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,679
controlled fire burs long-term research

106
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,238
opportunities and the economics of

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,519
growing cannabis regeneratively welcome

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,560
to shaping fire Daniel

109
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,360
oh happy to be here thank you so much

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,759
for giving us some of your time on a on

111
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,439
a busy midweek Tuesday during the Spring

112
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,959
I know that you have got to be totally

113
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:12,438
busy on the farm right now getting

114
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,199
everything in place for the summer crops

115
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:16,199
absolutely but it it's really nice to

116
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,319
have the excuse and opportunity to sit

117
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,879
down for a minute excellent fantastic um

118
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,519
uh I like that you have set up Outdoors

119
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,360
um I think this is the first time I've

120
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,799
ever had somebody set up Outdoors so so

121
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,600
you dear listener can enjoy the uh the

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,000
the birds of humble during the interview

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,240
and I can too excellent so let's get

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,918
right into it so you know um I

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,439
understand that when you arrived on your

126
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,439
property you knew you had a lot to do to

127
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,240
make your property into a functional

128
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,000
farm and and I think that's the case

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,960
with a lot of new

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
homesteaders what were the biggest

131
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,399
concerns or projects that you knew you

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,560
needed to address first off in order to

133
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,198
build out your

134
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,759
farm so I I mean on a homestead level

135
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,919
the first thing was making sure I had a

136
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:06,360
place to stay but but on on the the land

137
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:09,159
level the the property had been um

138
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,759
unmaintained for quite a long time so in

139
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,080
terms of gardening the first thing I had

140
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,919
to do is reclear the space where we're

141
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,399
in a forest environment and the forest

142
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:20,879
had had re- encroached a lot of tree

143
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,159
seedlings uh Himalaya Blackberry white

144
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,918
Thorn various plants that that had re

145
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,960
encroached on on historic Garden spaces

146
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,318
so my first order business was was to

147
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,159
get to clear

148
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,080
some burning some chipping when I could

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,840
borrow a chipper I had very little

150
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,279
resources at the time and then um for

151
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,038
cultivating cannabis which which I was

152
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,679
really excited to do here um was

153
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:49,038
building a greenhouse when I came back

154
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,959
onto the property uh it was 2000 and uh

155
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:55,399
we were in the 215 days where it was

156
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,079
vague what what the legality was but if

157
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,599
you hid it in a greenhouse where they

158
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,560
couldn't see it and get a warrant you

159
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,960
were you were pretty safe safe so

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
clearing enough space building a

161
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,680
greenhouse and then as I started to

162
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
build out the garden as it was cleared

163
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,439
my next order of business was getting a

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,800
soil test so I I knew what I was dealing

165
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,478
with and knew my approach to bringing

166
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,639
that soil and that gardening space to a

167
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,120
place where it was productive again

168
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,240
right on I want to hit on a couple of

169
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,598
those let's let's start with the

170
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,560
clearing so um I don't have a big parcel

171
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:28,918
my my farm is pretty small it's actually

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,120
more like a homestead with a big garden

173
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,598
and um you know I know that when it gets

174
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,199
right down to it if I want to clear

175
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,918
something and want it to be if I want it

176
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,439
to stay clear I need to clear it down to

177
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,959
the roots um it sounds like you've done

178
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,240
a lot of clearing for people who are new

179
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,399
to their property and they they need to

180
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,360
clear things um like uh like Scotch

181
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,318
broom where I live which is absolutely

182
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,840
heinous um um did you learn any tricks

183
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,439
about clearing that that you would

184
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:01,519
recommend to somebody who is new at

185
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,519
clearing um do it while you're young

186
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,478
um scotch broom specifically there's

187
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,439
great tools for that and and some of

188
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,359
those tools like a weed wrench and and

189
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,680
various tools that are specifically for

190
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,080
for small Woody things under under an

191
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,720
inch diameter stems that give you

192
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,478
leverage to pull things out are

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,560
wonderful they work somewhat for

194
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,560
Blackberry one of the things I've

195
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,759
learned in Land Development is it's

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,360
really worth just doing it right from

197
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,240
the start you know I didn't have a lot

198
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,280
of resources at the time I was doing

199
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,560
this it would have been worth it to hire

200
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,239
a a mini excavator or rent one and and

201
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,839
just just get it done from the start do

202
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,918
that land disturbance early on on land

203
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,000
that you're already transitioning from

204
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:51,478
one thing to another where the

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,720
disturbance won't make as big of an

206
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,839
impact do the disturbance and then heal

207
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,039
the disturbance with with kind of the

208
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,038
new paradigm of of of a different uh

209
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,839
uh

210
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,360
biological uh pattern happening I like

211
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,079
the suggestion that you're making that

212
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,479
like you know as regenerative Farmers

213
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,800
we're looking to do in most cases as

214
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,839
little disturbance as possible but you

215
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,879
weigh that realistically over time and

216
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,478
over the fact that you needed to be able

217
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,560
to get in your crops in order to make

218
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,478
the revenue to sustain the farm so

219
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,918
you're like all right well I I can

220
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:30,598
either do some you know careful

221
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:34,079
disturbance now and and then come right

222
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:36,319
behind it with a lot of healing or I can

223
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,278
wait and do it the slow way all by hand

224
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,919
and then potentially miss the season

225
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,519
which also will not be good for the farm

226
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,480
and so you you really Wade the type of

227
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,039
disturbance that you're going to do and

228
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,480
I think that Clarity is important well

229
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,159
and even in the long term like there's

230
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,839
the heavy-handed disturbance of of U

231
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,519
bringing Machinery onto the land but

232
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,360
then if you have say small diameter of

233
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,679
foot to 18in diameter trees and you

234
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,839
don't get the roots out you will be

235
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,599
coming back in with a chainsaw depending

236
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:11,519
on the species of trees and and burning

237
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,959
fuel and using oil again and again and

238
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:19,480
again um to keep that held back so it's

239
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:22,479
like uh you know more upfront and then

240
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,600
and then um the lack of disturbance or a

241
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,680
continuous disturbance to maintain that

242
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,959
project you know a lot I it you're your

243
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,199
experience of getting on the property

244
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,879
and then uh first off needing to uh get

245
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,399
a greenhouse going is that's a pretty

246
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,320
typical experience and um I've I've

247
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,839
talked to different farmers and and I

248
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,600
enjoy hearing um how they decided where

249
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,279
to place their greenhouse because on

250
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,639
some properties it's obvious right you

251
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,799
put it in the one place that gets the

252
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:57,559
most Sun but if if you've got things

253
00:09:53,799 --> 00:10:00,319
like you know um uh seasonal Sun changes

254
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,719
or or sun is available everywhere on the

255
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,519
property um there can be a lot of

256
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,160
competing um uh reasons to of placement

257
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,240
uh how did you come to the decision of

258
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,278
where to put your

259
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,079
Greenhouse uh well

260
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:19,399
um you know I would have loved to have

261
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,679
been on the land for 5 years before I

262
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,399
made any

263
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,239
infrastructure commitments you know to

264
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,839
to kind of see the pattern of things and

265
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,919
and one piece of advice I would give to

266
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,680
new homes

267
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,759
is really to to think about if you can

268
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:37,638
make infrastructure that's functional

269
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,600
but not permanent in the early part of

270
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,079
homesteading so like if you do put your

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,240
Greenhouse somewhere where it makes

272
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:46,559
sense when you first do it but then it

273
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,600
makes less sense as time goes on you can

274
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:54,359
take it apart and move it to somewhere

275
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,000
new um but yeah I I've seen a lot of of

276
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,759
Land Development especially around

277
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,759
cannabis growing make mistakes as far

278
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:06,439
as that that desire to get in your cash

279
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,600
crop in the first season makes you rush

280
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,760
and make kind of the decisions that you

281
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,839
can pull off rather than the decisions

282
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,799
you want to see in the long term um and

283
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,160
and there's no way around that to some

284
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:21,359
extent but um I I'm kind of wandering

285
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,919
off I forgot the the aim of the question

286
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,480
at first that's that's all right you

287
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,319
know I think that you make a good point

288
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,200
that the first step on the new parcel is

289
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,200
not to dig uh the first step on the new

290
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,600
parcel is to put down your chair in the

291
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,560
middle of the of the of the area and

292
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,839
look at it with notes and and and really

293
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:46,319
like think and dream and plan before you

294
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,079
dive into making things and um uh that

295
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
planning part you don't want to short

296
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,519
shrift because you know it kind of

297
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,599
reminds me of you know uh the whole

298
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,879
measure twice cut once idea EXA you

299
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,680
really don't want to build the

300
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,559
greenhouse and then have to move the

301
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,799
greenhouse in the same season it's

302
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,799
really better to spend a little bit of

303
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,919
time that you think you might be able to

304
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,399
might should be doing something else and

305
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,519
and really plan out what you're going to

306
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,519
do for the season there I I can't even

307
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,278
count the number of times I I've

308
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,759
confidently made a design or a decision

309
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,159
about something like irrigation ordered

310
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,000
a bunch of parts spent money put it all

311
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:27,278
together and then realized the areas

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,559
where it falls short yeah so a lot of

313
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:33,439
people um who are coming their property

314
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:36,759
also have got limited resources like you

315
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,360
did and um they really struggle I have

316
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,679
really struggled on the okay it's it's

317
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,919
my first season and I I need to get

318
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:48,638
going um I can either do a a fast and

319
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,479
cheap Greenhouse or I can build

320
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,198
something that I'll be proud of and will

321
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,600
last me a long time and and you know

322
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:56,679
perhaps I can go even later in the

323
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,759
season because if I get an uh an

324
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,838
unexpected snow I'll be able to handle

325
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:05,519
it you know how how did you weigh that

326
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,720
for yourself the the the wanting to not

327
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,879
waste resources but needing to get

328
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,920
something up but also not having the

329
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:15,278
resources to just throw money at it and

330
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,639
make something you know make a castle

331
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,278
Greenhouse right out of the bat well I

332
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,959
mean there's a bunch of approaches I I

333
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:25,039
was very fortunate in that I had access

334
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:28,439
to a woodmill so I made a wooden

335
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,759
Greenhouse um but since then various

336
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,360
approaches I

337
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,240
there's a lot available online of of

338
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,600
used uh materials you you can get on

339
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,560
Craigslist you can find um galvanized

340
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,600
conduit things like that you can get a a

341
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:47,000
conduit Bender to to make your own green

342
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,680
houses relatively inexpensively these

343
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,679
days um but the way my first Greenhouse

344
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:59,198
here I believe I found a a old pile of

345
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,958
used PVC at somebody's in somebody's

346
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,639
yard asked them if they were using it

347
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,758
and made a a quick PVC

348
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:09,120
hoop and it was the following year where

349
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,759
I had actually had time to f a tree and

350
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,560
Mill it and and build a greenhouse I

351
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,839
like this idea of not only upcycling

352
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,039
your materials in the short term because

353
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,240
that way you can feel a lot easier about

354
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,519
um building a temporary Greenhouse

355
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,720
immediately and then and then as you're

356
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,320
able to collect the higher quality um

357
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,560
materials do that the next season or or

358
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,360
further on um if you're if you're going

359
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,599
to do something short term um it's great

360
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,159
to be able to to get things from from

361
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,320
Neighbors or or shareed online so that

362
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,278
you don't have to spend that money and

363
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,240
you know and also create new plastic

364
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:47,799
right yeah and absolutely and maybe you

365
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,919
don't need a greenhouse the first year I

366
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:52,439
mean I did cuz I was hiding plants but

367
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:54,120
um if you don't use a greenhouse you

368
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,000
start your plants a little bit later it

369
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,679
gives you extra time to prepare your

370
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,078
your outdoor garden and and then you

371
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,599
plant that and you have a crop that you

372
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:07,278
can use towards building a greenhouse

373
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,879
the the following year I mean uh I I I

374
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,559
can give this advice it hasn't always

375
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:15,320
been advice I've taken myself um but to

376
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:18,319
to bite off what you can realistically

377
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,240
chew based on your your budget and your

378
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,160
your time Etc I mean I I have the bad

379
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,039
habit of jumping out of the airplane and

380
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,360
then imagining I can sew the parachute

381
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:32,039
before I hit the ground but um I I've I

382
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,919
can't say that it's always worked that

383
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,399
well well you know that I think that is

384
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,318
one of the challenges for those of us

385
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,240
who are like you know optimistic

386
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:43,078
Visionary type folks because um we we

387
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,278
we're always biting off more than we can

388
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:49,039
chew yeah yeah it it all looks so good

389
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:52,439
yeah so so let's talk about the the real

390
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:55,078
star of the farm your soil so um if I

391
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,639
understand the the story um when you got

392
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,359
to the farm it had not actually I mean

393
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,000
it wasn't even really a farm it was it

394
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,318
was a parcel and and the and the soil

395
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,198
had not been cared for in a long time um

396
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:09,360
you know most of us imagine that the

397
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,198
soil in Humble County is like you know

398
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,278
infused with magic and like good all by

399
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:17,359
itself was was your soil already good to

400
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,958
go when you arrived or did you know

401
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,959
immediately that you needed to do soil

402
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:25,318
building um it's actually a combination

403
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,879
because generally the the soil in Humble

404
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:32,120
County and around here is a very thin C

405
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:37,039
clay soil as as far as the top soil goes

406
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:40,600
and and here we have a vein of of really

407
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:43,240
quality soil in terms of of the soil

408
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,720
structure um the the place we are is

409
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,240
relatively flat and and it has a vein of

410
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,278
aluvial soil where where two Creeks had

411
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,440
come back and forth across and deposited

412
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:59,240
some soil so so it has a a slightly

413
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,560
Sandy lone strip through part of the

414
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:07,679
flat area here that being said it was

415
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:11,119
covered in Brush and was very acidic and

416
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:14,400
um it it needed a lot of work um so the

417
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:19,119
first order of business definitely was

418
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,600
testing that and adjusting the the pH to

419
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:25,000
to bring it back to to

420
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,318
neutral um and then as we expanded the

421
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,558
farm we reached out into more of of the

422
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:34,798
clay poor soil areas of the farm and and

423
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:37,519
started working on those soils so as you

424
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,839
um you know once you got the pH back to

425
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,558
neutral from all the all the acidity um

426
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:44,599
why don't you uh kind of illustrate for

427
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,038
us a couple of the processes that you

428
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:50,558
did to like build fertility into the

429
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:53,720
soil um because you know as we know it

430
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:57,839
takes more than just um you know a good

431
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,120
pH the the soil we want it um uh imbued

432
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,879
with with with microbes and beneficial

433
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,359
bacteria and fungi and and and I'm sure

434
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,360
that you were probably excited about

435
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,798
that part of it cuz because I mean it's

436
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,439
my favorite part because you get to do a

437
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,759
whole bunch of really cool living

438
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,159
projects you know so so why don't why

439
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,720
don't why don't you just kind of like uh

440
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,679
go through some of the the projects like

441
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,279
that that you did um to just increase

442
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,519
the the life force in the soil yeah

443
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,720
absolutely I mean I was relatively Lucky

444
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:32,480
in that generally unless soil is really

445
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,679
bare you you have a lot of Life Force in

446
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,919
it we we we have a forest soil here so

447
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:42,559
it is infused with life the the the

448
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,520
challenge here in Humble and in similar

449
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:49,480
Mediterranean climates is that it gets

450
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:52,038
so dry during the summer that it it it's

451
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,480
kind of like the winter would be if you

452
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:57,599
were in Michigan or something where the

453
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,839
the the season that that the life kind

454
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:03,279
of gets put on hold hold in in that most

455
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:06,839
active layer of the soil here is in the

456
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:10,038
summer because it dries out um so a big

457
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:13,359
part of that for me was developing the

458
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:16,440
organic matter so that it could hold

459
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:19,839
moisture a and there could be life there

460
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,080
throughout throughout the season so yeah

461
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:26,199
a a big part of it was was building a a

462
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:28,839
stable organic matter in the soil and

463
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,038
and stable organic matter is very

464
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,798
different than Act of breaking down

465
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,558
organic matter both of which you need

466
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,200
the act of breaking down organic matter

467
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,720
is the food for the biology in the soil

468
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,440
the stable organic matter I kind of

469
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,558
think of as the um the

470
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,240
housing it it's it's the buffer it's the

471
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:52,599
well that that you your plants can draw

472
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,919
from and the place the the pantry if you

473
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:57,719
will so that is a relatively slow

474
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,880
process one of the early ways I started

475
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,679
putting stable organic matter into the

476
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,799
soil and this is when I had a much

477
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,720
smaller Garden the farm didn't come

478
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:09,158
until until later was was through

479
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,519
biochar I was doing a lot of of burning

480
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,280
here on the property and learning how to

481
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,279
a as I did um fire safety work and

482
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:19,079
thinning in the forest learning how to

483
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:22,279
make burn piles um in a way that

484
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:25,678
preserved a lot of the charcoal then

485
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,319
soaking that in like a worm casting tea

486
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,600
and then putting that in the soil so

487
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:33,158
then you have this this repository of of

488
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:37,279
uh moisture holding and nutrient holding

489
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:40,840
within the soil and early on I was um

490
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,798
managing the soil with uh a biointensive

491
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,158
style rather than a no till style that's

492
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,639
where you like double dig everything all

493
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:51,880
the time which was incredibly tiring but

494
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,400
it also really allowed me to to build up

495
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,240
organic matter very very deep in the

496
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,080
soil um I hadn't heard of notil yet I

497
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,599
was I was really excited when I

498
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,119
discovered that about a decade later

499
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,199
you're like oh I'm already doing that

500
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,719
I'm like I I'm I I don't have to dig

501
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,600
everything every year and you know at

502
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,919
that point I I was digging with a shovel

503
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:15,000
and a fork to be able to do the same

504
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:19,759
kind of a thing of like keeping soil

505
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,200
structure while air rating um and and

506
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,158
discovering techniques to be able to do

507
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,080
that without as much work was was

508
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,600
mind-blowing to me I didn't understand

509
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,720
it when you first uh suggested that idea

510
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,199
now that I do that must have been a

511
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:36,960
really fabulous moment when you when you

512
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,960
read a you know a defense of not double

513
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,278
digging and realizing that that perhaps

514
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,200
it was time for that to end all that and

515
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:47,159
that's particularly backbreaking work

516
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,080
you must have felt like oh I'm free you

517
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,720
know yeah well I it it was amazing

518
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:55,519
because it kind of came with as we

519
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,960
expanded into being a larger Farm um

520
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,200
Taylor my my wife and I as as we

521
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,400
expanded in to a larger area here on the

522
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,519
property the the first thing we did was

523
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,840
like we well we obviously can't double

524
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,480
dig an acre so we're going we have a

525
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,439
tiller for our tractor we're going to

526
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,400
till and it just felt so wrong and then

527
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,720
we tilled and we were basically

528
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,278
gardening an acre and and we had this

529
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,480
awareness like this we can't Garden this

530
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:25,400
much we have to learn how to farm and

531
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,240
and farming is a different thing than

532
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,880
gardening a and how can we Farm in a way

533
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,599
that feels like we're taking care of the

534
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,159
soil and and we discovered various

535
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,519
literature about it and discovered

536
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,840
techniques to do that and and become

537
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:44,558
efficient at the same time as as

538
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,639
becoming better stewards of the the soil

539
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,200
this this idea that that farming is

540
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
different than gardening that's a very

541
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,960
provocative statement my my best

542
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,600
understanding of what you're saying

543
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,960
there would be that with with gardening

544
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,480
you're doing things that can be

545
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,679
inefficient because you're not scaled

546
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,480
but when you're scaled to a farm you

547
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,360
have to be far more efficient is that

548
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,240
what you mean by that yeah yeah exactly

549
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,759
um if you're farming um you know

550
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:16,240
unfortunately you're interacting with

551
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:18,440
with an economic reality where um you

552
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,319
can't lose money the way you can having

553
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,120
a hobby you know yeah you can have a

554
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:25,678
hobby where you spend $10 to make a

555
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:29,199
beautiful heirloom tomato for your

556
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,840
kitchen um that doesn't work if you're

557
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,679
if you're trying to to make a living

558
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:36,959
selling that tomato so um that's kind of

559
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,679
been the the constant challenge is how

560
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,919
how do you scale in a way that you can

561
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,559
provide food in a environmentally

562
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,919
friendly way in a way that leaves your

563
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:50,519
land in a better State than you found it

564
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,400
and at the same time is economically

565
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:57,359
viable um and and it is a kind of a

566
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,000
constant push and pull and and there's

567
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,678
there's no way to do it

568
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,839
perfect we we talk about being

569
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,720
regenerative but really when it comes to

570
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,079
it we're all of us striving towards this

571
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,319
idea of being

572
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:14,879
regenerative and and it's it's not

573
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:16,639
something that's easy you you can't um

574
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,919
in in permaculture we talk about a

575
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,120
closed loop system where where the

576
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,960
outputs of your farm become the inputs

577
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:27,759
of your farm and it's a self-sustaining

578
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,360
ecosystem well that that's a lot harder

579
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:33,519
when so much of the output of your farm

580
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:36,879
is leaving your farm never to be

581
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:39,119
returned so oh so so when you were um

582
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,640
you were describing how uh you were you

583
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:46,359
were um double dig digging until you

584
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,200
learned about no till because um you

585
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,558
know while while that's while that's an

586
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,120
you know an ancient process it's it's

587
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:56,440
relatively new to trending again I guess

588
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:59,079
I'll say um I can imagine that at the

589
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,960
beginning also you were probably doing

590
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,558
things that that we all know as

591
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,919
regenerative farming just because you

592
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,319
had low resources I I was talking with a

593
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,600
guy I never did get his name but um at a

594
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,839
uh at a golden tarp several years ago

595
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,719
and he said he says he says oh I I've

596
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:17,119
been regenerative farmer my whole life

597
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,159
but when I was young we just called it

598
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,079
being poor and and because like he was

599
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:27,000
focused on using the materials that are

600
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,879
on the property um and and because he he

601
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,119
he couldn't afford you know the the

602
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,159
fertilizers that you'd get from town in

603
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,079
the same way I want to ask you like you

604
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:39,080
know you you described how you wanted to

605
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,599
both increase the microbe life but then

606
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:44,158
also increase the you know what we're

607
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,839
going to call housing or structure that

608
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,799
um that protects and gives

609
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:53,359
um place for those microbes to

610
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,720
to I want to use the word procreate but

611
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,000
that's not scientifically accurate but

612
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,720
make more incubate them and so what what

613
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,798
were some of the natural inputs that you

614
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,798
found um you know on the parcel or

615
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,158
nearby that you could Wildcraft and put

616
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,359
to work in your soil building it well

617
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,440
early on in building the soil I didn't

618
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,398
really have the awareness of of

619
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,000
wildcrafting input so I think that kind

620
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:25,599
of the the jadam knf kind of

621
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,319
input um awareness came came to us maybe

622
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:32,199
10 years ago um early on

623
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:34,960
I had a lot of wood a lot of wood chips

624
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,360
uh I wasn't doing hugle building with

625
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,360
with large wood partly because I I had

626
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:44,558
really nice soil and I didn't feel like

627
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:47,278
I needed to to put wood in the the lower

628
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,720
profile of it to make that work but what

629
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:49,720
what I did have is a lot of wood chips

630
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,919
for doing

631
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:57,919
mulching um and although I didn't have

632
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,360
animals myself early on besides um

633
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,759
chicken for eggs and that manure went

634
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:06,879
back onto the farm um I did have friends

635
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,200
and neighbors who had cows and horses

636
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,278
and and goats and was able to put a lot

637
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,558
of organic matter in the form of manure

638
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:18,359
and wood chips from from the area onto

639
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:22,000
the soil and I mean that that really is

640
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:24,158
like the input you want is is organic

641
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,079
matter especially in a place like

642
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,840
Humbolt the flip side of of what we were

643
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,480
talking about earlier about the the dry

644
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,879
SE and being a time when when microbes

645
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,519
kind of go dormant if if the soil isn't

646
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,679
kept moist and there's not good moisture

647
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:42,079
holding capacity the flip side of it is

648
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:45,679
the wet season here is is 80 plus inches

649
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:49,278
of rain during during the year so if you

650
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,600
don't hold those nutrients somehow they

651
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,960
they wash out all all of the soluble

652
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,759
nutrients so some of the biggest issues

653
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,880
for us over the years have always been

654
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:02,440
like how do we create nitrogen how do we

655
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:06,799
hold nitrogen how do we find sulfur how

656
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:09,120
do we hold sulfur um uh and some of of

657
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,278
the micronutrients and minerals things

658
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,439
that wash out of the soil here just

659
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:17,480
aren't there unless you find ways to put

660
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,080
them in and to hold them um and the over

661
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,200
the course of gardening here the single

662
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:26,798
largest way that we've found to build

663
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,399
soil is is through wintertime cover

664
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:33,639
cropping and and it's it it just is

665
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:35,439
incredible how much soil you can build

666
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,480
because the winter here when we're not

667
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,200
able to grow crops is is four to six

668
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,759
months of the year so you you're

669
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,399
actually growing a full crop during that

670
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:49,398
wintertime season entirely just to put

671
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,398
back into the soil and once you start

672
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:54,359
doing the the noil version of it you're

673
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:56,759
you're not just putting it back on the

674
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,558
top but all of the roots of those cover

675
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,398
crops get to stay where they are in the

676
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:03,599
Pathways in the soil that they've opened

677
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:07,439
up that becomes a porous structure of

678
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:11,719
the soil and and the exits of the roots

679
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,480
help create kind of a a glue that glues

680
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,038
the soil structure together and then

681
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,960
makes a a porous environment so if you

682
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,960
take a cover crop and you lay the the

683
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,919
the green matter on the top and let that

684
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,319
decompose naturally into the top of the

685
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:30,278
soil and let the roots decompose down in

686
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:33,480
the subsoil and in in in the soil deeper

687
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,839
where they are you really quickly build

688
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,240
organic matter deep into the soil that

689
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,558
was a beautiful explanation Daniel that

690
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,120
topnotch yeah I mean like the the engine

691
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:45,720
for all of it right the engine for

692
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,239
organic matter is photosynthesis and and

693
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,079
to you need to take advantage of the

694
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,759
photosynthesis potential on your garden

695
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,398
soil all the time and it's either you're

696
00:29:54,759 --> 00:30:00,278
you're taking photosynthesis from

697
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:02,639
another area in the form of straw or hay

698
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,440
or wood chips or even animal manure from

699
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,360
animals that have eaten that and

700
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,798
bringing it to you or you're or and

701
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:14,319
really not or you're creating

702
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,918
photosynthesis in place and that the the

703
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,158
lovely thing about that is it's so

704
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,919
simple it's there you're not

705
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:21,679
wheelbarrowing it you're not moving it

706
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,600
around and you can have it um be

707
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,600
nitrogen fixing so that it it also

708
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:30,079
creates um creates fertility that's

709
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,119
great so so um I want to hit one more

710
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,398
topic or it's actually the same topic

711
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:35,079
but I want to ask you one more question

712
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:38,199
before we go to the first commercial

713
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:41,278
which is um you know the what the

714
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,679
specific over winter cover crop is going

715
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,398
to be um is going to be different

716
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,080
depending on what part of the country

717
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:48,798
that we live in so so everybody's going

718
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,960
to have their own local plant that tends

719
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:54,558
to work best for them what I'm curious

720
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,440
to hear you speak to is is number one um

721
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:59,960
did you choose one cover crop and go

722
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,840
sold with that ever or did you pick a

723
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,880
few different cover crops and and plant

724
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:09,278
them together for variety and two how

725
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,360
does that crop cover crop fit

726
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:14,200
into like all of the plants that are on

727
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:15,519
your property so on your property I'm

728
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,960
assuming that you're going to have these

729
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,200
these seasonal cover crops but then also

730
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,960
you're going to have um uh uh the food

731
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,200
that you're grow growing for market and

732
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,159
then you've got the Cannabis probably in

733
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,600
the greenhouse and outside of it and

734
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,480
then you've got your ornamentals that

735
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,678
you just grow around your property for

736
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,120
fun we we all know as regenerative

737
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:35,600
Farmers that these plants are all

738
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:37,918
interacting with each other at a

739
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,918
biological level even even if they're

740
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,278
not planted right next to each other I'd

741
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,240
like to kind of like he hear about like

742
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:46,319
what was the melody for the different

743
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,079
types of plants that you chose for the

744
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:51,558
farm um as as you settled in and figured

745
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:56,079
out what was going to be best for the

746
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:58,798
farm um I mean we have a a number of

747
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,960
different management strategies that we

748
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,359
have developed and are developing and

749
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,679
will will change over time for for

750
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,759
different goals um how we manage beds

751
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,000
for cannabis is very different than how

752
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:13,079
we manage beds for lettuce and you know

753
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,480
the big factors are the crop that you're

754
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:19,678
growing is it a quick turnaround does it

755
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,000
suffer from from competition from Weeds

756
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,038
or does it do fine with that and and

757
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,398
again like we you just said how does it

758
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:30,960
interact with the plants around it so uh

759
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,158
in our perennial gardens we just do a

760
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,000
lot of deep mulch we have a variety of

761
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:38,760
plants both for for beauty that we like

762
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,558
for medicinal use for ourselves for

763
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,879
beneficial insects um and then the the

764
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,079
Cannabis is kind of somewhere in between

765
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,200
a perennial garden and an annual Garden

766
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:51,158
cannabis is such a long-lived annual it

767
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,759
it really plays well with

768
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,480
perennials um and and the way we manage

769
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:59,240
that tends to be an in between where we

770
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,000
we grow grow a cover crop but we manage

771
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,679
it through crimping and Mulch and and

772
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,720
the edge of the Cannabis beds has has a

773
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,720
a perennial garden of sorts and and that

774
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,519
Garden tends to entirely be

775
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,919
beneficials um for insects that are

776
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,480
Predator insects for cannabis or trap

777
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,000
crops or or things like that um and then

778
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,639
the annual vegetable production

779
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,599
depending on the crop that's going to be

780
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:29,199
in an area gets a different management

781
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:31,398
technique and and needs longer to

782
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,319
transition from the wintertime cover

783
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:39,359
crop to being a a very clean blank bare

784
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:42,398
slate bed that we can use Cedars or or

785
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,199
transplanting tools on and what I've

786
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:47,000
really found that I like in terms of

787
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,960
cover crop is doing a cover crop mix and

788
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,480
you can find a mix that that works for

789
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,000
your environment and works for your

790
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,558
needs but but we actually buy a premixed

791
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,240
cover crop that is a combination of of

792
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:03,000
uh fava

793
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:06,440
uh vet peas and oats and and what I like

794
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,760
about that is is there's an inherent

795
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,200
intelligence to to plants and their

796
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,639
interaction with their environment and

797
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:17,078
and

798
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:19,519
um you find different expressions of

799
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,280
what germinates and what thrives in

800
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:24,559
different beds in beds that tend to be

801
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,280
low in nitrogen after a year of growing

802
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,279
the crop you've had on it the the

803
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,119
legumes in that cover crop mix really

804
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,320
thrive in beds that have a lot of

805
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,800
nitrogen the the grass really thrives

806
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,039
and it's able to grow a lot before the

807
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,440
heaviness of the winter rains comes and

808
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,358
and hold a lot of that nutrient in its

809
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,599
in its structure versus the legumes

810
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,960
which are building building nutrient

811
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,720
through um its relationship in in its

812
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,320
roots um so so having a mix of cover

813
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,879
crop really helps it thrive in whichever

814
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,680
environment you put it in and that

815
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,280
changes year to year it's not something

816
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,279
I've been able to wrap my head around

817
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,640
predicting what will do well in which

818
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,720
area at which time um the one aspect

819
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,679
we're starting to discover in in the

820
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:15,719
Cannabis zones especially where we use

821
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:20,159
crimping as a technique to integrate

822
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:22,159
cover crop is that the there's a benefit

823
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,279
if you're if you're using crimping as a

824
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:28,559
technique to having cover crops that

825
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:31,200
come into flour at the same time cuz

826
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,239
um crimping as a technique really

827
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,358
depends on timing if if you crimp while

828
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,759
a plant is in its most vigorous growth

829
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:41,078
time it's going to grow right through

830
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,320
that push its way through the mulch you

831
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:47,000
put on top of it and continue growing

832
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,160
versus if you cover crop um right when a

833
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,480
plant's putting all of its energy into

834
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:55,960
flowering but hasn't produced seeds yet

835
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,480
it tends to actually be killed by the

836
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,119
crimping technique and start its

837
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,480
decomposition process and so the cover

838
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,119
crop mix we've been using which we've

839
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,318
still used this

840
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:15,358
season the the oats flour at a later

841
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:18,358
time than than the vetch and the um the

842
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,199
fava beans so the oats continue to grow

843
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:22,799
or if I were to wait for the oats to

844
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:26,679
flour the the fava and the vet will have

845
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,240
already seeded and that could be a

846
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:32,559
benefit and and I know farmers who are

847
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:36,399
effectively using already seeded cover

848
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:38,679
crop and dry farming somewhat so they I

849
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,838
if you're aren't overhead watering say

850
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:43,879
if you have your irrigation under where

851
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,119
you crimp your cover crop so that after

852
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,640
you do your cover crop it it it kind of

853
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:51,559
dries out and becomes mulch you can have

854
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:54,358
a fully seeded cover crop let it dry out

855
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:57,599
and become mulch your irrigation lines

856
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:59,799
are under it and then when you get fall

857
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,838
r that causes that to germinate again

858
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,000
and you're already planted in cover crop

859
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:07,199
oh that's nice yeah and that's that's

860
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,719
theoretical I've heard um some some

861
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,759
really amazing Farmers talk about that

862
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,318
um but I have not tried that you really

863
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,040
got to nail you really got to nail that

864
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:18,920
time just got to nail that you know and

865
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,559
and and getting it to reced and and all

866
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,559
of that it's something I'd love to

867
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,480
experiment with at some point but but

868
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,719
haven't gotten to yet as it is I'm now

869
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:32,079
looking for an early earlier

870
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:35,318
flowering um grain grass that I can mix

871
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,000
in with with my my VCH and and my fava

872
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:39,079
beans to have them at least come into

873
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,838
fruition at the same time for Effective

874
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:44,000
crimping you know one thing that is

875
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:46,519
underlying this this um this philosophy

876
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,639
that you just shared is that when you're

877
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,280
when you're just establishing your farm

878
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,480
is regenerative whether or not you just

879
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,519
got the parcel or if you're switching

880
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,519
from petroleum farming to regenerative

881
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:59,000
farming um sometimes the first few years

882
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,239
as you're getting your legs under you

883
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,960
it's it's okay to use the same kind of

884
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,118
like off-the-shelf like uh cover crop

885
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,519
mixes and other other things where where

886
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,760
you don't have to reinvent the wheel

887
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:14,079
like you don't AB you don't have to be

888
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,079
inventing all new farming techniques

889
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,280
your first couple years there's reasons

890
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,560
why um these some of these seed mixes

891
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,640
and and other tools are you know are

892
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,759
things that everybody uses and and so

893
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,559
just you know go ahead and follow the

894
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,160
crowd on some of this stuff until you

895
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:32,318
get established and you can really uh

896
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,519
fine-tune it for your own particular

897
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:36,239
parcel well and it and it goes back to

898
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,440
that biting off more than you can chew I

899
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:42,239
mean I I often still use cover crop

900
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,920
mixes because I don't have the time to

901
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,719
wrap my head around every aspect of the

902
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,800
farm and farmers are doing it especially

903
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:53,480
now there's so many small farms out

904
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,519
there there there is so much thought

905
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,760
being put into this and therefore there

906
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,519
are a lot of products out there that are

907
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,200
made by Farmers with the thought of of

908
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:05,079
helping farmers and especially like in

909
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:07,519
the tool realm and and things like that

910
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:10,200
that there's a lot available you don't

911
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:13,440
need to do it all yourself you couldn't

912
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:15,318
even if you tried and and part of

913
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,639
learning to farm was learning to focus

914
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:20,559
on what we're good at and and to let

915
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,639
other people do what they're good at and

916
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,039
be collaborative about it right on

917
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,318
that's good those are good words of

918
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,920
advice so all right so let's take a

919
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:29,679
short break and be right back you're

920
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,599
listening to shaping fire and my guest

921
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,159
today is regenerative farmer Daniel

922

Stein and you know without these

923
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,559
advertisers shaping fire would not

924
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,139
happen so please support them and let

927
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,959
fire revenue is tight for cannabis

928
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,920
businesses right now there is no

929
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,000
question about it and when Revenue

930
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,559
tightens businesses need to spend

931

Smarter on Advertising instead of

932
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,400
throwing obscene money at Hanging your

company's logo from the rafters at your

934
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,559
next convention perhaps consider placing

935
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,640
commercials on shaping fire and if you

936
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,559
are a very small business there is

937
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,078
simply no better bang for your buck than

people who own companies know that

947
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:26,759

and mirrors nowadays I find that people

956

984
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,519
extraordinarily complex not only are you

985
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,119
adding the nitrogen phosphorus and

986
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,000

mass transport nutrients enhance flavor

988
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,079
but fish waste is also packed with

989
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,880
biological activity and micronutrients

990
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,160
when you add fish poop to your

991
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,480

force probiotics and active microbes

993
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,519
these microorganisms include a wealth of

994
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,639
various bacteria and protozoa which

995
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,358
further enhance nutrient availability

996
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:16,719
for the plants because plants are

997
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:19,039
limited by the absence of any essential

998
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,759
micronutrient these Trace nutrients are

999
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,440
the difference between having a decent

1000
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,960

shaping fire I'm your host Shango Los

1085
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:42,280
and my guest today is regenerative

1086
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:44,358
farmer Daniel Stein so before the break

1087
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,680
we were talking about the the initial

1088
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:49,358
things to do or at least considerations

1089
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:50,960
as you are uh setting up your farm to

1090
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,239
become regenerative rather or not

1091
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,639
whether you are a post petroleum or if

1092
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:57,199
it's just your first time on the

1093
00:45:54,639 --> 00:46:00,480
property now one of the things that

1094
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,118
Daniel hit on was that um you know if

1095
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,000
you're building up all this soil you

1096
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:05,838
don't want it all to get washed away and

1097
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,400
so that's what we're going to start with

1098
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:10,599
Daniel you know water retention is

1099
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,160
really important you know across the

1100
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:15,440
country but especially where you live

1101
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:19,639
because you like I we have this this

1102
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,639
drought portion of the summer and um and

1103
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:24,078
there's lots of there's lots of laws

1104
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:26,558
rurally about what you can and can't do

1105
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,400
with water and if you find yourself

1106
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,880
without out water and you're far out

1107
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,680
like you are off grid it's not like you

1108
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,519
can just turn on the faucet and then

1109
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,239
suddenly there it is um absolutely and

1110
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:40,119
you also mentioned that um you know not

1111
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:43,000
only do you want to retain the water but

1112
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:45,599
you also need to control the flow of

1113
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,358
water so that the water doesn't take

1114
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,359
away all the nutrients that you're

1115
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:53,000
putting in all this effort building into

1116
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:55,078
the soil so I'd like you to talk through

1117
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,639
um yeah let's you know for certain use

1118
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,559
your property as example but I'd like

1119
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,920
you to talk about it more theoretically

1120
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:05,640
so it so it applies to many people's

1121
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,440
Farms talk about water retention meaning

1122
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:09,799
how how you can sequester the water on

1123
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,960
your property strategies to do that so

1124
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:15,839
the water stays and then second how you

1125
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,079
control the flow so that it doesn't wash

1126
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,039
all the good hard work you've done

1127
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:23,359
away yeah well there there's a number of

1128
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:26,318
strategies and it really depends on on

1129
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:29,440
your individual situation needs and and

1130
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:33,719
what your go for for your farm I mean

1131
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:37,039
the answer to so many of of the issues

1132
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:40,239
is organic matter organic matter is how

1133
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,318
you can hold water like a sponge it's

1134
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:45,838
how you can hold nutrients it's how you

1135
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:50,039
can you can buffer High rainfall High

1136
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:53,480
Water Events um it it's it's the answer

1137
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:58,400
to so much when it comes to to farming

1138
00:47:53,480 --> 00:48:01,119
um and then in in terms of of water flow

1139
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,519
if you're trying if your site doesn't

1140
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,160
get enough water retention throughout

1141
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:10,519
the season the main thing you want to do

1142
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:14,679
is is get more water to

1143
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:16,400
it and and so doing things like swales

1144
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:18,480
where where you slow down the water

1145
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,800
coming across your property and get it

1146
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,639
to go into into your system help that

1147
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,400
and that's in in my environment that's

1148
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:29,719
not something I've ever really had to do

1149
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,039
with a in of rain everything that can

1150
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:34,199
get saturated gets saturated without the

1151
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,719
help of bringing more water into it and

1152
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:38,239
as a matter of fact doing swales is is

1153
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,239
something you have to be careful about

1154
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:43,078
because if you super saturate areas you

1155
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:46,439
can deal with with landslides if it's in

1156
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:48,599
the wrong wrong kind of an area um we do

1157
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,599
use some of those techniques less about

1158
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:52,440
retaining water and more about slowing

1159
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:54,400
water down in areas that we have

1160
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,358
plantings that can uptake some of those

1161
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,798
nutrients that that would flow out with

1162
00:48:56,358 --> 00:49:00,039
water

1163
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:03,000
um so low on our property we have some

1164
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:04,798
swes that are are planted in in comrey

1165
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,119
and other things that are deep rooted so

1166
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:09,119
it can slow any water down and and we

1167
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,960
can hopefully remove a lot of the

1168
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,400
nutrients that would be flowing out with

1169
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,119
that water and turn them back into plant

1170
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,519
material that we can Harvest and bring

1171
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:22,480
up to to the top of the system again uh

1172
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:25,079
but it definitely is organic matter

1173
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,519
organic matter is the sponge it it

1174
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:31,920
reduces water speed flowing through

1175
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:36,519
sandy soil it increases the drainage

1176
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:39,318
capacity of clay soil it it brings

1177
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:40,960
everything into balance I believe this

1178
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:42,400
next question you just answered and it's

1179
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,079
going to be organic material but I'm

1180
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,160
going to ask it anyway because a lot of

1181
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,480
people run into it you know a lot of

1182
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:48,679
parts of the country and and it's

1183
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,000
probably even going to become more

1184
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:53,399
common to have a drought period during

1185
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,079
the summer and when that happens you

1186
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,240
know the the top soil gets um you know

1187
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,519
Dusty and and in many places it getss

1188
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:05,519
hydrophobic so that when the rain does

1189
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:08,318
start um it doesn't immediately go into

1190
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:11,000
the into the top soil and it and it runs

1191
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:13,239
and and so people really rely on on

1192
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,079
these uh permaculture Solutions like

1193
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:20,399
swales um to to guide it and to and to

1194
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:23,240
also slow it down do you find like the

1195
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,639
question is what do you what strategy do

1196
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:31,558
you most like to uh fight the like hood

1197
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:34,960
of um hydrophobic soil so that when the

1198
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:38,400
rains first start for the year um you

1199
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:43,000
don't lose a lot of important soil and

1200
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:46,798
soil chemistry before the soil opens

1201
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,480
up well mulch being kind of the best

1202
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:51,719
when it when it's something that you can

1203
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,760
work with like if if you're in a

1204
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,798
cropping system where you can do a heavy

1205
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,799
mulch if you can afford to either bring

1206
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:02,400
a quality straw on or use wood chips for

1207
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:06,639
mulch that will break up the water it'll

1208
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,240
slow it down um that works for much of

1209
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:12,039
our farm for a lot of the the vegetable

1210
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:15,039
side of it you know we you can't mulch

1211
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:16,798
around radishes that are in the ground

1212
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:19,400
for four weeks and then pull the mulch

1213
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:22,199
and replant each time so we do have a

1214
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,720
lot of beds that that end up being

1215
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:26,279
relatively bare soil even though there

1216
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,879
there's cover crop planted in them that

1217
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,000
will sprout quickly after the first

1218
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:33,240
rains uh one of the main things we do

1219
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,679
for that where we don't we don't have

1220
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:36,598
control of it through something on the

1221
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:40,960
surface of the soil is making sure that

1222
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:44,039
all of our beds are on Contour so in a

1223
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,599
way they act like swales so our beds are

1224
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:49,639
on contour and even though we don't have

1225
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,440
much of a slope um the they're on

1226
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,480
contour and they're slightly raised

1227
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,960
above the pathways so that if we do lose

1228
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,318
any soil from erosion it goes into the

1229
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,400
pathways

1230
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:04,440
and then every couple years we we come

1231
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,960
through and we put the the the soil and

1232
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,400
and broken down wood chip mulch and

1233
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,039
various things that have built up in the

1234
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:15,079
pathways back on top of the beds and it

1235
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:16,880
acts like a a another kind of a boost it

1236
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:21,119
it's like putting compost on top of the

1237
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:24,240
beds MH so earlier you mentioned uh trap

1238
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,720
plants and um uh in addition to that and

1239
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,719
and and perhaps you can explain the kind

1240
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:29,759
of trap plants that you like um how do

1241
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:32,318
you manage pests on your

1242
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,040
property um well different pests

1243
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,079
different ways I

1244
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:40,279
mean there there are pests that we can

1245
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:42,280
manage effectively through encouraging

1246
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,760
the Natural Balance and then there are

1247
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,440
pests that come out of balance um pests

1248
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,040
that we can deal with

1249
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:55,119
effectively through the Natural Balance

1250
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:57,719
we we encourage uh plants that are are

1251
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:01,079
uh an ecosystem an environment that

1252
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:03,798
encourages natural predators and often

1253
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:05,599
for us those are are umbles things like

1254
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:09,400
Queen Ann's lace

1255
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:11,760
sisum um various flowers um one thing

1256
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:14,519
that I I a lot of people don't don't

1257
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:18,760
realize is that

1258
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:20,838
the the stage of of much of many of the

1259
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,880
Predators that attack pest say if it's

1260
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:25,119
aphids or thrips or something like that

1261
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,640
a lot of the Predators that attack those

1262
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:32,720
pests are the larval stage of of the

1263
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:34,598
predator and that the adult stage that

1264
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,078
you need to have around in order to lay

1265
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:40,480
the eggs in the right place to have the

1266
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,359
larval stage eat nectar and pollen from

1267
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,679
specific plants so so when you talk

1268
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:46,119
about beneficial plants it's all often

1269
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,798
you're providing the food in the

1270
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:52,119
environment for the adult stage of of a

1271
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:55,480
beneficial insect that will then go lay

1272
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:57,599
its eggs in aphid bodies or lay larvae

1273
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:02,480
that then crawl around on the plant and

1274
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:05,280
and eat thrips um things like that um

1275
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,119
the the Trap crops are are interesting

1276
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,160
because the idea of a trap crop is

1277
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:14,480
having having a plant that your pests

1278
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:16,639
desire more than your cash crop and one

1279
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,159
of the main ones we use in our cannabis

1280
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:23,798
is is actually catnip works really well

1281
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:27,118
for mites mites seem to prefer catnip

1282
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:28,920
over cannabis any day of the week and

1283
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,280
and it provides an environment so if we

1284
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,960
do have something out of balance we can

1285
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,760
if we're using beneficial insects we can

1286
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:41,240
release the beneficial insects into the

1287
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,359
Trap crop where there's a a large

1288
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:46,919
population

1289
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:48,239
of of the pest and they can eat the pest

1290
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,358
they can breed and then they can Branch

1291
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:53,679
out from there where I if you're if

1292
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,719
you're buying an expensive beneficial

1293
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,440
insect and putting it on say a cannabis

1294
00:54:55,719 --> 00:55:00,558
plant that has

1295
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,119
a a smattering of a pest not not to an

1296
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,960
epidemic proportion you're wasting a lot

1297
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,880
of a lot of that insect they'll they'll

1298
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,280
mostly die off of starvation if they

1299
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,960
can't find their

1300
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:16,079
food I I like this idea and that is

1301
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,519
common in regenerative agriculture that

1302
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:22,440
that these pests are usually coming

1303
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:24,960
because the garden is uh out of balance

1304
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:28,200
and it's it swings one way or another

1305
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,679
too dry too wet to to to whatever and

1306
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:33,519
and and when it's out of balance it

1307
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:36,798
creates opportunities for certain pests

1308
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:38,719
to expand and then you've got a problem

1309
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,400
and um I think it's really fun because

1310
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,838
when I tour regenerative Farms there's

1311
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,798
there's just such a diversity of plants

1312
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:47,838
right it's it's it's it's the complete

1313
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:48,960
opposite of a monoculture yeah of course

1314
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:51,038
we've got we've got these you know

1315
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,838
fields of cannabis but then you've got

1316
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,240
you know you know all these smaller

1317
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:57,798
plants and then and then cover crops and

1318
00:55:55,239 --> 00:56:01,358
then uh ornamentals that are just pretty

1319
00:55:57,798 --> 00:56:03,119
for the farm and and they're all growing

1320
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,639
and then in the summer which is normally

1321
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,119
when I do my tours they're all flowering

1322
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:12,000
and gorgeous and they smell good and you

1323
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:14,838
can you can feel the balance of the farm

1324
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,199
and and I I think that the the number

1325
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:22,159
one solution for pests on regenerative

1326
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,239
Farms is just to grow a lot and a lot of

1327
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:26,920
variety because I certainly have got

1328
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:29,239
great uh results from adding beneficial

1329
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,159
insects as well but but you're you're

1330
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:34,199
speaking the truth man when you when you

1331
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:36,440
say that if if you if you're if your

1332
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:38,798
garden isn't already out of balance

1333
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:42,159
there might not be enough food for the

1334
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:44,038
beneficial insects to keep them going

1335
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:47,879
and so it's really going to be better

1336
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:51,119
for you to instead of of spot trying to

1337
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,599
fix a problem really focus on the

1338
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,720
biological diversity and the flowering

1339
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:59,280
and plant diversity so that um the

1340
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:01,558
plants that you want they choose to come

1341
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,480
to your farm and they choose to do their

1342
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:07,440
life cycle on your farm and then you can

1343
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,039
save some money on the Biologicals like

1344
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,280
beneficial insects um for when you

1345
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:16,039
actually have a problem and and you need

1346
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:20,280
some first aid yeah and abs absolutely

1347
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:24,440
and even even there within that our farm

1348
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:27,280
isn't an island it it is in a greater

1349
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:30,400
environment and so as we've seen more

1350
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,519
proliferation of large cannabis Farms as

1351
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,599
we've had to move towards using clones

1352
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:40,440
things like that more more pests become

1353
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:44,798
an issue like the the hemp aphid did not

1354
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:47,159
exist for us in any way many years ago

1355
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:49,358
and never would have if we didn't have

1356
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:53,798
some large cannabis farms in our area

1357
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:56,519
that proliferated them um and that that

1358
00:57:53,798 --> 00:58:01,079
particular pest poses a unique problem

1359
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:04,318
because our the way our environment will

1360
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:06,079
is bringing that pest into balance is

1361
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:10,239
through a number of predators but one of

1362
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:12,480
the primary ones is the surfed fly uh or

1363
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:14,038
hoverfly and they're those little things

1364
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,679
that kind of look like bees but they're

1365
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,920
shaped like flies if you've ever seen

1366
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:22,239
them for sure and and they're

1367
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:24,280
wonderful the the issue is the the hemp

1368
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:27,000
Aid comes late in the season during

1369
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,480
budding often or early budding

1370
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,719
and the surfit Flies follow them and the

1371
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,199
way the surfit

1372
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:39,199
fly um feeds on on the aphid is by by

1373
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:43,038
laying eggs which hatch and develop into

1374
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:44,759
larvae which then crawl around and or

1375
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,839
squirm around they kind of look like

1376
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,960
maggots and and eat aphids and aphid

1377
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:53,239
eggs now the issue with that is it is

1378
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,079
bringing it into balance and it is

1379
00:58:53,239 --> 00:59:00,078
getting rid of the aphids often times

1380
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:02,760
there's no aphids left in on on Plants

1381
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:08,240
where where the surfit flies have worked

1382
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:11,839
but they also leave eggs and larvae

1383
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:15,318
inside of buds so the the most extreme

1384
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:19,440
version of this is um a number of years

1385
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:22,599
ago um I knew of a jar brand and and the

1386
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,200
the surfit fly larvae will remain

1387
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:27,760
dormant at certain temperatures but then

1388
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:31,199
develop at room temperature over the

1389
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,880
course of two weeks so there was a a

1390
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:38,078
Jarred brand that that had organic

1391
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,720
regenerative cannabis in it and because

1392
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,359
it was organic and there were aphids

1393
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:44,239
there was Surfin fly larvae that had

1394
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:46,598
once it was put on the Shelf in the

1395
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,639
dispensary at room temperature had

1396
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:53,079
hatched and become flies inside of the

1397
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:54,960
jar oh makes for bad branding yeah

1398
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:58,280
that's a really bad brand experience for

1399
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,480
sure so that that particular balance

1400
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,000
does not work for us we

1401
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,000
can't

1402
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,880
encourage surfed flies as the answer for

1403
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,838
aphids even though our natural

1404
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:13,680
environment wants that to be the

1405
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:15,440
balance um so we do have to work with

1406
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:18,279
with beneficial insects to control the

1407
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:22,119
aphids early on so that we don't have

1408
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:24,559
what is essentially a beneficial insect

1409
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,119
um hurt the the quality of our flower

1410
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,240
down the line wow that's really

1411
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:31,798
thoughtful um not only so so the so the

1412
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:34,798
aphids are the original Pest and the

1413
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:37,280
surfit Flies are the original beneficial

1414
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:39,599
but due to the nature of the surfit

1415
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,160
Flies the surfit Flies actually becomes

1416
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,519
a pest because of their larvae in the

1417
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:47,879
flowers and so actually you need a

1418
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:50,079
thirdparty outside beneficial insect

1419
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,680
that will take out the aphids before the

1420
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,798
aphids get so significant that they

1421
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:58,159
attract the surfit Flies yeah and so we

1422
01:00:54,798 --> 01:01:01,318
do introduce Green Lace Wing which are

1423
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:04,078
natural here but never seem to build up

1424
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:07,920
enough of a natural population fast

1425
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:10,640
enough to deal with the the hemp aphid

1426
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,200
which doesn't exist here naturally along

1427
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:15,759
with cannabis which also doesn't exist

1428
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:17,759
here naturally so it makes sense that

1429
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,960
that it it is sometimes hard for the

1430
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:24,960
natural system to come into balance with

1431
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:27,679
these essentially exotic plants um they

1432
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,519
the the the lace Wing isn't able to

1433
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,159
build up a population quick enough to

1434
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,880
deal with just the incredibly rapid rate

1435
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:40,159
at which um hemp AIDS

1436
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:42,599
proliferate wow so um and hemp bavid do

1437
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,798
like there's it comes to variety there

1438
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:47,519
there's there's strains that they seem

1439
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:49,000
to like no matter how healthy they are

1440
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:51,199
that there's something about them they

1441
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,519
like and they're strange they don't seem

1442
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:57,679
to like and and not

1443
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:59,759
all often times it is there is an

1444
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:02,318
imbalance in the farm that causes a pest

1445
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:06,319
to to like something but there there's

1446
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:10,119
often times pests that that do really

1447
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:11,558
well uh um attacking plants and and it

1448
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:13,278
might not be that the plants out of

1449
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:15,319
balance it might just be that that plant

1450
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:18,079
has not developed with a resistance to

1451
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:20,558
that particular pest because they known

1452
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,880
each other long enough I that makes

1453
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:25,359
sense especially with you know some of

1454
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,200
these uh the the the newer strains that

1455
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:30,239
that that are like a far cry away from

1456
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:33,038
uh land races sometimes sometimes they

1457
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,399
just so they just don't have that depth

1458
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,640
of uh of genetic protection no they've

1459
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:40,480
they've never seen the sun even much l

1460
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:44,440
they've never been outside of indoor

1461
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:48,119
yeah um so let's let's uh shift gears to

1462
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:51,920
um uh to animals on the property um so

1463
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:54,480
far uh you have mentioned uh chickens as

1464
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,278
far as animal husbandry goes and and

1465
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,559
using uh manure from Neighbors Farms but

1466
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:02,039
that that was way in the beginning so so

1467
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:04,000
so now that you are more established

1468
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:06,400
perhaps you have other animals too but

1469
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,079
but whether whether the animals are

1470
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,278
yours or whether you're bringing them

1471
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:15,359
from elsewhere um speak a little bit if

1472
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:17,760
you would to um how uh animal um inputs

1473
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:20,639
if you will uh whether it's their manure

1474
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,039
or their their their body uh how how

1475
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:26,159
those are being incorporated into the

1476
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:28,480
cycle on your farm yeah absolutely well

1477
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:31,480
I mean number one it's the the

1478
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:35,000
relationship with humans and animals and

1479
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:38,039
farming it all kind of evolve together

1480
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,960
right and the the way I see it is

1481
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:44,240
animals have developed incredible

1482
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:48,159
microbiomes um to be able to digest and

1483
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:50,199
process raw rough food and come out with

1484
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:54,838
a fertilizer

1485
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:57,719
basically so goats are the the primary

1486
01:03:54,838 --> 01:04:01,679
large animal we have on our farm and our

1487
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:04,078
goats free roam a large area around our

1488
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:06,358
Homestead they're not fenced in our

1489
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,440
Homestead is fenced and and the goats

1490
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:13,318
have everything else um and what they do

1491
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:16,079
is is they gather food they they go

1492
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:19,000
around they they eat a a wide variety of

1493
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,240
food they they come back to the barn

1494
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:25,719
three times a day and where they pee and

1495
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:27,798
they poop and and they they make a

1496
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:30,239
incredible compost that we can gather

1497
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:33,798
and and add to our intentional compost

1498
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:36,038
piles every year and it's another way

1499
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:38,559
besides wood ships which are very slow

1500
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:42,240
slow to degrade and and don't have a lot

1501
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:43,559
of nutritive value in terms of um in

1502
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,078
terms of

1503
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:49,119
macronutrients um it's another way for

1504
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,480
us to to gather biomass from our

1505
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,960
surrounding area bring it here onto our

1506
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,318
farm and process it into kind of a a

1507
01:04:53,960 --> 01:05:00,079
super fertilizer

1508
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:02,278
um and and an inoculant of microbiology

1509
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,240
I want to I want to poke at that bit did

1510
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:07,358
you did you really mean to suggest that

1511
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:09,199
the that the goats come back to the farm

1512
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,480
to poop and that they they don't just

1513
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:13,118
drop it wherever they are walking around

1514
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,000
they absolutely drop it wherever they

1515
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,599
are walking around okay no no so they

1516
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,119
they come back to the barn they're

1517
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,559
they're always pooping right on okay I

1518
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:23,318
was going to I was going to say this a

1519
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:25,039
lot of their poop ends up in the barn

1520
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,000
what they do is they'll roam around and

1521
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:29,599
then they'll come back and Loaf and hang

1522
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,358
out at the barn and drink water and

1523
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,119
during that time they're continuing to

1524
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,598
poop all right great the way I heard it

1525
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,358
I'm like do they come back to the barn

1526
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:37,920
as a toilet I've never heard that about

1527
01:05:36,358 --> 01:05:39,920
goats but but now we're really

1528
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,358
developing our our animal training like

1529
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,960
bring don't pee not yet no you hold it

1530
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:45,880
till you get back to the barn all right

1531
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,119
I I understand more clearly now they're

1532
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,119
just they're just always pooping and and

1533
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:51,960
they naturally come back to the barn for

1534
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:56,559
shelter and water and they drop a load

1535
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:59,240
there too yeah good um so do when when

1536
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:03,079
you bring in manure from another

1537
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:05,558
property um how suspicious are you of

1538
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:09,119
that manure like like how much do you

1539
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:10,798
want to know about those animals before

1540
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:14,318
you're willing to bring the manure onto

1541
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:17,400
your property you you want to know a lot

1542
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:19,358
um you know early on I brought horse

1543
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,119
manure on and and there's a couple

1544
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:23,920
aspects with horse manure horses are

1545
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:26,400
basically pets to a lot of people most

1546
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:30,159
people worm their horses

1547
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,960
continuously and um so wormer horses

1548
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:35,318
things kind of pass straight through

1549
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:37,358
horses so if somebody's giving their

1550
01:06:35,318 --> 01:06:40,000
horse horse wormer you basically have

1551
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:41,558
wormer in the manure yeah so you want to

1552
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,039
ask those kinds of questions are your

1553
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:46,079
horses being fed any medication another

1554
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:48,760
aspect with horse manure is because

1555
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,359
things pass through horses um something

1556
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:54,000
about the way they process you they they

1557
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:56,278
don't process a lot of magnesium so

1558
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,159
horse manure is high in magnesium that

1559
01:06:56,278 --> 01:07:00,159
will build up over time if that's the

1560
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:01,960
one manure you're using and you'll get

1561
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:04,960
an imbalance between the calcium and

1562
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:07,838
magnesium in your soil um right now one

1563
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:11,720
of our primary manure inputs is from an

1564
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:16,078
organic Dairy where we we get probably

1565
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:19,439
40 to 50 yards of of dairy manure solids

1566
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:22,519
from an organic Dairy which is wonderful

1567
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,920
it it's great material um one of the

1568
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:28,639
challenges with that is that they they

1569
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,240
dust the feeding stalls in the barn so

1570
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:33,558
so the way that works is is the the cows

1571
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:35,159
get milked they go to to a large barn

1572
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:37,798
with feeding stalls and then they go

1573
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:39,920
back out to pasture and while they poop

1574
01:07:37,798 --> 01:07:43,358
in the feeding stalls that gets washed

1575
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,278
in into uh a trough where the solids are

1576
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,440
separated from the liquids we get the

1577
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:50,679
solids the liquids get watered back out

1578
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:53,960
onto pasture but they dust down those

1579
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:56,239
feeding stalls with wood ash so now that

1580
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:59,039
we've been using that manure for while

1581
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:01,879
we're starting to see an intense buildup

1582
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,039
of potassium salts from the wood ash and

1583
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,880
so we're having to manage this this

1584
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:10,599
great um biomass that we're able to get

1585
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:13,960
at at a good price um delivered to us

1586
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:17,520
with dealing with potassium

1587
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:19,480
toxicity as as a potential outcome of

1588
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,960
that if we don't manage it properly what

1589
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:24,678
does management of that look like that's

1590
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:27,480
a pretty exotic concern for me um it's

1591
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:31,000
actually surpris surprisingly common

1592
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:33,238
with a lot of of heavy compost

1593
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,279
applications and especially manure

1594
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:39,238
applications um but the the way it works

1595
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,440
for us is we just make sure we age the

1596
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:45,919
compost really well and we don't add

1597
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:48,960
pottassium in any other facets it's like

1598
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,600
we used to add potassium in our

1599
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,039
amendments to our farm and we just don't

1600
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,039
do that anymore we make sure that

1601
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:58,399
doesn't happen and if we see signs

1602
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:59,798
um I believe one of one of the aspects

1603
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,960
of potassium

1604
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:06,000
toxicity is a A reduced uptake of

1605
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,920
Manganese I believe it is and a reduced

1606
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,399
uptake of Manganese during the first few

1607
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,920
weeks of of a flower cycle on cannabis

1608
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:16,599
could cause really small buds especially

1609
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:19,399
at the top so when you see like larger

1610
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,279
buds lower down on your flowering stock

1611
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:24,238
and as it comes towards what should be

1612
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:26,159
the nice top Cola on a stock it kind of

1613
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,439
flattens out

1614
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:30,960
and and stops developing into a larger

1615
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:33,639
Bud that could often be a manganese

1616
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,960
toxic a lack of Manganese which either

1617
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:38,319
could be a pottassium toxicity it also

1618
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:40,560
could be the manganese uptake didn't

1619
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,239
happen because the temperatures were too

1620
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,880
low for the uptake for that particular

1621
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:47,439
strain during its first few weeks of

1622
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,319
flowering a few things like that but but

1623
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:54,639
it's like paying close attention to to

1624
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:56,440
what we're seeing on on the the growing

1625
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,239
end of it and seeing if we're seeing

1626
01:09:56,439 --> 01:10:00,960
those effects right on so we've been

1627
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:03,000
we've been talking a lot about specifics

1628
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,480
I want to I want to pull back our Focus

1629
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,880
for a minute um and and kind of give you

1630
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:09,639
an opportunity maybe for a little bit of

1631
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,640
Storytelling because if we go back to

1632
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,640
you know where we are now in talking

1633
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,280
about your about your farm and using it

1634
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:21,320
as as an example Farm um you've got very

1635
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:23,599
uh sophisticated and and experiencer

1636
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:25,359
solutions whereas at the beginning of

1637
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,199
the show we were talking about your very

1638
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:30,479
very young and immature Farm where when

1639
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:32,039
and when you had no money and like doing

1640
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:35,198
the best you can with what you've got

1641
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:38,000
and so we know that over the last 25ish

1642
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:40,639
years your your experience has been

1643
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,960
increasing and the Farm's depth has been

1644
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:46,159
increasing and which sets us up for this

1645
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,760
question I'm curious if there were you

1646
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:51,559
know were there uh any Milestones that

1647
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:54,199
you experienced which told you that you

1648
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:56,239
were having a really positive impact on

1649
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:58,559
the biological diversity of the farm and

1650
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:01,399
that things were getting better like in

1651
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,719
the soil and in the I don't know the

1652
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:06,719
biosphere of of of your farm when you

1653
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,840
know signs that when you saw it you just

1654
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:12,198
like kind of stopped and you're like oh

1655
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:15,159
man we're we're doing it we're doing

1656
01:11:12,198 --> 01:11:17,719
it I I there's a lot of that I mean I I

1657
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:19,719
kind of walk around every day and feel

1658
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:22,640
that like oh my God this is this is

1659
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:27,039
amazing it's it's happening it's working

1660
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:29,520
um I remember specifically uh the the

1661
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:31,560
first or uh regenerative Cannabis

1662
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,000
Conference did I I don't know if you

1663
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,719
were there I wasn't at the first one no

1664
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,719
it it was it was right here in my

1665
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:41,600
neighborhood it was at at Beginnings in

1666
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:44,319
bryand here and it was relatively small

1667
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,039
and I uh I had a few people who were

1668
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:50,039
there a few of the presenters come up

1669
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:52,960
and do a quick little of the farm um and

1670
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:56,119
and one of the presenters was uh a

1671
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:58,760
myologist who focused on mic

1672
01:11:56,119 --> 01:12:00,359
micology and he said oh this is cool

1673
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:04,560
you've been growing cannabis in the same

1674
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:06,279
area for for 10 years or whatever it was

1675
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,679
at that point probably more than that

1676
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:11,719
can I take a sample and and do a

1677
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:14,158
mological study of it I was like that

1678
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:17,399
that sounds amazing sounds bad yeah and

1679
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:23,638
so he got back to me about a week later

1680
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:26,960
and he said the um the spores of the

1681
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:29,760
specific um

1682
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,399
micis fungi that have relationship with

1683
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:35,600
cannabis are dense enough in this soil

1684
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:38,319
that you could cut it by 10 parts and

1685
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:41,880
sell it as an inoculate

1686
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:44,679
wow that must have for you I was like

1687
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,480
what the heck well I I didn't know and I

1688
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:49,239
was like well does that mean we're doing

1689
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:53,158
a good job or that commercial inoculants

1690
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:55,599
are ridiculous and he said a little both

1691
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:58,359
right yeah that that is Fant fantastic

1692
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,639
and to to know that um that you know it

1693
01:12:58,359 --> 01:13:04,319
was your your soil was that fungally

1694
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:05,359
rich um it really gives you um an

1695
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:08,000
understanding that you've got like room

1696
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:10,559
for error right cuz you're you're not

1697
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,719
barely getting by your your soil is

1698
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,880
actually

1699
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:18,560
bursting and and you know some of it I I

1700
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:22,760
think you just end up with a lot of

1701
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:25,760
happy accidents you know um like I I

1702
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,000
have thought a lot you know while I'm on

1703
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:31,119
my way to bed and don't have a piece of

1704
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:34,319
paper or things like that of you know

1705
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:37,039
the idea of of of micro risal

1706
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:41,759
relationships now there's a difference

1707
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:44,479
between um spores and active micro Risa

1708
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:48,320
that that are in the soil and there's

1709
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:50,519
active microa on the Cannabis Roots what

1710
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:54,079
what makes micor Risa go into kind of a

1711
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:57,040
suspended state is not having those

1712
01:13:54,079 --> 01:14:00,639
relationships so if you go into a winter

1713
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:03,079
time where your soil is bare the microa

1714
01:14:00,639 --> 01:14:05,679
that's alive no longer is there's spores

1715
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:07,279
maybe maybe it'll build up again but

1716
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,679
it'll take longer to build up again in

1717
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:11,319
the spring and I've I've been curious

1718
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,000
and I actually haven't done the the

1719
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:15,960
researcher looked at it it's like is

1720
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,679
there specific cover crops that that

1721
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:22,359
have the same micro risal relationships

1722
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:24,000
with the same species as does a cannabis

1723
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:26,319
crop or a crop you're growing for that

1724
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,319
summer so that you can encourage a

1725
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:32,198
continuity of those species because you

1726
01:14:29,319 --> 01:14:33,880
know we see a lot of um you know if you

1727
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:36,919
if you go on Instagram and you look at

1728
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:39,480
people's accounts everybody um posts

1729
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:41,039
these pictures of incredible mycelium in

1730
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,439
their soil and and a lot of those

1731
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:44,560
species are wonderful they're good to

1732
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:47,678
have in your soil they're the species

1733
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:50,239
that break down um Woody material or

1734
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,000
unbroken down organic matter and and

1735
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:56,439
provide nutrients from it but then the

1736
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,359
specific fungal mat the spe specific

1737
01:14:56,439 --> 01:15:02,039
micro isal relationships that that

1738
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:04,119
directly benefit the Cannabis um in a

1739
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:06,238
more direct relationship way how do we

1740
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:09,880
keep those alive how do we proliferate

1741
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:12,399
those and and are there cover crops or

1742
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:16,319
or perennial plantings that share enough

1743
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:19,039
of the same species to be able to be the

1744
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:21,198
the kind of safe space for for those

1745
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:23,079
living species to to

1746
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:25,319
overwinter yeah cuz you don't you don't

1747
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:27,319
want the the the really beneficial for

1748
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:31,639
can cannabis like inter AES to suddenly

1749
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:33,880
be out competed by like U wood digestors

1750
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:36,760
only you know exactly and and that's

1751
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:39,520
mostly what you see and like no no shade

1752
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:42,039
on anyone I I love posting pictures of

1753
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:44,320
of all my you know micro isal mats when

1754
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:46,279
I find them but almost always it's wood

1755
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:51,679
digestors whether it's you know wine

1756
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:53,479
Caps or or the staria kind of mushrooms

1757
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,960
um that that's what you see a lot

1758
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:57,519
because they're they're the way we're

1759
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,239
gardening the way we're we're doing

1760
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,960
things whether it's through hugle beds

1761
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:04,399
or through a lot of uh of addition of

1762
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:07,600
carbon in the form of mulch really

1763
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:09,198
favors the wood digestors yeah right on

1764
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,800
all right so let's go ahead and take our

1765
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:12,799
second uh short break we'll be right

1766
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,320
back you are listening to shaping fire

1767
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,020
and my guest today is regenerative

1768
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,479
farmer Daniel

1769
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:19,600
[Music]

1770
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:21,319
Stein you've heard me talk about the

1771
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,239
award-winning cannabis seeds that come

1772
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:25,559
from the analytical breeding program of

1773
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:28,638
Seth and Eric Crawford who found Oregon

1774
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:31,199
CBD seeds in fact Seth was a guest on

1775
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:34,319
shaping fire in 2020 to talk about

1776
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:36,638
triploid genetics Seth and Eric are now

1777
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:39,519
releasing high THC seeds for homeg

1778
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:44,239
Growers and Farms as grow the revolution

1779
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:46,440
seeds at gtrr seeds.com their high THC

1780
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:49,399
seeds are extraordinary in that they

1781
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:52,238
will start to flower at 165 hours of

1782
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:54,519
daylight instead of the typical 14 1/2

1783
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:55,439

buying Autoflower seeds is that often

1859
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:50,319
you'll have as many different fenos as

1860
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:53,439
you will have seeds in a pack that can

1861
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:55,799
be fun sure but so many varieties in one

1862
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:58,638
pack is a sign of an immature seed line

1863

that hasn't been worked enough I prefer

my autoflowers to be worked enough that

1865

the aspects that the breeder was

Shango and today my guest is

1905
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:42,319
regenerative farmer Daniel Stein So

1906
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:46,039
Daniel during this last section I want

1907
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:47,759
to talk about um some macro ideas um

1908
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:50,319
around Land Management and and let's

1909
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,719
start with crop rotation um you know we

1910
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:56,119
talked a lot during the first set about

1911
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:58,239
um the the joy of plan planning the farm

1912
01:21:56,119 --> 01:22:00,599
and and how that plan can evolve over

1913
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:03,238
the years and you know that you don't

1914
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,719
have to do everything the first year um

1915
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:06,238
but you know one of the challenges that

1916
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:09,639
people get into is they really kind of

1917
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:11,519
fall in love with their Farm design and

1918
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:13,719
and where things go and so everything

1919
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,400
has a place but but as regenerative

1920
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:19,119
Farmers we also know the benefit that

1921
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:21,119
comes from crop rotation so we're not

1922
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:24,119
trying to feed the same crop with the

1923
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:27,880
same soil all the time but gosh um it's

1924
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:29,960
really easy to not rotate um crops um

1925
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:31,920
different Farmers I've spoken to will

1926
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,840
either rotate and some will be like well

1927
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,600
I just choose to amend and not rotate um

1928
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,840
I'd like to hear what your thoughts

1929
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:42,679
are um I think my thoughts on this is is

1930
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,319
do what you can see see where rotations

1931
01:22:42,679 --> 01:22:48,480
are important for you and and where they

1932
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:51,840
aren't um and sometimes it it's

1933
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:54,559
self-limiting for instance with cannabis

1934
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,960
we couldn't rotate because we had such a

1935
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,840
hard time explaining to the Regulatory

1936
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,279
Agencies what crop rotation is and we

1937
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,639
didn't feel like redrawing and

1938
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:07,399
resubmitting our Maps every year oh um

1939
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:11,760
and but what's interesting is that led

1940
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:15,359
us to a discovery which is that I think

1941
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:18,800
cannabis likes to grow in the same spot

1942
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:21,119
and when I started thinking about it and

1943
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,560
and imagining cannabis growing in the

1944
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:25,119
wild you know like a ditch weed for

1945
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:27,280
instance

1946
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:30,599
cannabis produces a ton of seeds that

1947
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:34,238
fall right there and and regrow right

1948
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:38,199
there um so I think cannabis as a plant

1949
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:41,959
is used to growing in its own shadow I

1950
01:23:38,198 --> 01:23:43,319
guess you would say um and you know that

1951
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,480
doesn't change the fact that crop

1952
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:47,399
rotation can reduce pest pressure

1953
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:49,759
especially pests that tend to overwinter

1954
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:53,599
in the soil or things like that or

1955
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:57,159
wouldn't be beneficial but I I think for

1956
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:58,719
us for our different crops we weigh the

1957
01:23:57,158 --> 01:24:01,479
benefit of crop

1958
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:04,520
rotation versus the challenge of crop

1959
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:06,919
rotation and decide individually on each

1960
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:10,560
thing um you know for instance in our

1961
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:13,600
vegetable farm we have a block that is

1962
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,679
lettuce production that we don't rotate

1963
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,639
because the infrastructure that it takes

1964
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:20,840
for us to have year round lettuce

1965
01:24:17,639 --> 01:24:23,520
production in this hot Aid climate

1966
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:25,560
doesn't lend itself well to rotation and

1967
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,679
lettuce doesn't see to be a problem in

1968
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:32,639
terms of nutrient use or pest in with

1969
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:34,840
rotation things like um garlic and

1970
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:37,279
tomatoes and carrots we tend to rotate

1971
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:39,520
and primarily our rotation for those

1972
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:41,039
isn't nutrient based because we are so

1973
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:44,560
well provided with nutrients through

1974
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:48,760
compost our rotation tends to be what

1975
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:51,239
crops do a good job of reducing weed

1976
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:53,320
pressure for the next crop that doesn't

1977
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:56,039
do well with weed pressure like for

1978
01:24:53,319 --> 01:24:59,319
instance carrots might come after

1979
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:03,079
zucchini because zucchini reduced the

1980
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:05,559
the seed bank of weeds in that area and

1981
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:07,000
then carrots can come after them and

1982
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:10,520
things like that

1983
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,639
so it's one of those things uh cover

1984
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:15,920
it's more important to plant

1985
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:19,560
stuff a and get it in the ground than to

1986
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:22,199
get it just right because um at the end

1987
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,920
of the day you'd rather have a a you

1988
01:25:22,198 --> 01:25:24,960
know carrot that's not perfect than not

1989
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,800
to have any

1990
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:30,079
carrots um and it's similar to how I

1991
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,719
feel about uh planting with moon cycles

1992
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:33,600
like plant it out try to plant with the

1993
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:36,118
moon cycles if you don't miss it if you

1994
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,199
miss it don't wait a month to plant

1995
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:42,158
again because it's better to have it

1996
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:45,839
growing a month then to to hit it on

1997
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:48,839
exactly the energetic cycle

1998
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,440
um that bit that you said about right on

1999
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,480
do your best that's a good theme for

2000
01:25:50,439 --> 01:25:54,599
today you know that you kind of blew my

2001
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:56,879
mind at the at the top of your answer

2002
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:59,239
when you when you pointed out that

2003
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,800
cannabis seeds when mature are pushed

2004
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:02,799
out of the flower and just dropped to

2005
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,440
the ground at its own feet and start

2006
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,039
next year's plants right there at its

2007
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:08,799
feet you know they're they're they're

2008
01:26:06,039 --> 01:26:10,600
not they're not air distributed and and

2009
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,199
while while they could be distributed by

2010
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:14,440
birds that's that's really not their

2011
01:26:12,198 --> 01:26:17,399
main shtick they really are birds crack

2012
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:19,198
them open there you go so so they don't

2013
01:26:17,399 --> 01:26:22,118
even they don't even survive the process

2014
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:24,759
so um yeah that that really kind of sets

2015
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:27,599
crop rotation for cannabis in my in a

2016
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:29,480
totally in a totally different realm uh

2017
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,560
I'm already envisioning the the next

2018
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:35,039
time I talk to a microbiologist about

2019
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,320
the difference between um the root

2020
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:40,079
structures of of of plants that need to

2021
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:42,840
be cover or not cover crop need to be

2022
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:45,719
rotated versus ones who don't because

2023
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:48,520
I'm sure that life in the rizosphere is

2024
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:51,118
entirely different for plants that are

2025
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:54,239
are built to be the same location every

2026
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:56,519
year yeah and and that micro risal

2027
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,799
relationship is there too it's like the

2028
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:00,280
roots of the previous year are there

2029
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,400
with all of its

2030
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:04,399
microbiology while you plant the next

2031
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:07,399
year yeah and they must have very Burly

2032
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:09,759
exit dates too I'd imagine so it sure

2033
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:11,519
does seem like it yeah right on so so

2034
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,119
let's let's talk about another variety

2035
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,880
of Land Management other than crop

2036
01:27:13,118 --> 01:27:17,679
rotation so you know we we've been

2037
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:20,480
talking about different parts of your

2038
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:22,480
parcel and how they relate but really if

2039
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:27,238
we if we pull the pull the camera out

2040
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:31,079
your whole whole parcel is one big um

2041
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:34,559
land mass of growing as well um what

2042
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:37,399
kinds of Forward Thinking big picture

2043
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,920
Land Management do you use on the parcel

2044
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:40,719
as a whole I'm thinking stuff like

2045
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:44,359
controlled Burns and things like that

2046
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:49,319
that can regenerate the property itself

2047
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:53,519
yeah exactly um so our homestad is

2048
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:58,158
perhaps 5 to 10 acres of of the overall

2049
01:27:53,520 --> 01:28:04,159
parcel and on 170 Acres most of it is

2050
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:07,279
forested and relatively steep um and

2051
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:09,638
here in in Northern California our our

2052
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:12,399
native Forest environment has been very

2053
01:28:09,639 --> 01:28:14,639
affected by by extractive Land

2054
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:18,118
Management and the

2055
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:21,880
exclusion uh of native cultural Land

2056
01:28:18,118 --> 01:28:23,880
Management um so when we're looking at

2057
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:25,719
the overall property we're trying to

2058
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:28,840
understand how we take it from this

2059
01:28:25,719 --> 01:28:31,719
state where it's out of balance because

2060
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,719
of of logging and fire suppression and

2061
01:28:31,719 --> 01:28:37,679
get it back into its Natural Balance

2062
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:41,560
which for this area is is a natural fire

2063
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:44,000
regimen and more of an old growth less

2064
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:45,159
less trees more space between the trees

2065
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,760
more

2066
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:49,479
biodiversity um so yeah we're we're

2067
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:53,159
looking intensely at that we've we've

2068
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:55,439
partnered with um some local nonprofits

2069
01:28:53,158 --> 01:28:58,719
that work on on Watershed restoration

2070
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:02,479
we're doing some big in-depth studies of

2071
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:05,039
of how groundwater moves through the the

2072
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:08,799
soil here basically in this area

2073
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:09,800
geologically we have a a Bedrock layer

2074
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,000
that's

2075
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:17,239
relatively impenetrable by water on a

2076
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:22,279
lot of it and then a 20 to 30 foot deep

2077
01:29:17,238 --> 01:29:24,399
soil sponge on top of that and and um we

2078
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:26,800
don't have aquafers our summer time

2079
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:29,198
water is the water that slowly moves

2080
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:32,480
through that sponge from from The Ridges

2081
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:33,879
down to the creeks and out so where we

2082
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:37,000
have groundwater Wells where we're

2083
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:38,920
studying infiltration from rain how long

2084
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,760
it stays in the soil where it moves

2085
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:43,920
through the Watershed and then we're

2086
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:47,119
going to be doing some some um Forest

2087
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:50,840
restoration work thinning and liming and

2088
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:52,799
and just kind of every bringing it back

2089
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,679
into balance Forest restoration work we

2090
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:58,960
could do in that area and see seeing how

2091
01:29:54,679 --> 01:30:02,520
that changes the water flow through that

2092
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:04,359
watered and then moving on after we get

2093
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:07,719
to study that for a couple of years to

2094
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:09,559
doing a prescribed fire in that area and

2095
01:30:07,719 --> 01:30:11,960
seeing how that affects water

2096
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:14,000
infiltration and does it affect the pH

2097
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:16,560
of the groundwater and how does that

2098
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,000
change the soil structure and things

2099
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,679
like that so that's kind of the long

2100
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,679
range is looking towards how we get this

2101
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:26,719
large parcel back to a place where we

2102
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:31,319
can manage it through the use of

2103
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:33,198
prescribed natural fire and then also

2104
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:34,880
what land management techniques we can

2105
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:36,319
use on a closer level and that's where

2106
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,359
things like the goats come in they're

2107
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:43,039
kind of like a biological fire where

2108
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:46,158
they consume a lot of the biomass around

2109
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:48,118
around our area and keep it down so so

2110
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:50,399
not only does it get into a better

2111
01:30:48,118 --> 01:30:52,359
balance but it keeps us fire safe we we

2112
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:54,719
are in a fire prone environment and

2113
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:58,319
because of this out of balance

2114
01:30:54,719 --> 01:31:00,399
with fire that we have it is um it it's

2115
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:03,920
very catastrophic when it happens as we

2116
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:06,559
all know yeah um you know the way that

2117
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,920
you talk about these bigger projects

2118
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:11,800
which um it's amazing that you are able

2119
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:14,359
to find time or create time to do

2120
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,920
something that that that is that big and

2121
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:20,118
future-minded

2122
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:22,319
versus just the daily demands of a farm

2123
01:31:20,118 --> 01:31:25,439
but really that extra effort that you

2124
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:28,000
put in it's it's it's like the farming

2125
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:29,879
um equivalent of generational wealth you

2126
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,238
know it's like it's like you're you're

2127
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:35,840
doing these studies and you're learning

2128
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:38,279
H how the the the farm uh parcel will be

2129
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:42,119
will be better over time with your eye

2130
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:44,198
on 20 and 30 years out so that the you

2131
01:31:42,118 --> 01:31:47,079
know you can be a participant in the

2132
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:51,519
evolution of the nature around you but

2133
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:54,238
also that um your farm has got a

2134
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:57,080
reliable backbone

2135
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:58,759
uh you know in case in case your your

2136
01:31:57,079 --> 01:32:00,920
kids want to take it over in time or

2137
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:03,560
something like that and I I think that's

2138
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:05,840
I think that's philosophically really uh

2139
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:08,639
important to regenerative farming and

2140
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,719
and and often given short shrift well

2141
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,239
and and land ownership is funny it's

2142
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:15,039
like um you know I'm here now maybe my

2143
01:32:13,238 --> 01:32:18,238
kids will be here maybe they won't but

2144
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:20,439
this land will be here either way and in

2145
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:23,039
terms of like time to do this I'm I'm

2146
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:26,319
super fortunate I I have great

2147
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:28,000
Partnerships um I'm do some grant

2148
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:29,679
writing but I'm working with local

2149
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,520
nonprofits that are doing the grant

2150
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:33,600
writing actually doing the work and I'm

2151
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,400
just coordinating with them to see that

2152
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,679
it's happening oh that's

2153
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:40,479
great um it's so it's wonderful having

2154
01:32:38,679 --> 01:32:43,760
people like that working on your

2155
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:45,799
behalf yeah it's incredible and you know

2156
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:48,239
to some degree it's the openness to it

2157
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:52,320
and the the the engaging in the

2158
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:57,118
community constantly in these spheres of

2159
01:32:52,319 --> 01:33:00,118
you know a a big part here as the the

2160
01:32:57,118 --> 01:33:01,519
economy is Shifting here as as cannabis

2161
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:04,158
economy has changed and gotten

2162
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:06,679
integrated into this larger broken

2163
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:10,079
economy good saying it's shifting is

2164
01:33:06,679 --> 01:33:12,960
like the the the the nicest possible way

2165
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:15,760
to put what's going on around you yeah I

2166
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,600
mean think it it's honestly it's coming

2167
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,760
into balance but unfortunately it's

2168
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,960
coming into balance with a broken system

2169
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,360
yeah it sure is and that's that's kind

2170
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:27,198
of the way it goes but oh one of the

2171
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:31,319
economies that is starting to take some

2172
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:33,960
of that um burden is is the restoration

2173
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:36,198
economy what we have here is an

2174
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:40,198
incredible amount of of beautiful

2175
01:33:36,198 --> 01:33:42,519
forested land in our area and it it

2176
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:44,118
needs work it needs restoration if we're

2177
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:47,719
going to have healthy Fisheries if we're

2178
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:49,279
going to be a fire safe Community Etc so

2179
01:33:47,719 --> 01:33:51,439
um you kind of set me up perfectly these

2180
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:54,439
next two questions are uh economics

2181
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:56,519
based and the first one is um uh you

2182
01:33:54,439 --> 01:33:59,000
know what is the economic impact of

2183
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,480
switching to regenerative farming you

2184
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,439
know on a small farm you you weren't you

2185
01:34:01,479 --> 01:34:05,919
weren't petroleum base to begin with so

2186
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:08,079
it wasn't that much of a swing but um

2187
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,560
you certainly stopped you know double

2188
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:12,800
digging and and other uh potentially

2189
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:15,400
laborious uh practices but you probably

2190
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,760
also traded those for other laborious

2191
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:20,479
practices and and okay you're you're

2192
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,800
saving money on on a lot of inputs that

2193
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:25,799
a non-regenerative farm would be buying

2194
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:27,880
in town but then but then you also have

2195
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:29,760
to buy materials to do other types of

2196
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:33,679
projects there's like all of these uh

2197
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:39,039
tradeoffs in both directions and so um

2198
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:41,920
so for regenerative farming I think

2199
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:43,600
incorrectly is is assumed to be so much

2200
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:47,239
more expensive to do because you don't

2201
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:49,119
get to use the shortcuts of of of modern

2202
01:34:47,238 --> 01:34:51,399
farming which is also happens to be

2203
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:54,319
poisoning everybody so I'd just like to

2204
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:57,839
hear um how you how you kind like weigh

2205
01:34:54,319 --> 01:35:00,000
it out about the the economic impact um

2206
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,920
for you specifically on regenerative

2207
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,800
farming regarding some of the other

2208
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:07,880
options that you have in front of

2209
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:09,480
you yeah I I mean I think for the

2210
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:12,600
options I have in front of me

2211
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:15,279
regenerative farming is by far the most

2212
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:18,560
economically feasible it's like when you

2213
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:21,479
align your values and your goals with

2214
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:24,440
what naturally wants to happen anyway

2215
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:27,399
you're not needing the products

2216
01:35:24,439 --> 01:35:28,519
and the the physical energy to fight

2217
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:33,279
against the

2218
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:35,119
flow um on a larger scale yeah

2219
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:36,880
industrial farming benefits from

2220
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:39,198
economies of scale and that's something

2221
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,880
that's that's hard to do on our level of

2222
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:44,919
regenerative farming I know there is

2223
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:46,480
regenerative farming at scale um that

2224
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:48,399
that does take advantage of some of

2225
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:51,000
those economies of scale but I wouldn't

2226
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:54,799
have an economy of scale in our type of

2227
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,520
farm even if I were to spray poison on

2228
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:00,360
everything and road to till the crap out

2229
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:03,600
of it um you know and when it comes down

2230
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:05,759
to it it's like it has to work

2231
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,760
economically if you're doing it as a

2232
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:12,199
business otherwise it doesn't work um

2233
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:16,000
but it also has to work you know you

2234
01:36:12,198 --> 01:36:20,519
couldn't pay me enough money to spray

2235
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,639
poison on my land I live here um so it

2236
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,639
even if that worked economically it

2237
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:28,679
wouldn't work so you have to draw your

2238
01:36:25,639 --> 01:36:31,279
boundaries somewhere and luckily with

2239
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:34,118
with regenerative noil farming it it

2240
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:37,479
does work it is less work to not till it

2241
01:36:34,118 --> 01:36:41,198
is less work to not spray poison

2242
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:46,599
sometimes you do lose crops to to pests

2243
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:49,319
um as as one of my great um farming

2244
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,119
Mentor friends Casey O'Neal from Happy

2245
01:36:49,319 --> 01:36:53,238
Day says when when you're selling

2246
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:55,079
products to to customers and your kale

2247
01:36:53,238 --> 01:36:56,638
hasn't nice hole in it it's like the

2248
01:36:55,079 --> 01:37:00,559
kale is delicious and the hole doesn't

2249
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:02,279
taste like anything it's like it you get

2250
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,719
the products you get because of the way

2251
01:37:02,279 --> 01:37:09,399
you farm and they it's a benefit it it

2252
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:12,439
it really is a benefit economically so

2253
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:14,638
um I know that I'm kind of inside of a

2254
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:17,919
bubble that that I'm probably in with

2255
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:20,719
you because the people that I roll with

2256
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,000
uh literally roll with um we're all into

2257
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:25,639
regeneratively grown outdoor flower

2258
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,960
right that's what what we smoke and um

2259
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:30,239
and we're not going to we don't we're

2260
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:37,319
not going to spend our our our our money

2261
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:40,198
um uh buying uh you know a plus b flour

2262
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:43,479
from a dispensary and we're certainly

2263
01:37:40,198 --> 01:37:44,919
not going to grow you know salt sodium

2264
01:37:43,479 --> 01:37:48,319
flowers we're going to do it

2265
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:50,118
regeneratively in Outdoors um that said

2266
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:54,279
we are in a bubble right and there there

2267
01:37:50,118 --> 01:37:57,198
is a market as as a whole and so um I'm

2268
01:37:54,279 --> 01:37:59,279
curious to know um have you seen an

2269
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:02,319
increase in demand for your

2270
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:04,319
regeneratively produced cannabis because

2271
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:07,359
you know as somebody in journalism I'm

2272
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:09,719
certainly helping you know raise the

2273
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:11,920
profile of regenerative and all of us

2274
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:15,599
who are in regenerative smoke

2275
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:17,319
regenerative but um I I I'm not familiar

2276
01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:20,560
with like how much of the market is

2277
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:22,759
being purchased regenerative and there

2278
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:27,199
you are on the front line so are are you

2279
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:29,239
seeing in increased demand for your uh

2280
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:33,799
quality of cannabis

2281
01:38:29,238 --> 01:38:36,839
flour yeah yeah absolutely we are um and

2282
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:39,480
it's an engagement thing it it it's

2283
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:42,719
having direct contact as much with with

2284
01:38:39,479 --> 01:38:44,519
Bud tenders as with customers and our

2285
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:47,880
brand which we share with a number of

2286
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:50,320
other regenerated Farmers is is Farm Cut

2287
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:52,118
and what we've noticed with that is is

2288
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:54,679
the product we're coming to customers

2289
01:38:52,118 --> 01:38:57,000
with sometimes is a hard sell we're

2290
01:38:54,679 --> 01:39:00,079
selling topshelf

2291
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:04,118
flow minimally processed so basically

2292
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:08,479
untrimmed to and uh in quarter ounce

2293
01:39:04,118 --> 01:39:10,679
amounts and it the the the hardest part

2294
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:14,039
is actually getting customers to try it

2295
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:16,599
the first time because nearly across the

2296
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:19,519
board customers that try it come back

2297
01:39:16,599 --> 01:39:22,679
for more because

2298
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:26,800
yeah objectively there is a difference

2299
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:29,840
in the experience from it so um the the

2300
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:33,880
challenge is definitely engaging with

2301
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:37,000
Bud tenders who often push indoor flower

2302
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:39,359
or Brands they're familiar with whether

2303
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,960
out of habit or out of market

2304
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:44,519
dynamics um but I I feel like we have

2305
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:48,079
seen an increase in in people seeking

2306
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:50,560
out regenerative flour and uh an

2307
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:53,719
definitely an increase in the people who

2308
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,480
do seek out regenerative flour

2309
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:58,079
back for our brand after they have an

2310
01:39:55,479 --> 01:40:00,519
experience with it yeah the proof really

2311
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:02,519
is in the pudding isn't it like after

2312
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:05,239
you smoke outdoor that was you know

2313
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:08,199
carefully grown regeneratively it really

2314
01:40:05,238 --> 01:40:10,158
it really does open up um what you think

2315
01:40:08,198 --> 01:40:11,919
cannabis can be because of the wider

2316
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:13,399
chirping profiles and you know the

2317
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,639
burlin in

2318
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:18,039
general well and the challenge for us

2319
01:40:15,639 --> 01:40:20,079
and why we created that brand is you you

2320
01:40:18,039 --> 01:40:22,560
can grow the best regenerative flower in

2321
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:24,960
the world and if you don't cure it right

2322
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:27,520
it's not great and you can cure it

2323
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,840
perfectly and if it makes its way to

2324
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,440
Market in a way that doesn't preserve

2325
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:35,480
that and bring it to the customer in its

2326
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:38,479
best possible form then you also lose

2327
01:40:35,479 --> 01:40:40,479
that quality and we kind of created a a

2328
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:43,079
a way to get it to the customer in the

2329
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:45,559
way we enjoy it and it blows people's

2330
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:49,359
minds it's like when you when you open a

2331
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:51,480
jar that's been vacuum sealed and and

2332
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:53,479
not trimmed and you you break it open

2333
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:56,319
for the first time and break a couple Su

2334
01:40:53,479 --> 01:40:58,638
leafes off of it it's overwhelming like

2335
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:01,599
the smell and then when you smoke

2336
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:06,480
properly cured properly stored flour the

2337
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:09,679
experience is is just different and more

2338
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:13,559
full and more layered and nuanced than

2339
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:16,158
the experience from some fast DED

2340
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:18,440
indoor um you know there are two other

2341
01:41:16,158 --> 01:41:20,279
aspects I want to um uh economic

2342
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:22,399
regenerative aspects I want to focus on

2343
01:41:20,279 --> 01:41:24,880
um one you've already mentioned which is

2344
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:27,158
the relationship with Bud tenders right

2345
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,840
um because it is interesting that um you

2346
01:41:27,158 --> 01:41:32,279
know bud tenders do have a lot of

2347
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:35,279
control in uh uh influence and and where

2348
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:36,920
they drive people for their purchases so

2349
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,439
having a good relationship with Bud

2350
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:43,199
tenders is important and in a lot of

2351
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:45,678
ways like you know um that friendship is

2352
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:47,759
also a regenerative farming P practice

2353
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:50,719
in a way in that it's it's creating

2354
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:52,840
community and Outreach and and uh

2355
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:55,359
reaching out with um you know your

2356
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:57,840
philos phos ophy of regenerative growing

2357
01:41:55,359 --> 01:42:00,479
and and what that meaning is but but

2358
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:04,119
also and and where I want to focus more

2359
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:07,158
is um the cooperation and Community

2360
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:09,880
spirit that you um need to have with

2361
01:42:07,158 --> 01:42:12,319
other Farmers on a basic level when you

2362
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:16,079
are trading resources like oh you know

2363
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:18,920
I'll trade you I'll trade you hay for

2364
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:21,439
manure or whatever the trades may be or

2365
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:23,719
or or sharing equipment those kinds of

2366
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:25,638
relationships become really essential in

2367
01:42:23,719 --> 01:42:29,279
regenerative farming when you're trying

2368
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:31,840
to um you know be very resourceful but

2369
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:34,238
then also you you mentioned uh Farm Cut

2370
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,760
cannabis um the brand that you've put

2371
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:39,519
together with um you know looks like

2372
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:42,360
four different farms and yourselves

2373
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:45,840
where um you know you you kind of get

2374
01:42:42,359 --> 01:42:48,679
the benefits of being a scaled Farm

2375
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:52,639
without having to do the the negatives

2376
01:42:48,679 --> 01:42:55,639
of a scaled farm and and and that

2377
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:57,719
synergy only comes together because you

2378
01:42:55,639 --> 01:43:00,679
get together with these all small farms

2379
01:42:57,719 --> 01:43:03,158
and then market and distribute as one

2380
01:43:00,679 --> 01:43:04,880
and we all know that that that was you

2381
01:43:03,158 --> 01:43:08,519
know that was attempted at the beginning

2382
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:10,199
of of you know proposition 64 days by

2383
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:12,000
Outsiders where they're oh we're going

2384
01:43:10,198 --> 01:43:15,359
to pull together all the small farms and

2385
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:18,279
then it ended up being a big Croc um but

2386
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:21,839
but but now in kind of like the dust of

2387
01:43:18,279 --> 01:43:24,559
the Brokenness of of the Cannabis uh

2388
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,400
system in in California we're seeing

2389
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:30,920
Farmers come together like really like

2390
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:34,638
over the dinner table in in in a smaller

2391
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:35,319
less grandiose way and it appears from

2392
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:38,239
the

2393
01:43:35,319 --> 01:43:39,960
outside um that it's working so so maybe

2394
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:42,039
talk a little bit about this partnership

2395
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:45,520
with um you know that you that you all

2396
01:43:42,039 --> 01:43:48,279
are calling Farm Cut cannabis yeah so

2397
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:50,719
that that partnership is is five Farms

2398
01:43:48,279 --> 01:43:53,960

it's just wonderful we're we're

2403
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:09,399
like-minded farmers who came together we

2404
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:12,000
couldn't exactly create a co-op but we

2405
01:44:09,399 --> 01:44:14,638
created a brand together that we can

2406
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:18,198
share a and like you'd said share

2407
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:21,599
resources share share the burden of the

2408
01:44:18,198 --> 01:44:24,879
tasks um Joseph for memoral spirit is

2409
01:44:21,599 --> 01:44:26,800
our our our primary salesperson and he

2410
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:28,560
uh because other members of his family

2411

are taking care of the firm he's able to

2412
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:34,119
travel a lot and and visit dispensaries

2413
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,599
and and talk to people about about Farm

2414
01:44:34,118 --> 01:44:36,639
Cut and about our products and make

2415
01:44:35,599 --> 01:44:39,239
those

2416
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:41,719
relationships and and we've played to

2417
01:44:39,238 --> 01:44:44,279
all of our strengths and been able to

2418
01:44:41,719 --> 01:44:46,079
develop systems and processes that that

2419
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:48,519
work for us whether it's sharing

2420
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:52,079
equipment or pooling our resources to be

2421
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:54,480
able to say um we have packaging that's

2422
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:57,319
a standard mason jar and we could not

2423
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:58,839
find a good childproof lid for a

2424
01:44:57,319 --> 01:45:01,359
standard mason jar that didn't have

2425
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:03,560
plastic in it so we were able to create

2426
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:04,839
one to to go to a factory and say we

2427
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:07,760
want

2428
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:11,520
plant-based childproof lid for for this

2429
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:13,920
size jar and and create that and buack

2430

and bulk and things like that and it

2431
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:19,960
it's heartening it's it's um in this

2432
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:22,279
economic system where it's going towards

2433
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:26,359
integration with the kind of dog heat

2434
01:45:22,279 --> 01:45:27,559
dog venture capitalist capitalist world

2435
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:29,839
the the

2436
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,239
cooperation and and the building

2437
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:34,719
something together gives us a lot of

2438
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:36,519
Hope and a lot of a good feeling

2439
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:39,560
especially doing it with people we just

2440
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:41,520
like seeing and being around anyway that

2441
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:42,920
yeah totally the doing business with

2442
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:45,080
people that we actually like really

2443
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:46,520
makes all the difference in the world

2444
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:49,679
it's so great you know it'd be really

2445
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:52,080
funny if this um if this uh new

2446
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:56,279
childproof cap for mason jars that you

2447
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:59,238
all invented that that you know that the

2448
01:45:56,279 --> 01:46:00,759
patent for that actually ends up

2449
01:45:59,238 --> 01:46:03,638
becoming popular because that's actually

2450
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:06,280
a really novel useful idea and ends up

2451
01:46:03,639 --> 01:46:08,000
making you all more more income than the

2452
01:46:06,279 --> 01:46:09,359
Cannabis itself you know there was there

2453
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,679
was somebody already doing it and we

2454
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:13,880
were we were getting those um and they

2455
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:16,440
were great products they they were on

2456
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:18,239
the pricey side but the main thing that

2457
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:20,279
that we wanted is something that didn't

2458
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:23,198
have any plastic and the one we had

2459
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:26,399
initially started with our brand is made

2460
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:28,960
with a flax fiber and a recycled plastic

2461
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:32,638
and we wanted one that was entirely

2462
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:34,599
biological plant-based material and and

2463
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,800
that's where we got into it and yeah who

2464
01:46:34,599 --> 01:46:39,480
knows what the the long long term of

2465
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:41,679
that I'm I'm just right now keeping my

2466
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:43,799
fingers crossed that that California

2467
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:45,920
could be a big enough market that we can

2468
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:48,440
we can sell a majority of our product

2469
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:52,079
through this brand that is is a joy to

2470
01:46:48,439 --> 01:46:53,399
to be part of and um we're not there yet

2471
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:55,439
but we're doing

2472
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:57,479
really well excellent excellent well

2473
01:46:55,439 --> 01:47:00,279
it's nice it's nice to see good people

2474
01:46:57,479 --> 01:47:03,118
coming together in a good union uh for

2475
01:47:00,279 --> 01:47:05,920
for shared benefit yeah it feels great

2476
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:09,039
too I mean it's it's we get such

2477
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:12,319
incredibly positive feedback from from

2478
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:14,599
customers and dispensaries about it that

2479
01:47:12,319 --> 01:47:17,960
it even just that alone besides the

2480
01:47:14,599 --> 01:47:19,719
business aspect it's like um it's a good

2481
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,920
feeling to know that the thing you put

2482
01:47:19,719 --> 01:47:23,359
so much energy into creating well and

2483
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,679
taking care of well

2484
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:27,839
is is received and acknowledged for

2485
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:30,719
being what it is in the world and and

2486
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,920
also specifically the the Farms that you

2487
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:35,279
have partnered with I know several of

2488
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:36,880
the folks and you know like who who

2489
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:38,479
doesn't want to be in partnership with

2490
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,520
regenerative farmers who are generally

2491
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:42,598
Happy go-lucky People anyway you know I

2492
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,760
mean you know I probably know Casey the

2493
01:47:42,599 --> 01:47:47,319
best and you know great success to all

2494
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:49,920
of it you know exactly exactly great

2495
01:47:47,319 --> 01:47:51,359
success yeah so so let's finish off with

2496
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,279
this question you know like we

2497
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:56,118
intentionally designed this episode

2498
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:59,359
today so that we could talk about your

2499
01:47:56,118 --> 01:48:02,000
farm um in detail but really as an

2500
01:47:59,359 --> 01:48:03,960
example of what can happen on

2501
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,800
everybody's Farm who's listening right

2502
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:08,359
whether or not they're transitioning

2503
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:10,000
from from petroleum farming or or if

2504
01:48:08,359 --> 01:48:11,799
they're just coming to their parcel and

2505
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,118
and I think we did a did a good job of

2506
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:18,159
that um but but really like direct

2507
01:48:16,118 --> 01:48:20,079
advice really could be profound and

2508
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:23,559
inspirational so so let's finish with

2509
01:48:20,079 --> 01:48:26,679
that so what advice would you give to a

2510
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:29,280
farmer with a new parcel or who is

2511
01:48:26,679 --> 01:48:32,319
transitioning who is just starting out

2512
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:32,319
with regenerative

2513
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:40,760
practices I think the best advice um

2514
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,679
would be kind of going if you've read

2515
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:45,400
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy the

2516
01:48:42,679 --> 01:48:46,239
best advice in the world is Don't Panic

2517
01:48:45,399 --> 01:48:49,920
Oh I thought you were going to say to

2518
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:53,598
bring a towel that that's not a bad idea

2519
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:58,319
either no don't don't panic don't stress

2520
01:48:53,599 --> 01:49:00,960
do what you can none of us are are on an

2521
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:04,479
island there there's no such thing as a

2522
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:09,158
complete closed loop sustainability

2523
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:12,000
system look at your farm do your best

2524
01:49:09,158 --> 01:49:15,319
find find the resources that you have

2525
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,399
available and adapt to them find the

2526
01:49:15,319 --> 01:49:21,000
markets you have available and adapt to

2527
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:23,279
them don't be too hard on yourself for

2528
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:27,479
the things that don't work

2529
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:30,039
and and don't imagine that that we can

2530
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:33,759
be Pure or to

2531
01:49:30,039 --> 01:49:35,158
keep um that we can do everything we

2532
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,360
dream as

2533
01:49:35,158 --> 01:49:38,879
regenerative right from the

2534
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:41,639
start

2535
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:43,920
I'm you introduced me as a regenerative

2536
01:49:41,639 --> 01:49:45,800
farmer I'm not a regenerative farmer I

2537
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:49,359
don't think anybody is a regenerative

2538
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:53,400
farmer I think all of us are striving to

2539
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:55,960
align our farming with natural process

2540
01:49:53,399 --> 01:49:59,799
and balancing that with the needs of

2541
01:49:55,960 --> 01:50:02,520
being a human on earth right now and

2542
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:06,760
what is available to us and what the the

2543
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:09,800
constraints and the the the burdens that

2544
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:13,039
that that we have to deal with so find

2545
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,159
that balance don't get squeezed between

2546
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:19,560
your ideals and your

2547
01:50:15,158 --> 01:50:22,118
reality make make your way the path that

2548
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:25,199
that is best for you and then see where

2549
01:50:22,118 --> 01:50:27,519
you can prove it towards natural systems

2550
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,359
towards more sustainability and make

2551
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,960
some

2552
01:50:28,359 --> 01:50:32,920
improvement that is possible for you

2553
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:36,039
with each season and go in that

2554
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:38,679

2565
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,920
more into the realm of the possible

2566
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:08,638
