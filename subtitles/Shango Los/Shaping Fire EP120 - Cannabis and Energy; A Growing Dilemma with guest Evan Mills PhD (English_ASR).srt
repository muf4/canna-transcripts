2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,839
you and I have spent so much time and

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,239
effort defending cannabis from pretty

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,600
much everybody first we had to explain

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,920
to people cannabis was medicine and not

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,880
an addictive drug and then we had to

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,439
illustrate that Stoners were not

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:27,079
necessarily lazy or unmotivated we have

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,920
vision and take action we had to prove

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,959
to our politicians that it somehow would

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,640
benefit them just to even get it

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,359
normalized and now with all the state

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,000
laws favoring indoor cultivation we have

14
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,439
to consider the very real issue that

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,719
cannabis cultivated indoors might be bad

16
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,640
for our environment electrical grid

17
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,198
stability the Cannabis economy and the

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,799
Cannabis Community as well ouch that is

19
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:54,599
just not something I want to think about

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,159
if you're listening to this episode you

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,399
are already a good person in my book I

22
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,238
imagine lots of folks might skip this

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,159
shaping Fire episode simply because they

24
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,879
don't want to think about how much

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,200
energy cannabis

26
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,599
consumes but being in cannabis

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,118
Enthusiast means looking at everything

28
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:16,679
to do with our favorite plant and having

29
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:19,438
the backbone to know when decreasing our

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,759
carbon footprint emissions and

31
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,199
fertilizer runoff is a very important

32
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,400
consideration yes we will mostly be

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,159
talking about indoor cultivated cannabis

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,399
today but outdoor and green houses have

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,920
some energy aspects to consider too

36
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,640
whether you are an environmentalist an

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,040
outdoor cultivator an indoor cultivator

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,159
looking to decrease your bills or

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,719
looking to make a case to start growing

40
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,159

121
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,360
Angeles today we will be discussing the

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,360
ways that cannabis cultivation uses

123
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,840
energy and the places you can save money

124
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,919
by changing to energy efficient

125
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,079
Alternatives during the first set we

126
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:13,079
will talk about the overall size of the

127
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:16,000
energy footprint of us cannabis

128
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:19,478
cultivation and then dive into lights

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,319
HVAC and other big ticket energy users

130
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:24,800
during the second set we dig into drying

131
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,039
Transportation packaging and Retail

132
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,759
along with a bunch of other sleeper ways

133
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,879
that we waste energy cultivating and we

134
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,759
finished the episode looking at cannabis

135
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:37,439
delivery and energy efficient cultivars

136
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,000
along with the market and political bias

137
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,879
in favor of indoor cultivation and the

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,240
possible impacts that interstate

139
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,120
commerce and National legalization might

140
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,918
have on cannabis energy use welcome to

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,399

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,038
30 or so chapters from different experts

171
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,758
all around the Cannabis industry all

172
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,038
kinds of issues and we had the pleasure

173
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,560
of contributing a chapter to that as

174
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,878
well and I have read it it it was

175
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,680
excellent and and then when uh when

176
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,520
Dominic put it out he was actually on

177
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,439
shaping fur and we talked about that at

178
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:15,079
the time and I bet you your name came up

179
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,680
during that episode as well so um so but

180
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,758
we are here today because you have

181
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,840
recently updated your work um you have a

182
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
newly published paper in one Earth

183
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,000
called Energy intensive indoor

184
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:29,680
cultivation drives cannabis industry's

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,319
expanding carbon footprint which pretty

186
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,319
much uh like the sauce is in the title

187
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,039
right we know exactly where we're coming

188
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,639
from and so today I was I wanted I to

189
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,839
invite you on the show so that we can

190
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,519
tease out um all of the places or or at

191
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,959
least many of the places where cannabis

192
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:52,598
companies can reduce their energy

193
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,478
usage and um and and and reduce their

194
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:58,399
carbon footprint now there there's no

195
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:01,758
question you know reading your paper

196
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:04,038
that you're making the pace for outdoor

197
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,360
cannabis of which we are huge proponents

198
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:10,719
for here on shaping fire um we also

199
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,720
recognize that many of the companies

200
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,120
have got themselves into the indoor side

201
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,440
um financially and they might not be

202
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,319
able to transition out right away and so

203
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:26,199
so maybe in the interim we can at least

204
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,560
start with um uh Electrical uh being

205
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:33,719
used less often and and start moving us

206
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,440
all the industry as a whole in the right

207
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,360
direction yeah I appreciate the the

208
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,760
vantage point and you know I'd say for

209
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,519
uh for me in particular you know my home

210
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,278
field my work is around uh Energy

211
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,560
Management energy analysis Energy

212
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,159
Efficiency and where I started here on

213
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,278
this spectrum you know almost 15 years

214
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,759
ago was uh you know let's raise Energy

215
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,958
Efficiency and indoor cultivation and

216
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,720
and we can achieve whatever we need to

217
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:03,759
by doing that and over time I found how

218
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,360
uh virtually impossible that is to

219
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,240
really get to a zero net carbon so I I

220
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,079
didn't start with the assumption that

221
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
outdoor was the only really tenable you

222
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:16,799
know Direction I I came to that very

223
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,838
slowly because it it again uh my my

224
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,759
hammer is Energy Efficiency and all my

225
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,440
Solutions all my nails are Energy

226
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,039
Efficiency usually you know in the world

227
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,079
but this is a very different kind of uh

228
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,879
very interesting Rich uh you know

229
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,278
sandbox here where there are a lot more

230
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,519
options the other thing just to to uh

231
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,360
footnote is that we uh it's important to

232
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,519
talk about energy as distinct from

233
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,560
electricity it's it's not often the case

234
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,879
certainly not always the case that a

235
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:48,599
given grow uh outdoor or indoor is all

236
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,000
electric there's fossil fuel used in a

237
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,879
myriad of ways that doesn't mean in

238
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
every single grow but like in my study

239
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,039
where I'm looking at the whole life

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,639
cycle uh not just the cultivation phase

241
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,838
uh half of the total energy nationally

242
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,278
at the end of the day is fossil fuel

243
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,120
directly not even including the fossil

244
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,519
fuel going into the electricity

245
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,879
production itself uh so uh it's

246
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,959
important to think in terms of uh think

247
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,919
think widely and look widely at at where

248
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,199
energy in all its forms might be used

249
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,799
excellent thank you for pointing that

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,720
out because I I definitely used the word

251
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,599
Electrical uh earlier and and and

252
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,959
honestly I will probably slip and use it

253
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,959
again so I I appreciate you uh using

254
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,039
that Clarity and and I apologize for

255
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,799
when I I miss it again it's fine it's a

256
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,278
it's a common thing and and you know

257
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,799
maybe another thing just to layer in

258
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:37,559
here and we can come back to it later if

259
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:40,078
you want is that you know while that

260
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,119
like you said the title of the paper uh

261
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,559
you know Flags or signals one of the

262
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,480
main findings it is nuanced wording and

263
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:51,599
that uh on the one hand outdoor is not

264
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,440
intrinsically uh the solution or fully

265
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,360
sustainable and indoor you know

266
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,920
similarly there's a big spectrum of

267
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,320
emissions and things you might get so uh

268
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,159
there can be plenty of problems around

269
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,200
energy and sustainability more broadly

270
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:08,600
with outdoor so it's not simply a matter

271
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,560
of flicking a switch and uh going to uh

272
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,800
especially the current industrial scale

273
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:15,838
Paradigm of of outdoor it's more than

274
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,399
that would would be needed to really

275
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,880
address uh climate you know let alone

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,519
all the other environmental things that

277
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:26,120
we're aware of I was really surprised in

278
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:29,679
the new paper of all the places that you

279
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:33,200
illustrate where uh energy is being used

280
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:35,879
intensely and and is a is a place that

281
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,560
we can either decrease our energy use or

282
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:41,799
or get rid of it completely by replacing

283
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,719
it um I actually find more interest in

284
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,679
that than even in the lights but but

285
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,800
let's go ahead and start with that

286
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,519
because everybody pretty much considers

287
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,958
that to be the elephant in the room is

288
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,000
is that when we when we bring the plants

289
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:59,399
indoors we have to create a man-made sun

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,078
and and we do that by throwing Lots of

291
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:07,600
jewels at them and um um in in instead

292
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:10,239
of me uh trying to tease out the

293
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
specifics I know that you have answered

294
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,839
this question many times so I'm just

295
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,639
going to kind of hand you the mic and

296
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,480
ask you to describe the problem with

297
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,839
using so many so much energy in cannabis

298
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,680
indoor

299
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,360
cultivation sure and and we can start

300
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,838
with lights cuz that's where you wanted

301
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,959
to start and and I agree it's where

302
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,600
every one goes and some people okay say

303
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,759
on the lay person end of the spectrum

304
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,959
thinks that's the only en energy use

305
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,639
which is a fine you know mistake or

306
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,638
whatever for general public but uh it's

307
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,959
big lighting is Big we're talking I mean

308
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,839
of course there are different lots of

309
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,719
different growing contexts there's a

310
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,839
spectrum so you can have the the plant

311
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,000
Factory that's windowless and all the

312
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,959
lumens all the photons are electric you

313
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,039
can of course have uh I hate the term

314
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,919
mix lighting cuz it's like jargon and

315
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,198
you know Regulators use it but let's

316
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,278
call them green houses and green houses

317
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,399
can be also no electric photons or they

318
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,919
can have some electric photons and most

319
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,958
industrial uh cannabis green houses do

320
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,719
use electric lighting uh but anyway

321
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:12,679
lighting is uh you know Loosely like a

322
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,440
third of the total energy use total

323
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,000
carbon footprint it totally depends you

324
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,600
know where you are and and what uh

325
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,360
genetics you have and uh what what the

326
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,959
facilities like but you know lighting is

327
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,440
Big um and whether it's LED or hid or

328
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:31,239
some or uh something else uh metal

329
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,920
halight it's uh it's still a lot of

330
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,600
energy you know and uh people look at

331
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:38,679
the Led as this Panacea and it's rolled

332
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,519
out uh reflexively all the time in

333
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,679
conversations and I'm a big fan of LED

334
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,399
my house is all LED you know it's what's

335
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:48,838
not to like no Mercury you know Energy

336
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,958
savings but uh remember that to replace

337
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,360
let's call it 1,000 watt HID light it's

338
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,838
that's a 600 watt LED it's still like a

339
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,480
small floor heater under your desk it's

340
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,759
incredibly energy intensive and you put

341
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,680
you know few thousand of those in a big

342
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:04,600
greenhouse and you need a lot of air

343
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:07,599
conditioning to deal just with the heat

344
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,680
off the LEDs so yes it saves energy uh

345
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,680
but it only moves the needle so much and

346
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,919
it's only addressing a third of the

347
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,599
energy use and yes you may get some

348
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,838
cooling savings you may also get some

349
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,320
increased heating energy need uh so it's

350
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,360
you know it's a system we always think

351
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,519
about buildings as systems whether it's

352
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,480
a you know a school or an office or a

353
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,278
cannabis grow their leg bones connected

354
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,240
to the hipbone and lighting affects

355
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:35,000
Cooling and and you know um all the uses

356
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,720
are are connected in important ways uh

357
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,958
so I I don't know I hope that that's

358
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,600
helpful as far as lighting can talk more

359
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,518
about it there's it is I've got a

360
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,560
followup for you so so when we go to

361
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,078
conventions the lighting manufacturers

362
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:53,799
um are continuing to impress us with or

363
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,198
or seeking to impress us with um their

364
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:58,439
uh increase energy conservation and

365
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:01,879
things are getting better and and every

366
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:06,360
new model is is going to to use less

367
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:09,720
energy and and save the cultivator um uh

368
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:14,278
pocket money which is great um do you

369
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:17,240
see um uh exploratory science in

370
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,759
cultivation lights that is forthcoming

371
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,079
that's actually going to be helpful

372
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,959
because I get what you're saying right

373
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:26,198
now about Led is yes yes it's better

374
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:29,359
than metal Halli but really it's not

375
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:31,758
moving the needle that much and and if

376
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,879
if I wanted to keep my LEDs and wanted

377
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,278
to keep running indoor my first response

378
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,799
would be well the technology is almost

379
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:40,720
there and and it's about to be better

380
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,879
and so we just need to put our energy

381
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,278
into LED research instead of trying to

382
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,600
move us Outdoors

383
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,000
yeah this is a broader you know just

384
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,480
kind of conceptual problem or challenge

385
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,839
or opportunity depending how you want to

386
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,199
look at it in energy management at large

387
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,680
there there's never a silver bullet I

388
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,719
mean Data Center

389
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:05,838
cement factory cannabis grow house I

390
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,800
it's it's a Orchestra you know of of

391
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,399
measures that you need and want and are

392
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,919
prudent to pursue for all kinds of

393
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,600
reasons so there's never one thing

394
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,799
that's going to solve a problem there

395
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,519
really isn't uh even you know you look

396
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,078
at a car like an electric car well

397
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,278
there's you know 30 different Energy

398
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:24,399
Efficiency measures going on within that

399
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,278
that car so there's always a

400
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,480
constellation of things um with lighting

401
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,240
uh Ju Just to foot note a little bit

402
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,159
what we were saying a minute ago it's

403
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,000
also you know it's very uh I don't like

404
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,439
the word strain I know everybody uses it

405
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,799
but it's not actually the word that's

406
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,800
used in Agronomy you know more broadly

407
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:45,919
their their their crops you know or

408
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:47,359
their cultivars U cultivars uh there's

409
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,519
interest they're interesting papers not

410
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,240
enough of them uh but I in my paper

411
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,639
figure five brings the data together

412
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,000
from one of the studies and they looked

413
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,519
at uh uh multiple strains under LED

414
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,480
versus HID lighting and it's sobering to

415
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,959
see

416
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,000
uh that some of them don't save any

417
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,720
energy or much very little energy and

418
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,279
others Save A Lot and so there's like a

419
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,480
factor of strain and genetics and

420
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,879
cultivar in the lighting performance

421
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,679
also there's a problem again more

422
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,319
broadly in energy called the takeback

423
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,720
effect that uh actually gets kind of

424
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:22,558
embraced by uh climate deniers and so on

425
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,000
a lot by saying that well if we save

426
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,798
energy in one place we're just going to

427
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,400
use more somewhere else and I'm not that

428
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,679
person I don't subscribe to that and the

429
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,720
evidence doesn't support that but you do

430
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,840
see a lot of places where cannabis grows

431
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,960
and you'll you know in the trade

432
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,159
literature you'll see the advertisements

433
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,000
from the lighting manufactures brighter

434
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,160
than the sun not just as bright as and

435
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,839
people will increase the the DLI and

436
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,880
increase their yields and so we have to

437
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:51,599
think about energy per unit yield rather

438
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,480
than energy per square foot and so on

439
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,959
but it is often happening that people

440
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,480
because they're saving so much money on

441
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,120
lighting energy bills that they will

442
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,558
pump more light in and so that's not the

443
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,239
expected you know Behavior with Energy

444
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,599
Efficiency and so one has to look

445
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,480
carefully at how much energyy is being

446
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,079
saved and how you're measuring you know

447
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,599
those savings um so it's just a little

448
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,480
bit more in light uh you can steer me

449
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,599
back around if I if I uh didn't actually

450
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,360
answer your question that's a good

451
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:27,439
answer so my follow-up question now I

452
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:31,359
recognize that um that you are here to

453
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,798
raise the flag of using too much energy

454
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,000
and it isn't necessarily also your

455
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:40,038
mandate to solve them all and to solve

456
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,279
the policy questions behind them as well

457
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,240
so so with that in mind I'm still going

458
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,279
to ask you a Solutions policy question

459
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,440
um just because you have had this

460
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,759
conversation with many people and

461
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,000
perhaps you have heard something but um

462
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,440
you know you're you're not you know

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,079
you're you're you're a friend of

464
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,558
cannabis and and um you're aware of the

465
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:07,079
indoor outdoor cannabis debate about

466
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:09,918
quality and um you know I and generally

467
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:13,240
the guests on this show love you know we

468
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:18,600
stand with sungrown flower as as having

469
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:21,079
a wider um Aroma profile and uh

470
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,918
healthier plants and you know more

471
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,439
resilient higher yields all all of this

472
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,440
kind of business but there is something

473
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,320
um that is quite special and unique

474
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,798
about a flower that is grown indoors

475
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:38,599
it's aesthetic value and also to get um

476
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:41,400
outdoor cannabis that competes with the

477
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,918
quality of indoor um there are only a

478
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,280
handful of places in the country that

479
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,360
can do that naturally and and and so a

480
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,359
lot of people just aren't interested in

481
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:54,319
this uh discussion at all because they

482
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,839
want to grow the best cannabis in their

483
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,359
region and they don't live in

484
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:01,759
Garberville right and so um and so

485
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,798
people say hey I'm I'm going to turn to

486
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:07,640
my indoor do you have any idea of how we

487
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:10,558
can resolve the the people wanting to

488
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,880
grow good cannabis in places where the

489
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:19,519
weather is not Northern California yeah

490
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,360
great question it's so important and

491
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,759
some of the answers are counterintuitive

492
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,319
I think and I don't pretend to have all

493
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,798
the answers but it's it's such an

494
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,439
important line of conversation and and

495
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,319
uh if you you probably have already but

496
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,440
if not uh you know I think a whole show

497
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,639
on really drilling into the quality

498
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,240
question is important I'm I'm uh you

499
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,640
know there's a lot to it right what

500
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,440
defines quality there's you know the

501
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,600
visual there's the aromatic there's the

502
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,320
medical effect there's the uh

503
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,959
inebriation effect you there's so many

504
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:48,119
vectors of quality they're all

505
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,640
legitimate I mean they're all things

506
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,519
people are seeking just like a good wine

507
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,360
uh but there is debate there for sure I

508
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,879
mean there's a lot of and including in

509
00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:00,199
the science literature looking at CBD

510
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,159
profiles uh that you know outdoor is not

511
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,720
necessarily inferior at all by you know

512
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,480
many metrics and and when you look at

513
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,839
and I'm not saying it's Superior either

514
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,519
I'm just saying one can't just have like

515
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:16,038
a blanket uh concession you know that

516
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,798
indoor is superior uh and certainly when

517
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:20,480
it comes to potency I mean that itself

518
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:23,879
is a whole hour right and you know is

519
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,720
35% higher quality than 25% you know is

520
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,120
is that really how we look at this uh

521
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,880
and obviously when you're making oil

522
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,558
then that's not or any kind of extract

523
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,640
right that that's not even the thing

524
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,798
anymore so higher potency to me is one

525
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,720
of the weaker arguments you know

526
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,960
certainly uh U Aesthetics are there um

527
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,000
going back to what we were saying a few

528
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,558
minutes ago you know there is this

529
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,919
spectrum of growing environments and you

530
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,639
have people like you know Jeremy mberg

531
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,840
out out there in the Eastern east of

532
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,240
Washington growing in you know I don't

533
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:54,639
know the right word hoop houses or

534
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,919
whatnot getting you know extraordinarily

535
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,919
beautiful I think you know award-winning

536
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,679
cosmetically flowers and and I'm sure

537
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,000
many other you know people around and

538
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,159
like you said some people uh are very

539
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,079
successful but it is an art it is not as

540
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:12,679
easy as most people think uh but I think

541
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:15,678
you know that's doable and um I think

542
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,200
also there is the baked an assumption

543
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,480
you know in what you're saying which is

544
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,360
fair that everyone wants to be able to

545
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,880
grow it everywhere does everyone grow

546
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,959
pineapples everywhere does everyone grow

547
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,520
cranberries everywhere does everyone

548
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,880
grow kiwis everywhere does every

549
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,440
everyone grow you know corn everywhere I

550
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,679
mean I live on the mesino coast I can't

551
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,558
grow freaking corn I'm not going to

552
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,919
build a greenhouse to grow corn you know

553
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:40,319
you can't really succeed at that anyway

554
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,520
so there is there is a kind of swimming

555
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,359
against the tide there I did one of the

556
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,278
many little calculations in the paper

557
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:50,240
was uh how much land area would it take

558
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:52,919
to grow all of the Cannabis you know

559
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,120
24,000 tons roughly of cannabus that

560
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,440
Americans consume every year in the US

561
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:02,558
and the answer is

562
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,320
0.003% % 3,000 of 1% of all us Farmland

563
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,200
so you know we could clearly grow all

564
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,158
the Cannabis that Americans want and it

565
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,720
could all be uh you know in almost you

566
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:12,120
know the ideal climate I'm not saying

567
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,839
that's happening tomorrow you know

568
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:15,879
that's a whole hour about interstate

569
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,079
commerce and pros and cons of that and

570
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,600
so on but uh there is a kind of an

571
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:26,278
implicit you know requirement that it be

572
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:27,480
grown everywhere uh and that said um I

573
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:30,079
don't know I mean there is outdoor

574
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,400
cultivation in every State and I don't

575
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,519
you know Alaska you name it and I don't

576
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,320
know you know what the best producers in

577
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:40,839
each state look like but there is a lot

578
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:42,639
of room there um and I don't I'm not

579
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,639
aware that anyone has found like a

580
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,440
medical element that is only achievable

581
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,799
by indoor but maybe that's there and if

582
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,278
there's a need for medicine you know

583
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,558
these things are are all nuanced uh in

584
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,400
all spectrums and and if there's a

585
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,000
really a need that's demonstrated for

586
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,000
indoor uh for some particular reason you

587
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,599
know then that that should be looked at

588
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,919
and supported and then it goes to what

589
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,719
you were saying a minute ago so what do

590
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:07,038
we do here and how do we make that more

591
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,640
efficient because also you know it's

592
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,200
easy for me to say well in a perfect

593
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,840
world uh this cultivation more of this

594
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,640
cultivation would be outdoors than it is

595
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,240
now and and you know remember a lot of

596
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,038
cultivation not just at small you know

597
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,400
uh uh artisanal scales but at industrial

598
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,480
scales is outdoor already and I know

599
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,480
most of that's headed for oil but anyway

600
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,640
um there's which is a shame right like

601
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,640
it's it's really a shame that so much of

602
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,320
the outdoor is just air quotes just

603
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,880
headed for oil I mean o oil is Honorable

604
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:43,119
but but it's it's it's really amazing to

605
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:47,799
me that people um treat outdoor as such

606
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:50,398
a a a a mediocre commodity when when I

607
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,200
go down to California I'm only

608
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:54,199
interested in finding Northern

609
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,880
California regenerative outdoor to

610
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,759
purchase and they want to put all this

611
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,399
mass-produced indoor block on me and and

612
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,798
it's really surprising that that the

613
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:07,639
outdoor what I consider the higher

614
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,918
quality regenerative stuff is discounted

615
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,559
because people don't want it it

616
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:15,759
astonishes me how that market Dynamic

617
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:17,678
works yeah certainly you know one uh

618
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,919
participant in this whole ecosystem are

619
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,640
the bud tenders and their level of

620
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,559
literacy or interest in the relative

621
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,320
merits of the two in the carbon

622
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,398
footprint uh is you know small in almost

623
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,960
all cases and of course there's no

624
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:32,278
product labeling which is ironic right

625
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,278
there aren't many industries that have

626
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,640
as much product labeling the sense of

627
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:39,359
CBD profiles and THC and and and uh

628
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,159
differentiation on cultivars you know

629
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,959
you don't go to the market and and have

630
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:47,120
all the different uh you know uh types

631
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,278
of corn labeled by their cultivar uh or

632
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,239
you know there might be a little bit of

633
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:52,440
that so you know that's an issue I think

634
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,640
consumer awareness I mean we're getting

635
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,278
away from the technical into the human

636
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,559
and into the consumer level but you know

637
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:01,558
consumers are not aware you know that

638
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,720
one pre-roll emits you know 5,000 times

639
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,319
its weight in CO2 that one pre-roll is

640
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,159
like driving 65 miles in the best

641
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,200
plug-in hybrid that's out there that one

642
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:14,200
pre-roll is as much of a carbon

643
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,519
footprint as 300 cigarettes and um I

644
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,720
think things like that are you know

645
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,319
consumer awareness is important people

646
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,960
talk a lot about free markets and

647
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,079
markets functioning well and not needing

648
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,880
regulation well one of those assumptions

649
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,558
is that the consumers have perfect

650
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,880
information about everything and are

651
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:30,839
making decisions

652
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,720
with a full you know visibility of their

653
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:36,558
choices and so that's uh you know we're

654
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,038
we're straying from the quality issue I

655
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,960
guess it's still you know it's consumer

656
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:41,759
choice but there are a lot of attributes

657
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,480
and quality is one of them and you could

658
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:47,558
also argue that the environmental

659
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,360
footprint is an element of quality and a

660
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:51,720
given consumer could look at it that way

661
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,158
or they could not but without knowing

662
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,839
what it is have no choice to weigh it in

663
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,559
yeah and and you can't expect that they

664
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,038
all ever would like just like with

665
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:02,079
everything else I mean uh it's you know

666
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:06,359
consumers are not trying to optimize our

667
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:08,720
planet for environment um you asked uh

668
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,319
you know you asked a bit about you know

669
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,240
lighting and then going Beyond lighting

670
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,879
and and so let's say lighting is roughly

671
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,839
a third and your mileage may vary a lot

672
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,799
but uh you know there's heating there's

673
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,439
cooling uh dehumidification is huge you

674
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,278
know the plants are of course

675
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,000
transpiring and releasing a lot of

676
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,038
moisture and if you're growing

677
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,558
hydroponically uh there's a lot of water

678
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,558
coming out you know around on the plant

679
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,678
and that you know obviously creates a

680
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:36,879
big risk of of mold and and uh other

681
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,440
issues and so there's dehumidification

682
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,120
which is very energy intensive and then

683
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,120
you know moving air you know there can

684
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:47,558
be 30 40 50 60 air rotations in in an

685
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,839
indoor grow in in an hour you know by

686
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:53,759
for contrast a house has like one or two

687
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:56,639
or half of an air change per hour lot of

688
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,679
energy moving that air you're you're

689
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,200
irrigating you're have pumps you're uh

690
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,278
possibly treating that water you're

691
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,840
possibly heating that water or even

692
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,519
cooling that water depending what

693
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,119
climate you're in I bet down in coella

694
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,640
Valley they have cooler uh you know

695
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,319
water chillers that are chilling the

696
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,320
irrigation water and uh if you have your

697
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,918
own water supply you're pumping and uh

698
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,918
so just as far as energy uses and then

699
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,320
there's curing and then often there's

700
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,159
extraction on the site and then uh you

701
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,200
know there's a lot of cold storage now

702
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,720
in the industry there's you know vast

703
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,640
overproduction like vast p over

704
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,558
production in the industry it's more

705
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,960
well documented in Canada than here but

706
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:35,558
definitely happening here and so that

707
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,558
stuff is going into refrigerators and

708
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:38,879
freezers and I'm just saying like it's

709
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:40,798
it's back to the earlier Point there's

710
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,720
no Silver Bullet but all of these things

711
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,158
use energy and they all have Energy

712
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,079
Efficiency options you know they're all

713
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,519
manageable to a point and they should be

714
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,918
you know if they're used they should be

715
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,200
done as efficiently as possible and so

716
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,120
those are some of the ones that are in

717
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,919
my numbers there for people who are

718
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,558
concerned about oh Evans numbers are too

719
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,360
high

720
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,480
there's a heck of a lot of things I left

721
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:04,918
out because there were no good data you

722
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,519
know to include them and and there's a a

723
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,159
figure I think figure one in the paper

724
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:12,120
that kind of has this map of the the

725
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,559
whole kind of carbon uh system you know

726
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:15,959
around cannabis and which things I've

727
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,720
been able to quantify in which I haven't

728
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,679
but you know on there's you know in

729
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,798
energy there's you know managing your

730
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,919
carbon dioxide there's UV disinfection

731
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:26,158
these all things I couldn't include odor

732
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,600
removal uh not necessarily so much in

733
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,480
cannabis but you know in other indoor

734
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,278
egg which I'm also studying there's soil

735
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,000
steaming and cleaning soil to use again

736
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:37,640
there's recovering water out of your air

737
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,079
conditioning or your HVAC uh exhaust

738
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,440
stream uh in some climates there's snow

739
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,918
melting again that's more for other

740
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,919
crops but that really happens uh you've

741
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,919
got your infield farm equipment talking

742
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,759
about outdoor there's data people want

743
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,799
to use Ai and robots you know I mean

744
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,240
this industry is automating very rapidly

745
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,079
right again not at the small boutique

746
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,159
grower level but where most of the

747
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,439
cultivation happenings and and as we we

748
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,399
know you know AI uses a lot of energy

749
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,759
and and mechanization uses energy and

750
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:08,038
instead of human labor and you know the

751
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,278
list kind of goes on but just to say yes

752
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:12,359
there there is a lot of other energy use

753
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:14,558
besides lighting uh the good news is

754
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,119
that they all are manageable to one

755
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,079
degree or another in terms of of Energy

756
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,038
Efficiency I've got one more question

757
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,639
for you before we go to the first break

758
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:27,038
Evan and and that is you know you

759
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,519
mentioned early on um where moving from

760
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,240
traditional lights to LED lights is you

761
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,359
know it's it's good to move in the right

762
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,679
direction but it doesn't really move the

763
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,839
needle and um you know you guest gave us

764
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,200
a a healthy laundry list and and we'll

765
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,678
we'll we're going to dig into more of

766
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,679
those during the second set but um you

767
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,240
know you gave us a a laundry list of all

768
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:51,038
these other places that are uh energy

769
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:55,240
intensive in the indoor cultivation Zone

770
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:58,000
if I if we went and got the energy

771
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,880
efficient version of all of these the

772
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,558
the energy efficient you know water

773
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,679
cooler and the energy efficient um you

774
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,918
know lighting and the energy efficient

775
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,960
um you know Automation and if we just

776
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,480
went down the list and got them all yeah

777
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,440
would that move the needle or are we

778
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,480
just kidding ourselves it would but it

779
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,679
won't because it would but it won't yeah

780
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,880
because uh yes you can kind of uh play

781
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,960
God in the sense of specifying all this

782
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,000
stuff and then we haven't even talked

783
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,519
about solar yet and you know you could

784
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
make a zero energy grow

785
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:35,880
but the the obstacles to that the the

786
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,919
resistance in the market itself is

787
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,360
enormous I mean the the surveys the

788
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,080
market surveys done of The Growers say

789
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,319
they want about a three-year payback

790
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,558
time on any Capital Investments more

791
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,638
than half of them want a three-year

792
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:50,638
payback time or less so you can't even

793
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:52,079
though that's 33% of return on your

794
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:54,398
investment I wish I could get that in

795
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,079
the bank uh that's not going to get you

796
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,599
far at all there was a big study that

797
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,599
came out in Canada and there's been a

798
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:04,119
few that have tried to look you know we

799
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:05,519
call it kind of technoeconomic studies

800
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,719
you know how about this technology how

801
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,278
much does this cost how much to save

802
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,679
payback and they're getting numbers like

803
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,679
you know 10 to 20% Energy savings

804
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,840
potential in cannabis grows again you

805
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,080
can't just pick lighting right I mean

806
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,278
LED is hard enough to get it to pencil

807
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,839
but you know you have to look at all

808
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,839
these end uses and so you know while

809
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:27,638
there may be a technical potential for

810
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,839
let's just say 75% Energy savings which

811
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:34,240
is what I stipulated in 2012 in the

812
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:37,720
first paper um no one who is trying to

813
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,278
earn a profit you know who has investors

814
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,960
is going to ever be able to get anywhere

815
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:45,880
near that and so and then with solar the

816
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,240
problem is that the land use becomes

817
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,679
untenable uh I'm doing analysis now uh

818
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,759
it's looking like cannabis facilities

819
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,960
depending on climate and um location but

820
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,240
sorry climate and facility type and like

821
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,360
you said you know people want to grow in

822
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,919
harsh climates right because they want

823
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,319
to grow in their state or in their town

824
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,960
so it can be as bad or even worse than a

825
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:11,839
100 times the roof area in solar and you

826
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,798
know the best I've seen are like 20

827
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,398
times the roof area or maybe 10 times

828
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:17,798
the roof area and so all of a sudden

829
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,158
you're using more

830
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:23,038
land than you would be with outdoor

831
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,600
cultivation and and land sparing or land

832
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,798
savings is one of the top you know

833
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:31,038
arguments that are used for uh indoor

834
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,319
agriculture more more generally so there

835
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,398
are these kind of real world

836
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,960
inconvenient you know constraints around

837
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,119
it and meanwhile the industry is

838
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,919
opposing not opposing that's not fair

839
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,678
but you know like the California energy

840
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,960
commission was putting out uh public

841
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,639
comment requests for Energy Efficiency

842
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,079
standards on indoor grows and the

843
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:51,398
industry comes out of the woodwork with

844
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,439
all kinds of opposition to it you know

845
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:55,278
and and the uptake of LED is still

846
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,720
pretty low to be honest you know in the

847
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:00,759
market and so it's uh it's hard you know

848
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,399
it's got to be done willingly or ideally

849
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,119
it's done willingly and if it's not not

850
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,119
done willingly then The Regulators come

851
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:07,798
in and people don't want any more

852
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,960
regulation on cannabis but they won't do

853
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:14,239
it on their own enough you know uh so

854
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,039
it's it's rough uh and so I use the the

855
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,199
term uh optimizing the suboptimal yes

856
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,358
you can optimize these things you can do

857
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,918
better and and Lord knows people are I

858
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,918
mean I'm not here to criticize and say

859
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,279
the industry is not doing anything the

860
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:30,519
LED look their heat pumps are coming in

861
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,679
people are you know trying to use Ai and

862
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:35,599
things to optimize Water application

863
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,599
minimize water use and therefore pumping

864
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,399
energy so there efforts are being made

865
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,119
uh but it's just uh you're not getting

866
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:46,638
that far and uh so we're optimizing the

867
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:48,879
the suboptimal it's so much more elegant

868
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,079
technologically and economically to grow

869
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,118
outdoors uh if you can address the

870
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,359
quality issue and and still do that

871
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,079
sustainably because there's plenty of

872
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,519
inputs you know to outdoor cultivation

873
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,320
all right so hold on that because I'm

874
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:02,960
going to pick up on inputs in the second

875
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,559
set but but I I want you to follow up on

876
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,720
one thing before we go to commercial

877
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,440
which is uh earlier in the set I I said

878
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:11,959
okay if we if we do if we change

879
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,720
everything to the energy efficient

880
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,679
version will it move the needle and and

881
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:20,838
and and and it and is is the technology

882
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,679
in LED just not um up to the standard

883
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:24,838
yet and we're about to so we can just

884
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,118
research our way out of this I have this

885
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:30,279
same question about the solar panels

886
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,838
because um solar has always been one of

887
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,480
my things that will save indoors in my

888
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:39,199
head right um without being a solar nerd

889
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,679
just hoping hoping that to be the case

890
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:45,399
and um do we see technological

891
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,759
advances that are coming down the pipe

892
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,760
in research that might be able to

893
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,960
increase our efficiency so it wouldn't

894
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,640
take 20 to 30X the the roof space in

895
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,519
solar panels to feed a cultivation

896
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:03,480
Center or or are are are we not um

897
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:06,000
foreseeing that in any kind of immediate

898
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,920
future yeah I don't not in our lifetimes

899
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,199
and not not even in a longer time frame

900
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,358
not not sufficient at all I mean LED is

901
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,078
incredibly efficient yeah they're still

902
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:16,358
working on it I mean solar is incredibly

903
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,720
efficient the best panels are you know

904
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:20,799
there's been huge progress it'll

905
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,679
continue but it's not it's not of this

906
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,200
the magnitude that you need you know

907
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:26,919
you've got factors of 10 and factors of

908
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,159
100 improvements you need here I think

909
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,800
there other domain like strain see there

910
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:34,358
I go uh genetics cultivar uh huge

911
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,160
differences you know actually that

912
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:39,358
figure five in the paper shows just the

913
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,440
energy use for different cultivars and

914
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,598
that's an area where you might get 50%

915
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,960
savings or 50% increase you know

916
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,559
depending where you're moving between so

917
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,318
you know there there's also a broader

918
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,400
array of possible uh things to do rather

919
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:56,239
than changing One widget for another you

920
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,559
know in your growing process uh that

921
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,318
that's something to uh you know to to

922
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,199
look at excellent all right so let's go

923
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:04,759
ahead and take a short break and we'll

924
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,838
be right back you are listening to

925
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,160
shaping fire and my guest today is

926
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,440
energy and environmental systems analyst

927
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:11,440
Evan

928
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,560
Mills you've heard me talk about the

929
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,480
award-winning cannabis seeds that come

930
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:19,358
from the analytical breeding program of

931
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,519
Seth and Eric Crawford who founded

932
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:25,199
Oregon CBD seeds in fact Seth was a

933
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:28,119
guest on shaping fire in 2020 to talk

934
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,559
about triploid genetics Seth and Eric

935
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,960
are now releasing high THC seeds for

936
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:37,639
homeg Growers and Farms as grow the

937
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,599
revolution seeds at GTR seeds.com their

938
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:43,118
high THC seeds are extraordinary in that

939
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:45,559
they will start to flower at 16 1/2

940
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,599
hours of daylight instead of the typical

941
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:50,880
14 1/2 hours of daylight that means in

942
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,440
most regions your plants will start to

943
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,559
flower out doors in the middle of July

944
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,639
instead of the middle of August which

945
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,639
means these photo period plants finished

946
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:03,400
in September and not October totally

947
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,598
upending the photo period Seed Market

948
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,280
Seth and Eric took their prized early

949
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,800
flowering CBG line and bred it to some

950
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,480
of the most desired verified genetics

951
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,119

00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,440
boast one toone THC to thcv and people

959
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,318
want that

960
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,480
thcv GTR seeds are very consistent true

inbred parent lines these seeds are

963
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,119
nearly homogeneous and the plants should

964
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:52,719
all grow the same there is only one

run revenue is tight for cannabis

976
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,159
businesses right now there is no

977
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,239
question about it and when Revenue

978
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,318
tightens businesses need to spend

979
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,118
Smarter on Advertising

980
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:31,838
instead of throwing obscene money at

981
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,318
Hanging your company's logo from the

982
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:36,400
rafters at your next convention perhaps

983
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:38,759
consider placing commercials on shaping

984
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,920
fire and if you are a very small

985
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,400
business there is simply no better bang

986
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,880
for your buck than commercials on

987
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,119
shaping fire especially if your products

988
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,480

989
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,280
cultivators advertising on this show

990

991
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,359
product service or brand in a way that

992
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,919
really lets people know what sets your

993
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,838
company apart from the others bold

994
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,480

995
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,078

1002
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,598
whizbang smok and mirrors nowadays I

1003
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,480

1004
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,760
spoken to calmly accurately and with

1005

welcome back you are listening to

1079
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,440
shaping fire I am your host Shango Los

1080
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,358
and my guest today is energy and

1081
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,440
environmental systems analyst Evan Mills

1082
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:32,519
so at the end of last set we were

1083
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,240
talking about the um all the different

1084
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:39,079
places that energy usage can be tamped

1085
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:42,159
down or stopped in an indoor cultivation

1086
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:45,119
environment and um you know I have heard

1087
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:48,399
people push back before Evan and say we

1088
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:52,079
love cannabis it makes life livable why

1089
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,000
are you harassing cannabis cultivation

1090
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,559
when there are so many other things um

1091
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,760
that we should be harping on and I I

1092
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,480
know there's a logical fallacy there

1093
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,280
because the F the fact that we should be

1094
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,199
doing something about energy in a

1095
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,880
different sector doesn't really say

1096
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,679
anything about not doing it in our

1097
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,760
sector except for the fact that we all

1098
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,399
love cannabis right um but I've heard I

1099
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,880
bet you've heard this quite a bit and

1100
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,440
and what do you say when people push

1101
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,318
back like

1102
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:25,280
that yeah I I say that that it's and not

1103
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:26,800
or you know we just like you there's 20

1104
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,760
ways to save energy in a house there's

1105
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,240
also 20 ways to save energy in an

1106
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,520
economy or on a planet and we need you

1107
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:36,799
know we need to reduce carbon dioxide

1108
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:39,440
emissions by 90% or more on this planet

1109
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,960
to save ourselves you know and you can't

1110
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,280
do that with one thing you can't do that

1111
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,480
just going after cars or steel making

1112
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,960
you know it's just it's got to be it's

1113
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,079
got to be taking every opportunity and

1114
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,280
the you know the dirty secret is that

1115
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,160
cannabis is actually benefiting from a

1116
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,640
double standard you know it's it's

1117
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:59,279
arguably one of the last Industries to

1118
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:01,879
come to Energy Efficiency and

1119
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,040
sustainable energy because you know by

1120
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:08,079
virtue of the illicit Market history it

1121
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:10,599
hasn't been uh exposed to or eligible

1122
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,240
for you know energy tax credits or

1123
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:16,720
energy education even or utility rebates

1124
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:18,799
uh and the you know the stealthy nature

1125
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,838
of it uh you know and the low

1126
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,318
capitalization doesn't provide the money

1127
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:25,679
to invest you know those days are gone

1128
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:28,079
and you know in California where I live

1129
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,719
excuse me in California where I live

1130
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,160
it's uh you know it's been a quarter of

1131
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:34,318
a century since we've had you know legal

1132
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,078
medical and since cultivation been done

1133
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,639
legally we've had a lot of time the

1134
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,920
industry's had a lot of time to figure

1135
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:43,199
out how to do this well so um I don't

1136
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,760
know if that that helps but those are

1137
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,199
those are some thoughts I think it also

1138
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,640
matters in aggregate you know if this

1139
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:52,279
was a tiny tiny amount of energy tiny

1140
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:54,199
tiny then yeah okay why it shouldn't be

1141
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,839
a priority I mean we've only got limited

1142
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:57,679
time limited money but it's really

1143
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:02,440
stunning how how big it is and how big

1144
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:04,199
it's become in my since my 2012 study

1145
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,639
the consumption of cannabis in the

1146
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:08,358
United States has tripled so the

1147
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:12,039
cultivation has tripled it's even more

1148
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:14,159
than tripled for subtle reasons but the

1149
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,239
so the the energy use now because I in

1150
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,799
the paper you know I look at the per

1151
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,318
square foot or per kilogram more

1152
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,000
importantly you know energy use but I

1153
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:24,480
also look at the macro the national

1154
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,039
level and the carbon footprint now today

1155
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,199
even including all these uses that I've

1156
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:31,558
left out is equal to that of 6 million

1157
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:34,480
homes 6 million average American Homes

1158
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:39,519
10 million average American cars it's

1159
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:42,719
more than than um crypto mining wow it's

1160
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:44,400
four times I mean I was stn I had to

1161
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,519
more than crypto mining because we're

1162
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,880
all hearing about crypto mining uh

1163
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:50,159
inputs and and and our cannabis is more

1164
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,599
and and so it's part of that double

1165
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:55,159
standard it it's gotten less attention

1166
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:57,000
than it merits not more I would argue

1167
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:59,318
and the other thing that was stunning is

1168
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,079
that it's four times the energy use of

1169
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:02,558
the pharmaceutical and Medicine

1170
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,440
manufacturing

1171
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,640
sector and so putting all other

1172
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,800
commentary and things aside as a

1173
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:12,719
medicine you you know that needs to be

1174
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,559
owned you know that needs to be owned

1175
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,639
it's four times the food and beverage

1176
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,000
industry which manufacturing these are

1177
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,879
National statistics from the US

1178
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,519
Department of energy uh and that

1179
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,400
includes beer and wine production food

1180
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:26,440
and beverage and it's the same as this

1181
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,519
one is stunning like it's the same as

1182
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,400
all outdoor food crop

1183
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:35,400
production how can that be wait all wa

1184
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,079
whoa whoa it is equal to all of the food

1185
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,519
crop production in the United States all

1186
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:42,200
of it yeah that's an

1187
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,079
absurd comparison because that's that's

1188
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:48,799
outdoors I mean only 1% of the Cannabis

1189
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:50,880
carbon footprint is due to outdoor

1190
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,839
cannabis cultivation right so it's the

1191
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,880
indoor I mean I'm doing my next papers

1192
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:56,159
on indoor growing of cucumbers and

1193
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,720
tomatoes and lettuce and all the other

1194
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,239
food props there a problem too not

1195
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:02,318
nearly as bad as cannabis but they're

1196
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,879
you know hundreds of times more energy

1197
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,759
than outdoor lettuce production outdoor

1198
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,200
tomatoes and so on so it's just the

1199
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,160
energy intensity is so extraordinary and

1200
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,199
outdoor cultivation you know it uses

1201
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:14,639
relatively little energy per acre I mean

1202
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,159
you've got your tractors and your water

1203
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,199
pumps and a lot of food doesn't require

1204
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:21,879
you know drying or curing and you

1205
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,719
there's lots of reasons why that is um

1206
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,000
but cannabis is 300 times at least as

1207
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:30,358
much energy as indoor lettuce is so it's

1208
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,960
just a lot more energy intensive and you

1209
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:33,639
know and then for the those are big like

1210
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,760
abstract numbers I mean they're helpful

1211
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:38,318
because they're in contact I think the

1212
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,160
comparisons actually help more they do

1213
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:43,639
so then the like to to thicken that

1214
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:45,679
broth I also look at just to help this

1215
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:47,519
be accessible you know or put in

1216
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,039
perspective uh what about from the

1217
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,798
consumer perspective I mentioned a

1218
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,039
little bit before about cars and driving

1219
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:54,400
here's another one if you look at the

1220
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,279
know different tiers of consumers

1221
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,559
obviously so you look at the daily or

1222
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,280
near day user which is like I don't know

1223
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:04,440
15 million people or something in the

1224
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,920
states um their carbon footprint if they

1225
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,280
consumed just indoor grown at average US

1226
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,079
conditions outdoor grown it's a

1227
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,319
different story they consumed indoor

1228
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,280
grown their carbon footprint from their

1229
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,679
cannabis consumption is half of the

1230
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,400
carbon footprint of their entire home

1231
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,879
meaning their fridge their cooking their

1232
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,280
Heating and their Cooling in average US

1233
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:27,960
conditions it's like three CrossCountry

1234
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:31,920
road trips per year in in a plug-in

1235
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,559
hybrid it's like 100% of their annual

1236
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,519
food consumption so if you look at the

1237
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:38,240
energy footprint in their other food

1238
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,239
including meat eaters it's roughly on

1239
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,318
par with the carbon footprint of their

1240
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:44,199
food consumption and we're just talking

1241
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,639
about you know a couple of grams few

1242
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:48,838
grams whatever a day of of cannabis and

1243
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:51,239
it's not much better if you're a healthy

1244
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:52,838
uh uh healthy vegan or vegetarian but

1245
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:56,399
it's you know the the difference is is

1246
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:58,759
even greater um so it's just it matters

1247
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,760
you know and and we can't we have to do

1248
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,079
everything it's an all Hands-On deck

1249
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,319
climate emergency you know and so we

1250
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:08,160
just need to look at everything and it's

1251
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:09,318
not you know blaming and making bad it's

1252
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:10,879
you know more in the spirit of what you

1253
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:12,960
were saying before how do we do better

1254
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,559
what where are the inefficiencies and

1255
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,599
where where can we be more um you know

1256
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:21,200
have a a lower smaller footprint in in

1257
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,880
this industry I want to Pivot uh a bit

1258
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:26,279
until to to start talking about post

1259
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,680
Harvest um because like you said we

1260
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,200
could spend hours going through a

1261
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:34,199
detailed checklist of all of the

1262
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:37,519
different um parts of cultivation where

1263
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:40,838
we could um uh strategize differently or

1264
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:44,880
use different technology but um it's

1265
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:47,558
it's arguably just as ugly after um the

1266
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,519
flower has been dried and cured and is

1267
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:52,319
on its way out the door too um one of

1268
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:53,798
the things that you know I'm not it's

1269
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,239
not like I'm the only one but but but

1270
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:59,159
one my big pet peeves are Dube tubes and

1271
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:01,479
the the idea that we're we're you know

1272
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:04,199
creating all these Plastics and future

1273
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,358
micr Plastics and and then if it's a

1274
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:11,239
it's a if it's a really highend maybe a

1275
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:13,838
a hash infused or something um uh

1276
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:15,479
pre-roll or canar then then they're

1277
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,440
adding extra stuff like they're they're

1278
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,599
adding plastic based sticker and then

1279
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,318
like some kind of like

1280
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:27,119
um cool seal and and then maybe even a

1281
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:29,239
box around the outside right abely and

1282
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,480
and it's like there's only you know

1283
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:33,318
there's only a gram or to a weed inside

1284
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,440
that joint and there's all this

1285
00:51:33,318 --> 00:51:39,519
packaging to give it Vibe so that it

1286
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,679
sells and um I I imagine that the

1287
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:45,318
packaging is just ugly in the

1288
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:48,558
numbers yeah there is a new paper I know

1289
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:49,880
out about that in in particular and it's

1290
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,640
you know I looked at the solid waist

1291
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,920
streams I mean a lot of that is is just

1292
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:56,199
plant residue but it's also you know

1293
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,358
spent mineral wool and it's the plastics

1294
00:51:56,199 --> 00:52:00,719
for the cultivation and it was like I

1295
00:51:58,358 --> 00:52:02,759
think 15 times the weight of the flower

1296
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,639
or something and just that Solid Waste

1297
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,359
part uh you mentioned Vape cartridges

1298
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:11,118
and the like and you know one thing

1299
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:14,078
that's uh so sad there is that Vapes

1300
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,079
have tiny lithium batteries in them and

1301
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,559
they go to the landfill and lithium is

1302
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,798
recyclable and reusable and we have a

1303
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,000
crisis and a lot of the you know also

1304
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:24,599
the uh people on the right you know like

1305
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,079
to say that you know lithium is hurting

1306
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,960
the environment and electric cars are

1307
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,760
bad and so so on and the reality is we

1308
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,920
can recover and reuse our lithium and

1309
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,240
that radically reduces the environmental

1310
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,159
footprint of lithium but we don't want

1311
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:36,759
to be sending it into the landfills

1312
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:38,960
there are actually landfill fires that

1313
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,040
are starting now because of all the The

1314
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,720
Vape concentrations and probably other

1315
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,000
lithium batteries too but there if you

1316
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:47,558
Google lithium fires landfill you'll

1317
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,239
you'll find uh that that's happening

1318
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:50,839
just saying and they're nice and evenly

1319
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:54,959
distributed throughout the landfill

1320
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:57,119
right yeah so it is a problem uh I think

1321
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,280
you you missed a couple of important

1322
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,960
ones I mean there there's all the solid

1323
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,280
let's call it broadly solid waste and

1324
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,159
what is the carbon footprint of that and

1325
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,640
some of that's included in the paper and

1326
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:07,719
there's certainly other literature you

1327
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:10,279
know as a whole discipline of looking at

1328
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:12,480
life cycle assessment uh but uh there's

1329
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,359
a kind of a gray zone between

1330
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,960
cultivation proper and putting it on the

1331
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:23,199
truck and that's again like I mentioned

1332
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:25,960
before Refrigeration curing and also uh

1333
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:28,919
Downstream of that is extraction and

1334
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:31,240
that is huge area that we know almost

1335
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,880
nothing about be it just hasn't been

1336
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:35,798
studied and written about I really tried

1337
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,680
to bring that into the analysis and I

1338
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:39,440
think it will be coming I I know some

1339
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,679
people who are trying to do more

1340
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,358
research on that now uh but I did do one

1341
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:47,039
vignette that's in the supporting

1342
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:48,920
appendix of my report you can get online

1343
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:50,480
it's not in the National numbers because

1344
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,200
I don't know on scale but I looked at

1345
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,599
Super critical CO2 which was the one

1346
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,719
extraction process I could find

1347
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:01,760
information on and it was was stunning

1348
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:04,719
um about uh the CO2 footprint from the

1349
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:09,119
extraction process was about 50 times

1350
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:11,159
the weight of the flour so 50 kg of CO2

1351
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:16,400
to the atmosphere per kilogram of flour

1352
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:18,399
going into the process and that um that

1353
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,440
you know is about actually it's more

1354
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,639
than that I'm sorry it's about 150 times

1355
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,400
uh but it depends so if you look at like

1356
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:29,239
what is that as a fraction of indoor

1357
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,960
footprint it's like a 10% increase 10%

1358
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:32,838
Adder to the footprint we are talking

1359
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,920
about but if you look at outdoor it's

1360
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:37,318
30% increase right because outdoor less

1361
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,200
less carbon intensive those are

1362
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:41,880
percentages but it is arguably an

1363
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:44,879
outdoor grower can make a bigger

1364
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,440
marginal footprint on their you know

1365
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,240
impact impact on their footprint by

1366
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,559
extraction and and we just don't know I

1367
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:53,279
mean there's so many processes and we

1368
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,920
don't know the the national magnitudes

1369
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,319
but it's something that's just crying

1370
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,599
out for uh being looked at it's not more

1371
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:01,639
important than the things we're talking

1372
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:03,480
about but again everything matters um so

1373
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:05,920
I don't know if those are helpful kind

1374
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,318
of conversations be you know to address

1375
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,920
your your question I'm happy to keep

1376
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:13,400
going yeah it is uh I I I would like us

1377
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:18,480
to uh move a little bit further down the

1378
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:21,760
chain um to um so what it's gr and it's

1379
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,798
stored and it is extracted and it is

1380
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,000
packaged all things that we've hit on so

1381
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:29,639
far but let's let's pick it up from that

1382
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,119
point so um uh at this point we're in

1383
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:34,279
transportation so why don't you pick up

1384
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,119
the storyline there yeah so it's it's

1385
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,760
harder to look at Transportation because

1386
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,960
again data you know one thing vexing

1387
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,599
this whole process is there's no you

1388
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,559
know as a result of national

1389
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,440
criminalization and whatever else where

1390
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:47,640
funding is there's there's not nearly as

1391
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,079
good a data on cannabis industry as

1392
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:52,078
there are on other Industries and and of

1393
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,960
course part of that problem is also the

1394
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,200
industry itself not sharing you know its

1395
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,280
data but you know there there are

1396
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,519
numbers out there and ways to look at it

1397
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,960
and so I do look at that in the paper

1398
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,480
and it's uh you know there's lots of

1399
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,960
Transportation going on right through

1400
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,559
the whole life cycle I mean there's

1401
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,519
upfront transportation in the building

1402
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,119
of the facility of course in the

1403
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,239
delivery of all the inputs the

1404
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:15,760
fertilizers the the Plastics the Clones

1405
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:17,519
the whatever uh and then there's people

1406
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,720
working and coming to and fro there's

1407
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,679
landfill so these things are broken out

1408
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:23,519
you know in the report and then like you

1409
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,919
said at the end of course it goes into a

1410
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:28,719
distribution chain and uh some people

1411
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,798
have complained about the regulatory

1412
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,358
landscape making this worse because

1413
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,480
cannabis and that's is going to vary you

1414
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:36,798
know by state and by jurisdiction right

1415
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,000
but the more times you have to move it

1416
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:41,358
because of chain of not chain of custody

1417
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,400
but like the way the the uh stewardship

1418
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:45,400
you know is is dictated uh it may have

1419
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,920
to go to to one level of distribution

1420
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,680
and then to another and certain uh

1421
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,039
processes in the in the uh product life

1422
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:53,838
cycle are separated to different

1423
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:55,359
locations whatnot but there's

1424
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,558
Transportation there and like one one

1425
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:58,960
emerging thing that I just mentioned but

1426
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:00,880
there's no you know I couldn't get a

1427
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,318
handle on it with numbers is uh

1428
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,838
door-to-door delivery I mean if you want

1429
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,838
to really look you know at the whole

1430
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,440
ecosystem you have to look at how it

1431
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:10,279
reaches consumer that's the life cycle

1432
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,318
and uh certainly door-to-door delivery

1433
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,839
is increasing what is the net effect I

1434
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:16,639
don't know I mean you can argue uh that

1435
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:18,719
it might save some energy and certainly

1436
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:20,358
it's going to defay some consumer trips

1437
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,439
but you know there's a lot of talk now

1438
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:24,239
about the faster that people want their

1439
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,519
delivery the more carbon footprint there

1440
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:28,358
is cu they send single items out in a

1441
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:30,000
giant truck and you know we've all had

1442
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:31,679
the experience with Amazon and you order

1443
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,639
something and it's at your door the next

1444
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:36,159
day and that means you know there were a

1445
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:37,598
lot of inefficiencies in getting that to

1446
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:39,920
your door because they're not they're

1447
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,680
not moving Goods large amounts of goods

1448
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,880
in one trip to one ZIP code they're

1449
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:46,159
they're racing around with it one piece

1450
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,760
of data you dropped that astonished me

1451
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:51,759
was that home delivery is 50% of

1452
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,520
cannabis sales now and and you know I I

1453
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,880
I've never had delivery not that I

1454
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:59,920
wouldn't have it but I live on on Island

1455
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,039
that's small in the PES sound right and

1456
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,519
and but but I I was astonished that

1457
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:07,880
there's so much of it just being

1458
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:09,719
delivered um and and you know I kind of

1459
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,838
I kind of simmered on this I'm like okay

1460
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:15,199
so the the cannabis store is sing

1461
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:17,400
sending somebody to me with my cannabis

1462
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:20,318
but but in the old days I used to go to

1463
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:24,480
the house of my dealer and so one way or

1464
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:26,920
another somebody had to drive and so um

1465
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,440
I can see how we put this on the

1466
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,159
industry as a whole but to be fair I

1467
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,760
don't I don't think we should we need to

1468
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:35,038
it'd be fair to put that on indoor no I

1469
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,799
agreed and I tried to be careful in

1470
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:38,200
saying what is the net effect of this

1471
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:40,239
because you have to look at the net

1472
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:41,798
effect and you know the the what is the

1473
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:44,719
alternative and is that more or less

1474
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:46,358
carbon and and we don't know uh but

1475
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:50,838
again if something you know if you're

1476
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:53,400
taking a 2,000lb car to deliver you know

1477
00:58:50,838 --> 00:58:55,599
an eighth somewhere and that's your only

1478
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,160
trip that you're making as opposed to a

1479
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,280
person who was ideally integrating that

1480
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,759
with some other trip and there's

1481
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,480
obviously a difference but I don't know

1482
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,640
also just a small correction so that 50%

1483
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,159
that's a thought experiment in the paper

1484
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:09,078
to see well what effect would that be

1485
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:10,679
and that would I if we got to 50% we

1486
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:12,079
don't know what share I don't know what

1487
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:13,480
share somebody does that's a good

1488
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,680
clarification so there's a lot of

1489
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,920
scenarios in the paper the the uh the

1490
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:18,358
policy scenarios and the market

1491
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,200
scenarios saying well what if the market

1492
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:22,440
evolved in this way or that way good or

1493
00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:25,159
bad just how much do certain things move

1494
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,880
the needle so that one like if 50% of

1495
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:29,159
sales were eventually conveyed by

1496
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,000
delivery services total emissions would

1497
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:33,440
go up by about 4% okay from the total

1498
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,318
carbon footprint so it's not the end of

1499
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,318
the world this isn't you know the big

1500
00:59:35,318 --> 00:59:39,038
knob at all but we just have to look at

1501
00:59:37,318 --> 00:59:40,358
all these things and and also like which

1502
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:41,799
ones are big and which ones are small

1503
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:44,400
and the only way to do that is to go

1504
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:46,838
through you know exercises like this so

1505
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,318
deliver is not in my study in in the in

1506
00:59:46,838 --> 00:59:50,759
the numbers because we don't know uh how

1507
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:54,038
much of it's going

1508
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:56,039
onif how much is saved by uh what the

1509
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:57,920
difference is between individual consum

1510
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:58,839
consumers going and getting it or of

1511
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,760
course there's the whole home

1512
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:02,798
cultivation part of this as well which

1513
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,440
is its whole you know separate

1514
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:06,838
discussion and that's included in the

1515
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,200
study and and there you you know you

1516
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:10,358
save a lot of emissions and so the if

1517
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,118
I'm remembering right the home

1518
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:14,038
cultivation is about half the carbon

1519
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:15,480
footprint indoor cultivation is

1520
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:17,960
something like half the carbon footprint

1521
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,798
of of industrial uh for a lot of reasons

1522
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,480
and one of them is you you you know you

1523
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:24,318
have less Transportation going on uh you

1524
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,159
have you know you're not landfilling

1525
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:28,719
things like that well that's an

1526
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:31,440
interesting spin Evan that I did not

1527
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:33,318
pick up my first time through um that's

1528
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,119
actually a decent I you know I live in

1529
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:37,318
Washington where we're not allowed hom

1530
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,200
grow we're like one of the only people

1531
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:42,759
yeah and um you know the the fact that

1532
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:46,759
it never occurred to me that that

1533
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:50,520
individual home you know a 4x4 tent hom

1534
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:53,839
grow is going to be more efficient for

1535
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:57,280
my own cannabis needs than it is for me

1536
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,239
to buy it from uh from a store and all

1537
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,559
the

1538
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,358
extra energy that's used by that

1539
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:05,519
cultivation I usually just compare it

1540
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:08,480
the the indoor that I would buy at the

1541
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:12,079
store versus my outdoor but the idea

1542
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,719
that my indoor um is more energy

1543
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,880
efficient surprises me can you tease

1544
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:18,719
that out a little bit more yeah sure so

1545
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,960
so let's be sure to say can be can be

1546
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,919
fair enough okay the devil's always in

1547
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,519
the details uh but uh and and still from

1548
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,159
my numbers it's still still about half

1549
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:32,960
the carbon footprint which is still

1550
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:35,078
2,000 times its weight in CO2 so you

1551
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,240
know keep it in perspective it's an

1552
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:37,400
improvement I mean there we go back to

1553
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,199
your conversations it's like well what

1554
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,160
can we do you know and so this is

1555
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,480
something ostensibly that would make a

1556
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:44,798
big dent in it but you're still left

1557
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,719
with a problem you know that's

1558
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:50,440
extraordinary um but the reasons are you

1559
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:52,199
know not everybody's air conditioning um

1560
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,880
there's less volume you know these

1561
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:55,199
indoor grows as you see you know in the

1562
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,599
big pictures the industrial ones they're

1563
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,358
incredibly voluminous and so you're you

1564
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,720
know you're not just lighting plants

1565
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:02,880
you're Heating and Cooling and

1566
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:06,798
dehumidifying you know giant volumes of

1567
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:08,200
air so you know that's a factor um the

1568
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:10,480
you know it also depends on the

1569
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:12,879
efficiency like if you know you're using

1570
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,599
a heat pump at home and the indoor

1571
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,559
grower Greenhouse is using gas heating

1572
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,440
that's at 80% efficiency uh you know

1573
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,278
that makes a difference uh you don't

1574
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,480
have the interdiction or at least to the

1575
01:02:22,278 --> 01:02:26,239
same level and you know interdiction I

1576
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,400
mean there's a lot of work up front in

1577
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,038
this paper of looking at how much is

1578
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,039
grown versus how much makes it to the

1579
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:33,799
market because what doesn't make it to

1580
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:35,839
the market I'm not really changing the

1581
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:37,358
subject but you know it's a part where

1582
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:40,960
it's a part of this indoor grown thing

1583
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:43,199
again it's colorful right and so you

1584
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:47,079
know you have to take all the energy

1585
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:48,919
used to cultivate and divide that by the

1586
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:50,960
energy by the quantity of cannabis

1587
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,240
consumed at the end of the day right

1588
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,480
that's the carbon footprint you have to

1589
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:58,519
count all the energy whether it ends up

1590
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:00,760
in a given consumer's product or not

1591
01:02:58,519 --> 01:03:02,798
because that's CO2 to the atmosphere and

1592
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,960
energy being used and so you know you've

1593
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:08,119
got so many forms of loss including at

1594
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:10,960
home I mean if you lose a crop because

1595
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:12,640
you're you're not skilled you know and

1596
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,358
all of a sudden you're 4x4 is full of

1597
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:19,519
mold you just wasted you know 60 days of

1598
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:21,558
of electricity to get there but also you

1599
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:23,719
know there's like the product testing

1600
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:25,319
which again I'm not I'm not against but

1601
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:26,838
product testing results in destroyed

1602
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:29,318
cannabis and you're not product testing

1603
01:03:26,838 --> 01:03:30,798
when you grow at home uh the the

1604
01:03:29,318 --> 01:03:32,519
transport some of the transportation

1605
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:34,679
involved there's no dispensary being lit

1606
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:36,038
up I mean that's a small contri oh that

1607
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:40,000
was a nice pun did you get that one yeah

1608
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:41,920
I got that um so those are some

1609
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,519
factors uh not everyone has

1610
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,798
dehumidification you know you don't have

1611
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,719
the large amounts of moisture all being

1612
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:51,400
concentrated maybe you dry it in your

1613
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:52,798
shower and you don't have showers off uh

1614
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,358
you don't have you know an electric

1615
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:57,559
drying uh environment with dehumidifiers

1616
01:03:55,358 --> 01:04:00,159
running so you know it's those are the

1617
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:01,798
kinds of reasons why it seems like the

1618
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,838
home footprint and then you're not going

1619
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:06,719
to landfill you know the laws that

1620
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:09,558
require and you know I'm not the laws

1621
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:12,038
that require landfilling also increase

1622
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:14,079
carbon emissions it's very small very

1623
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:16,240
very small but I had to calculate it and

1624
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,720
just look and when you put a lot of

1625
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:22,078
biomass under the ground especially if

1626
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:26,159
you have uh wet you know soaked mineral

1627
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:28,079
wool full of full of uh uh P um

1628
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:29,519
fertilizer residues and roots and so on

1629
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,720
you get methane you know and that's a

1630
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:32,960
greenhouse gas and lands are not not

1631
01:04:31,719 --> 01:04:35,239
catching all the methane so anyway

1632
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,599
that's not happening with with home

1633
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:39,558
cultivation uh as long as you compost it

1634
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,400
and it doesn't go anerobic you know

1635
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:44,599
you're okay that is an interesting thing

1636
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,920
you said about interdiction um you know

1637
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:50,680
raising the uh the energy consumption of

1638
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:53,480
overall cannabis because um they're like

1639
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:55,919
hey it was it was grown and and if they

1640
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:58,960
just take it and let it mold in some

1641
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,000
closet somewhere um that that it's not

1642
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,119
getting it's not meeting needs in the

1643
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,719
market and so it's they're essentially

1644
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,200
letting electricity usage mold and so so

1645
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,759
interdiction is not good for the

1646
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:13,000
environment is a catchy idea and it's

1647
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:15,000
not yeah and it's not just uh

1648
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,960
electricity it's the fossil fuel but

1649
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,480
it's also it's also all the but and

1650
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,400
Beyond energy it's all the other inputs

1651
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,000
uh you know to make the fertilizers and

1652
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,760
build the facilities you you have to

1653
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,719
allocate all that energy somewhere so uh

1654
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,319
and the same token uh you know product

1655
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,959
contamination which is the

1656
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:34,599
responsibility of The Growers results in

1657
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,199
destruction of product when that's

1658
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:40,440
intercepted and overproduction is a

1659
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:43,960
gigantic problem and that's not you know

1660
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,639
the the the uh you know the government's

1661
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,000
fault I mean there probably certain ways

1662
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:49,679
to blame the public sector on that but

1663
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,119
but when you overproduce and it doesn't

1664
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,919
get to Market I mean canab Canada is

1665
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:56,960
destroying you know thousands of tons of

1666
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,680
cannabis every every year that's just

1667
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,679
cuz they're over producing and you can't

1668
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:04,679
keep it you know more than a year or so

1669
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:06,038
it loses THC and the CBD profile changes

1670
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:07,440
and I mean that's a whole separate

1671
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:09,079
conversation of why is this over

1672
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,358
production happening and I'm no expert

1673
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:13,039
in it but I'm observing it and I have

1674
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:14,719
not folded that into the study because

1675
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,039
we don't know how much of that's

1676
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:17,679
happening but if you look there's a lot

1677
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:19,680
of it discussed in the appendix of the

1678
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:22,480
paper a lot of specific numbers and

1679
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:26,199
examples and Industry reports and it's

1680
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,480
giant amounts and so you know you you

1681
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:30,879
have to look at you there's a lot of

1682
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,760
reasons that more is grown than is uh

1683
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,960
consumed and then product recalls you

1684
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,240
know is something that happens and I

1685
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,440
don't think it's happening much which is

1686
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:41,838
arguably a problem but uh but it's not

1687
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,639
uh that's not again a giant to digit

1688
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,599
effect but it's just one of you know

1689
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:47,400
it's an example of how to think about

1690
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,720
the gross production versus the Net

1691
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:53,119
consumption and and who where that

1692
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:55,879
energy and and uh emissions burden gets

1693
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:57,880
allocated and then it brings us to an

1694
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,400
point about legalization which is you

1695
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,920
know a question that is everyone wants

1696
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:07,200
to ask as well does legalization at the

1697
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:09,480
national scale solve uh climate problem

1698
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:13,038
and we can talk about that now now or

1699
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:15,760
later but the uh one thing it does avoid

1700
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:18,039
is the interdiction product Destruction

1701
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,640
part of this puzzle which again is a

1702
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:22,920
minor effect on the overall footprint

1703
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:25,318
but it's not a trivial one we'll come

1704
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,720
back to that uh during the third set I

1705
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:32,119
want want to finish off this second set

1706
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:35,239
with um a uh a a short discussion on um

1707
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:39,079
fertilizers um specifically um on

1708
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:41,639
shaping fire we are always teaching um

1709
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:44,440
wildcrafting uh regenerative agriculture

1710
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:48,358
making your own compost um you know

1711
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:50,960
using uh local inputs um you know things

1712
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:52,639
like that and and you know of course

1713
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:56,079
we're we're we're encouraging people

1714
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:59,199
we're trying to coax them away uh from

1715
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:02,079
uh synthetics and a+b fertilizers and

1716
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:04,598
petroleum derivatives and and you know

1717
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:08,960
th this kind of uh

1718
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:12,240
synthetic of of cannabis fertilizers and

1719
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:15,358
um and and and certainly there is some

1720
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,599
uh energy usage with a regenerative as

1721
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:18,119
well you know it's still getting

1722
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,279
packaged some way it's still being

1723
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:22,640
shipped in most cases not everybody's

1724
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:26,199
wildcrafting so so some of that is same

1725
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:29,520
between the both but but but uh you know

1726
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:30,318
I I have an assumption that most of this

1727
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,120
uh

1728
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:36,480
regenerative um soil amendments because

1729
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:38,759
they are often in the form that they

1730
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,759
were in nature you know maybe we need to

1731
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:45,520
crush the crabshell but but it but it is

1732
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,560
not like um you know building an a+b

1733
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,520
fertilizer profile that's just going to

1734
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,839
like supercharge the plant and so I I'm

1735
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,719
wondering how do how do those compare

1736
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:59,119
the the the the growing inputs

1737
01:08:55,719 --> 01:09:01,719
specifically that are related to

1738
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,479
nutrition yeah important point and I

1739
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:07,600
would refer your um your listeners to

1740
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:09,959
the the widely uh talked about article

1741
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,000
by Haley Summers and her colleagues from

1742
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,679
Colorado a couple years ago and and that

1743
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,359
was the first real serious so-called

1744
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,920
life cycle assessment of cannabis where

1745
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,960
they went through you know am modium

1746
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,000
nitrate and triple super phosphate and

1747
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:24,239
pottassium chloride and other soil

1748
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,158
amendments and also you know uh uh neem

1749
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:29,158
oil and fungicide and other things so

1750
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:31,439
they did all that math and uh I bake

1751
01:09:29,158 --> 01:09:33,599
that into the work I'm doing and so for

1752
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,879
the way that comes out oh and by the way

1753
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,920
let's talk about carbon dioxide which is

1754
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:41,719
actually the largest single part of the

1755
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:44,359
non cultivation energy carbon footprint

1756
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:46,880
so that's another input and you have

1757
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:48,079
that carbon dioxide is made industrially

1758
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,798
and I don't want to hear about like

1759
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,278
citing grows next to breweries yeah okay

1760
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:53,719
you know do that here and there it's

1761
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:56,640
fine do it if you can but we're just

1762
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:58,560
we're not going to have anheiser Bush uh

1763
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:03,600
you know putting cannabis grows next to

1764
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:06,640
all its U uh crappy beer factories um so

1765
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,159
so the I got my spreadsheet uh spun up

1766
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,239
while you were asking me this question

1767
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:13,879
so the in this study the carbon

1768
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:15,439
footprint from all these inputs that I

1769
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:19,600
just rattled off also there's the

1770
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:23,759
mineral wool right which is what melted

1771
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:25,640
freaking Rock so so there's a lot of

1772
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,159
carbon and because there's a lot of

1773
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,239
energy in spinning mineral woil into

1774
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,960
these cubes that are used once and are

1775
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:35,039
generally not recyclable and go straight

1776
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,239
to landfill um that's actually the

1777
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:38,719
second

1778
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:40,399
largest well no sorry there's there's

1779
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,800
other ones that other soil amendments

1780
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:46,599
are more important but at any rate the

1781
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:49,400
um so if you look at the inputs as a as

1782
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:52,440
a percentage as a ratio to the energy

1783
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:55,799
carbon for cultivation the inputs add

1784
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:57,759
are about a third more so it sign ific

1785
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:01,039
if you look at the whole bwax all the

1786
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,400
transportation everything about 20% of

1787
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:05,560
all the national

1788
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:07,359
emissions from Cannabis are from the the

1789
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,239
inputs that's actually also averaging

1790
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:12,238
together indoor and outdoor and all of

1791
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:14,639
it so certain sub slices might be uh

1792
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:17,879
might be more or less so it does matter

1793
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,960
but bottom line it certainly matters and

1794
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,960
the um you know and again you're also

1795
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,520
sending stuff to landfill instead of

1796
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,079
composting so there's other reasons that

1797
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,960
you know better than I do of why closing

1798
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:29,319
these Loops can can really help you just

1799
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,039
want to be sure not to make methane in

1800
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:32,599
your compost pile because then you're

1801
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:34,399
really shooting yourself in the foot if

1802
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:38,079
it goes anerobic because it methane's an

1803
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:40,158
extremely potent um greenhouse gas uh

1804
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:43,679
but like I said the biggest problem is

1805
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:46,479
CO2 and you know it's it's the biggest

1806
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,639
single additional carbon footprint uh

1807
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:53,079
you know element beyond the the

1808
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:55,560
energy itself the creation of these uh

1809
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:59,559
petroleum based fertilizers I must ad I

1810
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,679
don't exactly know how they are um made

1811
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,159
because they've just never been

1812
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:07,880
attracted to me attractive to me um um

1813
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:11,158
how does that fertilizer creation

1814
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:14,199
process compare with you know the

1815
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:16,719
regenerative way of just collecting

1816
01:12:14,198 --> 01:12:18,960
natural items to mix into our

1817
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:22,039
soil yeah that's above my pay grade I

1818
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,520
don't it's not my specialty but it's

1819
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:24,840
there's a lot of literature out there on

1820
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,520
it and you know and there's a lot of

1821
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,639
fossil Fuel and you know the the making

1822
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,639
of nitrate you know in particular is a

1823
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:34,159
is known to be you know very energy

1824
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:36,560
intensive uh process I bet you that

1825
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:39,759
there is a rich area for study down that

1826
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,880
rabbit hole too yeah so okay so let's go

1827
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,600
ahead and take our second commercial

1828
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,800
break when we come back in set three um

1829
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:49,520
I want to talk more about some of the

1830
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,760
perspectives um that are needed and and

1831
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,639
some of them that you mentioned during

1832
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,280
the first set which I found to be very

1833
01:12:52,639 --> 01:12:57,679
valuable so so uh you are listening

1834
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:59,800
shaping fire and my guest today is uh

1835
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,760
energy and environmental systems analyst

1836
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,520
Evan Mills and you know without these

1837
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,679
advertisers shaping fire would not

1838
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:09,360
happen so please support them and let

1839
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,359
them know you heard them on shaping

1840
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:14,238
fire one of the challenges with buying

1841
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,319
Autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1842
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:18,879
have as many different fenos as you will

1843
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:21,799
have seeds in a pack that can be fun

1844
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:24,000
sure but so many varieties in one pack

1845
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:26,079
is a sign of an immature seedline that

1846
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,119
hasn't been worked enough

1847
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:30,158
I prefer my autoflowers to be worked

1848
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:31,760
enough that each feno in the pack really

1849
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:32,559
captures the aspects that the breeder

1850
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,480
was

1851
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,199
intending this is why I recommend gnome

which further enhance nutrient

1901
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,920
availability for the plants because

1902
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,199
plants are limited by the absence of any

everywhere and always gorgeous flower

1950
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,238
photos on both profiles the emphasis is

1951
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,880
on sharing what I've learned in a way

1952
01:17:35,238 --> 01:17:39,599
that you can replicate it in your own

1953
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:42,159
garden your own hash lab or for your own

1954
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:45,760
canopic health so I encourage you to

1955
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:48,679

01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,520
to shaping fire I am your host Shango

1959
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,239
and my guest today is energy and

1960
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:02,199
environmental systems analyst Evan Mills

1961
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:06,158
so Evan you know I have had to hold

1962
01:18:02,198 --> 01:18:08,759
myself um as host several times during

1963
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:11,960
the show because I have gone my whole

1964
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:14,199
life defending cannabis from from people

1965
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,399
who wanted to tell me it was a a drug

1966
01:18:14,198 --> 01:18:18,319
with no medical use and and people who

1967
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:20,519
said I shouldn't be around it because of

1968
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:22,359
the law and then people who are telling

1969
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:24,280
me that we shouldn't grow it because I

1970
01:18:22,359 --> 01:18:26,119
don't have a license and then you know

1971
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:28,880
it's it's it's it's one thing after

1972
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:30,800
another where I have been trying and and

1973
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:34,199
all of those with me right all of all of

1974
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:36,560
my cannabis family we're we've all so

1975
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:38,960
used to defending cannabis and defending

1976
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,080
ourselves and defending our rights and

1977
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,359
and trying to get people to understand

1978
01:18:41,079 --> 01:18:48,000
that this herb is healing of the mind

1979
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:50,439
soul and body and and so you know

1980
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,800
talking about cannabis in the way that

1981
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:56,919
we have today I I'm also Pro the

1982
01:18:53,800 --> 01:19:01,079
environment but also Am Naturally kind

1983
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:05,319
of knee jerky wanting to to just defend

1984
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:09,039
cannabis and and and I think that part

1985
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:12,000
of the big shift that has to happen is

1986
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:15,399
is messaging to come through for people

1987
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,279
to understand that we can still love

1988
01:19:15,399 --> 01:19:22,759
cannabis swear by it defend it and also

1989
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:27,158
be responsible for the energy usage that

1990
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:29,639
our you know favorite plant is using and

1991
01:19:27,158 --> 01:19:31,238
and you know unfortunately the poor way

1992
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:33,159
that it's being implemented

1993
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:35,839
bureaucratically but I think at the core

1994
01:19:33,158 --> 01:19:39,519
of it somehow those of us who love it

1995
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:41,039
need to split from identifying the

1996
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,679
Cannabis as

1997
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:46,960
ourselves and instead understand that it

1998
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:49,840
it's time for us to work um with the

1999
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,319
plant in a way so that we're not abusing

2000
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,400
the environment to get the part of it

2001
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:54,719
that we

2002
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:57,039
like you just answered your own question

2003
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,800
beautifully what's the next question

2004
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:03,158
no give it your own context

2005
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:06,119
pleas you set that up really well and

2006
01:20:03,158 --> 01:20:08,238
rationally and look you know I grew up

2007
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:10,800
uh I was born in 1960 I grew up in the

2008
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:12,879
fabled Laurel Canyon I used to go as to

2009
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,159
chich and Chong's kids uh Halloween

2010
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:18,079
parties I live in Northern California

2011
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:20,920
now in the Redwoods I'm a organic

2012
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:24,000
Gardener not of cannabis but of you know

2013
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:26,760
I love my garden uh I not against the

2014
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,279
plant or against uh you know people who

2015
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:32,480
who want to use it uh it's you know J uh

2016
01:20:30,279 --> 01:20:34,599
the um Henry Ford one of his you know

2017
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,479
many famous quotes was everything can

2018
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:39,159
always be done better than it

2019
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:43,238
is be done better than it's done now and

2020
01:20:39,158 --> 01:20:45,679
that's part of what leads to Innovation

2021
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:47,359
and there's you know the sky and you

2022
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,158
know you earlier you were asking how LED

2023
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:51,119
lights can be done better and that that

2024
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:52,759
is a valid thing and it is something

2025
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:55,399
that's being chased so I think just

2026
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,280
having the attitude of uh

2027
01:20:55,399 --> 01:21:00,960
let's be creative let's be smarter let's

2028
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:03,399
be sure we're current um let's be not

2029
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:06,198
let our protectiveness you know I I was

2030
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:07,839
listening to another podcast and the guy

2031
01:21:06,198 --> 01:21:09,319
uh was in the industry and he was

2032
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,400
opposing Interstate

2033
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:13,359
transport uh because he wanted to

2034
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:15,039
protect his local market and you know

2035
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:17,479
it's a free country at least for the

2036
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:19,920
moment just we have to be care you know

2037
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:23,319
think big you know think about the big

2038
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:25,719
picture uh do we really want to oppose

2039
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:28,439
interstate commerce to

2040
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:31,039
protect with you know without any kind

2041
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:32,839
of counterweight to it cuz that's that's

2042
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:35,279
potentially going to have an energy you

2043
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:37,039
know climate con consequence is it worth

2044
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:39,599
it

2045
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:41,760
um so I don't know if that's helpful but

2046
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:46,039
you know those are some I think some

2047
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:49,119
thoughts uh I the industry is also to be

2048
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:52,039
honest uh starting to do some of this on

2049
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:54,279
its own uh you look at like there been

2050
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:57,238
some years now you know canopy growth in

2051
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:59,599
can closed gigantic indoor warehouses

2052
01:21:57,238 --> 01:22:00,638
and transitioned you know to greenhouse

2053
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,960
and you know there's more and more

2054
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:05,359
Greenhouse coming that's been one of the

2055
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,039
big changes since the 2012 study

2056
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:08,839
obviously at that point there was you

2057
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:11,880
know very little of these you know

2058
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,520
prodigious you know 300,000 square foot

2059
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,400
you know green houses happening now

2060
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,960
they're no Panacea and it's too bad that

2061
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:18,559
they have the word Green in their name

2062
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,319
because they use a lot of the

2063
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,480
humidification most of them use a lot of

2064
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:25,679
electric lighting um and still the

2065
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:27,279
artificial the uh fossil based inputs

2066
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:29,880
and and all of that but there is less

2067
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:32,559
energy and there's and that there's a

2068
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,079
lot of optimization potential there for

2069
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,960
sure in the greenhouse type you know

2070
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:38,238
daylight I mean we're using daylight in

2071
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,600
our buildings you know there's a whole

2072
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:43,718
science around daylighting for humans

2073
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:46,719
and use making more use of that and the

2074
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:48,639
potential uh for that pales compared to

2075
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,439
you know the Cannabis potential so

2076
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,079
getting smarter with green houses I

2077
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:53,678
think is a big one they they lose so

2078
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,000
much energy and they're almost always

2079
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:58,560
heated with natural gas you know that's

2080
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,399
that's more the convention and uh why do

2081
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,920
you have all this glass facing north and

2082
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:03,599
on and on you know so there are people

2083
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,399
out there who are you know have been

2084
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,440
working not just in the Cannabis space

2085
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:09,759
but in indoor egg more generally to try

2086
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:11,960
to optimize uh green houses but you know

2087
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,480
the cost of I I guess one thing I would

2088
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:17,840
add is that there's an enlightened

2089
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:21,079
self-preservation argument here too

2090
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,920
because you know I mean it C here in

2091
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:25,319
Northern California the out the Growers

2092
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,520
used to call our local electric utility

2093
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:31,158
PG their 20% partner because they were

2094
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:34,440
paying 20% of their revenues to PG for

2095
01:23:31,158 --> 01:23:36,399
their monthly energy bills and uh it's

2096
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:38,238
become a huge issue with profitability

2097
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,238
and I would argue it's some paper I

2098
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:41,839
haven't written yet but I think the

2099
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:46,198
bankruptcies that we're seeing in the

2100
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:47,639
Cannabis space are often tracing back uh

2101
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:49,599
not necessarily solely but in

2102
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:52,000
significant part to the energy spend you

2103
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,360
know you spend a lot of money up front

2104
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,238
for all the capital I mean these

2105
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:57,599
Lighting systems these HVAC systems and

2106
01:23:56,238 --> 01:23:59,559
then if you want to try to be green and

2107
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,520
putting in solar on top of that and

2108
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:04,920
water recovery from your waste Air

2109
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,679
Stream uh so it's become and then you

2110
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:10,158
operate and you're spending millions of

2111
01:24:06,679 --> 01:24:12,119
dollars a month can be on energy so it's

2112
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:13,559
a real pain point so you know in part

2113
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:15,039
industry is discovering this kind of the

2114
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,199
hard way but I would I would hate to see

2115
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:19,079
a big boom and bust where we have all

2116
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:20,319
these you know abandoned warehouses with

2117
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:22,960
all this equipment that nobody else

2118
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:25,960
needs in them and uh so the boom and

2119
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,039
bust I think is on on the menu for uh

2120
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:29,239
California because it's already

2121
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:31,960
happening right I I hope that we see

2122
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:35,718
this better in other states and um

2123
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:38,800
earlier in in in this last um run of

2124
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:40,760
words uh you had mentioned that um you

2125
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,520
know some of the things that um the

2126
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:45,719
industry is doing to improve and it's

2127
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:47,679
really startling how low the bar is for

2128
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:50,158
a lot of the folks to make an impression

2129
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:53,079
for example um you know I was down in

2130
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:55,759
California as I often am and you know I

2131
01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:58,639
picked up some regenerative uh cannabis

2132
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:01,079
flower from Soul Spirit garden and I was

2133
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:03,880
just I was overjoyed and and made an

2134
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:07,600
Instagram a post because they use um

2135
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:11,039
compostable Dube tubes and and um uh

2136
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,880
some kind of uh compostable paper ink um

2137
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:14,800
you know for their for their boxes and I

2138
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,679
was just floored to see something that

2139
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,279
existing because you know I I go into

2140
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:20,880
places all across the country and i'

2141
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:23,319
I've not seen anybody do that that

2142
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:25,319
actively and and here I am overjoyed and

2143
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:27,639
and you know all all love and support to

2144
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:29,439
Soul Spirit but but we we need to see

2145
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:32,880
that from just one farm right we need to

2146
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:36,000
see that with in entire States um moving

2147
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:39,719
in this generation or in this uh general

2148
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,079
direction um I was also curious earlier

2149
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:45,279
uh during Second set you you talked

2150
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:47,198
about some inherent Market bias towards

2151
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:50,198
indoor that wasn't coming from the

2152
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:52,359
consumer and uh and I wanted to hit on

2153
01:25:50,198 --> 01:25:54,000
that before we wrapped up so would you

2154
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:56,000
would you kind of color that in for us

2155
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,679
cuz I like to hear those points sure

2156
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,238
it's yeah it's pretty uh interesting and

2157
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:02,679
disheartening to dig in a bit to like

2158
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:05,599
how the Market's working in the

2159
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:07,880
regulatory sphere and and other aspects

2160
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,239
uh one is that that we see here in

2161
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,880
California and it's probably true in

2162
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:14,799
other states I know it's true in other

2163
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:18,600
states uh varying by state is that some

2164
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,880
of the legislation defers to well first

2165
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,560
of all some of the legislation like for

2166
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,800
a while Illinois was only allowing

2167
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:28,880
indoor cultivation

2168
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:32,119
full stop in California the legalization

2169
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,679
the recreational stage uh left it to it

2170
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:35,439
was it was legalized Statewide but it

2171
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:37,520
left it to the jurisdictions meaning

2172
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:41,118
counties and cities

2173
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:43,000
to to color in you know what the

2174
01:26:41,118 --> 01:26:46,079
policies were going to be and half of

2175
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,840
California by land area forbids outdoor

2176
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,359
cultivation so they can't make it

2177
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,719
illegal because the state allows it to

2178
01:26:50,359 --> 01:26:55,118
be legal but they can force it to only

2179
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,840
be indoors and one can have a

2180
01:26:55,118 --> 01:26:58,880
conversation about why in the world that

2181
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:01,039
is at the municipality level yeah it

2182
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:04,520
could be city or county so that's that's

2183
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:08,760
a a distortion and then you have um this

2184
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:10,840
whole world of financial incentives and

2185
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:13,039
I'm the first person to defend and argue

2186
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:15,520
for financial incentives for Energy

2187
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:17,039
Efficiency and and Renewables uh we

2188
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,239
typically think of them as utility

2189
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:20,800
rebates for better LED lighting in this

2190
01:27:19,238 --> 01:27:24,439
industry but there can be yeah rebates

2191
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:25,760
for rebates for sungrown and exactly so

2192
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:28,238
you put your finger on it that's what's

2193
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,360
not happening and so instead you see I

2194
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:31,439
mean you Google around you'll see

2195
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:34,519
Growers being handed these large you

2196
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:39,319
know uh table-sized cardboard checks for

2197
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:42,760
a million dollars for putting in LED

2198
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:46,399
lights okay maybe but what you're doing

2199
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:49,000
is you're subsidizing them to a large

2200
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:51,319
degree I mean these are giant rebates

2201
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,039
and you're making their product even

2202
01:27:51,319 --> 01:27:57,439
more competitive to to uh outdoor gr to

2203
01:27:55,039 --> 01:28:00,880
Sun Fe feeding the wrong solution yeah

2204
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:03,519
and so imagine if indoor sorry if if

2205
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:06,159
outdoor producers were sorry if current

2206
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,920
indoor producers were given an incentive

2207
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:13,839
like that to not get uh 10% Energy

2208
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:15,359
savings but to get 99% Energy savings by

2209
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,639
shifting to outdoor cultivation and

2210
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:18,679
maybe that million dollar check should

2211
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,560
go to them and at least level that

2212
01:28:18,679 --> 01:28:24,560
playing field you know have no subsidies

2213
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:27,159
if you don't like subsidies or you know

2214
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,880
make it make it fair and reward all the

2215
01:28:27,158 --> 01:28:32,158
good behavior and not just one so

2216
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:34,639
there's that and then I think lastly you

2217
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:36,638
know there's this issue of cities and

2218
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:39,239
the trend towards Urban

2219
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:40,520
cultivation and you know you don't I

2220
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:41,879
mean you may notice because you're in

2221
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,320
the industry but the average person

2222
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:45,560
driving around in a neighborhood with

2223
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:47,920
warehouses doesn't realize that there's

2224
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:50,560
you know a Walmart sized Warehouse that

2225
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:54,399
they're driving by that's all cannabis

2226
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:56,280
and they're there you know for some the

2227
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:59,319
wrong reasons they're being given you

2228
01:28:56,279 --> 01:29:01,800
know sweetheart deals on their taxes or

2229
01:28:59,319 --> 01:29:02,920
you know lower fees whatever and the

2230
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,920
cities want them there because the

2231
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:07,600
cities are getting uh local taxes and

2232
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,760
local permit free so it's a conflict of

2233
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,600
interest and I don't pretend to know how

2234
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:14,079
often you know that swaying things but

2235
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,400
the cities have a conflict of interest

2236
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:17,760
be in wanting the Cannabis facilities

2237
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:19,279
there which kind of by definition have

2238
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,320
to be indoors if they're in the urban

2239
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:24,439
Fabric in this world you know in this

2240
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:27,279
country and uh and then but they're

2241
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:29,319
blowing up their carbon footprint uh at

2242
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:30,719
the same time by by drawing these

2243
01:29:29,319 --> 01:29:32,319
entities cuz there are like there are

2244
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,319
outdoor Growers from California who've

2245
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:35,319
moved to Oakland you know and then

2246
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:37,840
sometimes these

2247
01:29:35,319 --> 01:29:40,559
Growers uh you know get on a Jag and

2248
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,279
they blow out the PE the utility um

2249
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,800
Transformers and they bring in diesel

2250
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:46,800
generators to run you know their grows

2251
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,679
in these low-income environmentally

2252
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,840
overburdened areas and I'm getting off

2253
01:29:48,679 --> 01:29:53,719
track from your question but it it's a

2254
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:57,319
the urban urbanization of cultivation

2255
01:29:53,719 --> 01:29:59,399
but Denver's got 200 Factory scale grows

2256
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:01,799
in the you know in the core of Denver

2257
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:02,679
Oakland has about 200 in their so-called

2258
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:07,159
green

2259
01:30:02,679 --> 01:30:09,000
zone so I think that's an issue and uh I

2260
01:30:07,158 --> 01:30:11,238
think we can do better you know in that

2261
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,079
that The Regulators have a role to play

2262
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:16,118
in uh leveling the playing field and and

2263
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:19,000
not throwing obstacles in front of in

2264
01:30:16,118 --> 01:30:21,279
front of Industry doing the right thing

2265
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,279
you mentioned that um you mentioned

2266
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:27,118
interstate commerce earlier and uh you

2267
01:30:24,279 --> 01:30:30,399
know we've all been joking since the

2268
01:30:27,118 --> 01:30:32,679
since the med early medical days that um

2269
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:35,319
it's kind of California versus everybody

2270
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:38,399
right like as like like if if you want

2271
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:40,759
to have a cannabis company in your state

2272
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:43,359
you need to get up you need to get

2273
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:45,840
efficient and you need to lock in your

2274
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:48,839
customer base before

2275
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,279
Interstate uh sales is allowed because

2276
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:54,079
as because California's going to eat

2277
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:56,039
everybody's lunch and um you know and

2278
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:58,399
there's there's a lot to be said for

2279
01:30:56,039 --> 01:31:01,118
that and and then there there's a lot of

2280
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,399
challenges to be said for that too but

2281
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:06,279
but you've looked at the numbers and and

2282
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:08,279
and what do you see in your crystal ball

2283
01:31:06,279 --> 01:31:11,479
as far as the impact of interstate

2284
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:14,079
commerce on the you know overall energy

2285
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:16,000
consumption uh for the Cannabis

2286
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:17,559
industry I haven't been able to put

2287
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
numbers on that at this point there's

2288
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,800
just not enough data but there's a long

2289
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,719
discussion in the paper about how to

2290
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:26,760
think about it and all the kind of

2291
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:28,880
unexpected counterveiling factors there

2292
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,920
and you know how much we would save or

2293
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,118
how much we wouldn't save uh you know

2294
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:34,199
there's a lot of as you mentioned

2295
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:37,639
California is the big gorilla and you

2296
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:39,118
think of all the uh all the Cannabis

2297
01:31:37,639 --> 01:31:40,560
already I mean I think California

2298
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:42,198
produces like three times as much

2299
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,880
cannabis as Californians consume

2300
01:31:42,198 --> 01:31:45,359
something like that so all that's going

2301
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,880
to other states California is one of the

2302
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:50,039
cleaner States because we have a clean

2303
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:52,400
grid and so if you do the thought

2304
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:53,639
experiment and say well now we have

2305
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:56,359
interstate commerce and we're going to

2306
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:59,840
say all this carbon by having more local

2307
01:31:56,359 --> 01:32:01,158
production you have to subtract that you

2308
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,840
may just be bringing in the same

2309
01:32:01,158 --> 01:32:04,879
cannabis that's just now on the legal

2310
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:08,440
side so it's pretty tricky this is

2311
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:10,440
pretty tricky but I do that said I think

2312
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:13,799
you know the the there's so much of the

2313
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:16,479
US that's suitable for uh lowc carbon

2314
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:18,560
outdoor cultivation and you know

2315
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:21,079
interstate commerce is an obstacle to

2316
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:23,239
that and being able to flow uh

2317
01:32:21,079 --> 01:32:25,079
everywhere and I just you know I can't

2318
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:28,759
put numbers on for you but it's a big

2319
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:30,319
one we did look at legalization more

2320
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:33,239
broadly kind of adjacent to the question

2321
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:36,079
you're asking uh how much carbon might

2322
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:37,919
that save in its own right and it's

2323
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:39,880
rather small you know it's difficult to

2324
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,560
model difficult to think through but

2325
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:45,679
basically the big benefit of

2326
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:47,159
legalization is less landfill and or I'm

2327
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:49,199
sorry there's more landfill that's an

2328
01:32:47,158 --> 01:32:51,960
offsetting effect right because mandated

2329
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:54,198
landfill happens in the legal Market not

2330
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,600
in the other one so there's uh there's

2331
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:57,519
some ways in which it can increase

2332
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,560
emissions all the packaging is one that

2333
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,199
you mentioned before you know there's uh

2334
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,560
one new paper says there's more

2335
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:06,039
packaging in regulated markets than in

2336
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:10,600
the illicit market and in Pre uh

2337
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:14,760
pre-regulated markets um but also on the

2338
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:16,199
upside uh you have um from legalization

2339
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:19,320
you have you you're taking the

2340
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:21,599
interdiction out of it and so all that

2341
01:33:19,319 --> 01:33:24,359
cannabis that's destroyed and all that

2342
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:26,520
embodied energy in carbon is principle

2343
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:28,118
you know in in a rarified case uh not

2344
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:30,360
happening anymore so that's so it's

2345
01:33:28,118 --> 01:33:31,960
something like an 8% reduction in

2346
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:34,599
National carbon footprint from

2347
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:37,239
legalization in its own right but that

2348
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,600
said legalization is kind of a necessary

2349
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:42,439
but not sufficient uh mile poost on the

2350
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,320
route to all kinds of other policies

2351
01:33:42,439 --> 01:33:48,638
right you can't incentivize better

2352
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:50,880
practices in an illicit market and today

2353
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:52,359
right now about the carbon about little

2354
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,039
more than half of the national carbon

2355
01:33:52,359 --> 01:33:55,920
footprint is in the elicit Market and a

2356
01:33:54,039 --> 01:33:57,399
little less than half is in the legal

2357
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,480
Market by the way so there's a lot

2358
01:33:57,399 --> 01:34:00,599
there's a lot to address still yeah that

2359
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:02,319
is a lot to address on the other side

2360
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,000
but it's interesting how that comes out

2361
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:05,279
uh it's not necessarily obvious that it

2362
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,679
would break down like that much more of

2363
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:09,158
the production is in the illicit Market

2364
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:11,440
but also the elicit Market has a much

2365
01:34:09,158 --> 01:34:14,079
larger share of outdoor than the legal

2366
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:16,599
Market does so that's part of why um

2367
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:18,399
even though you know 75 80% of the

2368
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:21,079
production is in the elicit side

2369
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:23,158
nationally the uh the carbon Footprints

2370
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:26,198
are more more 50/50 is because there's

2371
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:30,039
more outdoor on the elicit side

2372
01:34:26,198 --> 01:34:33,079
um so to to wrap us up here um we have

2373
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:36,399
given folks a whole lot of data points

2374
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:38,118
and perspectives and so many of them um

2375
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:39,679
you know they they're lubricated and

2376
01:34:38,118 --> 01:34:41,639
they've got pivot Points and they depend

2377
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:44,520
on these so so it can be it's very much

2378
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:46,199
a you know a complex web and and as you

2379
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,840
address this then the other part moves

2380
01:34:46,198 --> 01:34:52,559
and so let's let's let's distill this

2381
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:55,119
down to um some I don't know marching

2382
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,440
orders or or suggestion is probably a

2383
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:59,479
little less

2384
01:34:56,439 --> 01:35:01,759
authoritarian um so for for the two key

2385
01:34:59,479 --> 01:35:03,319
groups who who we're talking to now

2386
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,280
right because obviously we'd have a lot

2387
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:07,079
to say for the politicians but they're

2388
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:10,039
probably not still listening to the

2389
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:13,960
episode the people who are listening are

2390
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:16,600
cannabis consumers and um and uh the

2391
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:19,198
Cannabis business owners the cultivators

2392
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,760
and so um let's take the business first

2393
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:23,519
and then we'll talk about then then

2394
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:24,520
we'll talk to the consumers so so you

2395
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,480
know

2396
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,920
if if if if a indoor cultivator and

2397
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:31,439
they've got their heart in the right

2398
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:34,319
place and they have just heard our

2399
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:36,559
conversation and they're like damn I

2400
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:40,319
think that at the very least I need to

2401
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:42,239
start doing stuff to decrease my energy

2402
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:43,920
consumption it'll be better for the

2403
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:46,158
company and it'll be better for the

2404
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,440
environment and I I want to help there

2405
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:49,759
be a planet for my kids okay so they're

2406
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:52,919
they heading their hearts in the right

2407
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:55,000
place but they already have an indoor um

2408
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:58,920
they already have an indoor cultivation

2409
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:02,520
and so what would you give to them as

2410
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:05,118
the first steps on a path that are

2411
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:07,800
attainable yeah good good questions and

2412
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:09,880
and I have to say uh you know I've had a

2413
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:12,840
lot of emails and things from producers

2414
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:14,600
over the years and uh more than a

2415
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:15,960
handful have said they've changed their

2416
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,800
business model you know they've looked

2417
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,639
at this and over time they've shifted

2418
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,639
their their industry towards you know

2419
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:25,279
greenhouse and then outdoor so you know

2420
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:26,760
strategic longer t term way there's no

2421
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:28,079
shame in that and it's something that's

2422
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:29,679
done all the time and you can look at

2423
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:33,840
the large Industries and they're

2424
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:36,600
definitely shifting their you know their

2425
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,400
center of gravity from from indoor

2426
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,520
towards outdoor so there's that the

2427
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:44,679
longer term I think uh nearer term you

2428
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:47,679
know look at geta energy audits you know

2429
01:36:44,679 --> 01:36:50,079
really look at your processes uh think

2430
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:52,960
about I don't want to say greedy but

2431
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:54,800
like maximizing yield you know is it

2432
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,760
everything numbers more carefully

2433
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,600
because maximum yield isn't necessarily

2434
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:00,880
maximum profitability you know like

2435
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:02,639
things are you know it's expensive to

2436
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,319
push you know a crop and I'm not

2437
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:06,440
pretending I know more than these

2438
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:08,079
cultivators who've spent their you know

2439
01:37:06,439 --> 01:37:10,158
their professional lives you know

2440
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:11,760
dialing this in but but be sure you've

2441
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:14,399
got good info good

2442
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:16,199
advice think twice at it think twice

2443
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:18,559
about you know your your current

2444
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:20,919
practices think about Henry Ford and how

2445
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:24,320
you can do better um so I think that's

2446
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:26,960
as a as a near-term about as good is we

2447
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:29,319
can get and

2448
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,319
um and then then how about the consumer

2449
01:37:29,319 --> 01:37:33,639
then because you know the consumer it's

2450
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:36,039
interesting because the consumer is both

2451
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:37,319
the most powerful and the least powerful

2452
01:37:36,039 --> 01:37:39,519
they're they're at the end of the long

2453
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:41,559
chain so it's really hard to influence

2454
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,880
any of it but because it's all being

2455
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:46,800
made for us it actually does empower us

2456
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,840
but I definitely don't think that uh

2457
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,800
consumers are using their power at all

2458
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:54,840
so so what would you say to us as

2459
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:58,279
consumers about some kind of action we

2460
01:37:54,840 --> 01:38:00,000
can take to to to to move the the the

2461
01:37:58,279 --> 01:38:03,158
the percentages in the right

2462
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,840
direction yeah I think the consumer is

2463
01:38:03,158 --> 01:38:08,799
doesn't realize their power in as in so

2464
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,800
many cases right energy climate more

2465
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,199
broadly and and all kinds of other

2466
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:17,119
issues so I think talk to your bud

2467
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:20,839
tender ask questions be curious uh ask

2468
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:23,279
for uh you know ask for data on your on

2469
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:26,119
the different products make it known

2470
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:28,000
that it it matters to you and you know

2471
01:38:26,118 --> 01:38:29,759
consumers can change their behavior and

2472
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,599
that changes the market and there are

2473
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:34,560
consumers uh it sounds like like

2474
01:38:31,599 --> 01:38:38,119
yourself you know who who uh prefers

2475
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:41,800
sungrown and uh hunt for the product

2476
01:38:38,118 --> 01:38:43,198
that's just right for them or I mean I

2477
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,639
don't think it's even necessary but come

2478
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:46,839
down and not and quality whatever it's

2479
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:49,079
just or make quality part of your

2480
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,840
definition of sorry make environment

2481
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:53,000
part of your definition of quality right

2482
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,800
it's that doesn't seem like a stretch

2483
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,118
like what is quality what is quality of

2484
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:59,039
life isn't part of quality of life being

2485
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:01,598
you know not having our our homes burned

2486
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:03,679
in Wildfire seriously you know so so I

2487
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:05,679
think the consumers you know being aware

2488
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:06,800
and educating themselves and it's hard

2489
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:08,239
right because there's very little

2490
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,199
information out there for them and and

2491
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:11,839
it's not being provided by industry I

2492
01:39:10,198 --> 01:39:13,359
think also being aware of greenwashing

2493
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,840
you know there's a lot of greenwashing

2494
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:17,158
unfortunately I have a page on my site

2495
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,920
that your listeners are welcome to look

2496
01:39:17,158 --> 01:39:21,039
at with examples of the greenwashing

2497
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:24,239
that happens and it shouldn't be on the

2498
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:25,920
consumer to root that out and uh clean

2499
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:27,598
that up but

2500
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,039
unfortunately there aren't really

2501
01:39:27,599 --> 01:39:33,560
Regulators you know going after this but

2502
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:35,359
that that's a a problem for consumers is

2503
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:37,639
uh even like the notion of Terre you

2504
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:40,479
know like so we've got cannabis grown in

2505
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:47,520
a windowless Factory not in soil with no

2506
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:49,759
sun no rain in California in in uh

2507
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:52,040
Arcada you know and it's called humbl

2508
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,039
you know like what is what is that so

2509
01:39:52,039 --> 01:39:54,599
maybe there's something there that I'm

2510
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,800
not understanding you know I guess the

2511
01:39:54,599 --> 01:39:58,400
water uh but the water's been so heavily

2512
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,599
treated by the time it gets there so I

2513
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:02,039
think that's something for consumers and

2514
01:40:00,599 --> 01:40:04,159
you know and back to the producers for a

2515
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:06,760
second I think another thing they can do

2516
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:09,519
is I mean it's under this Banner of

2517
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:12,480
being curious and inquisitive and also

2518
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,239
forthcoming you know share data work

2519
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:17,678
with

2520
01:40:13,238 --> 01:40:19,559
researchers um comp you know benchmark

2521
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:21,199
your carbon footprint against your

2522
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,639
competitors and see like well how am I

2523
01:40:21,198 --> 01:40:25,238
doing because benchmarking is a really

2524
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:27,000
powerful tool to see well what what are

2525
01:40:25,238 --> 01:40:28,759
other people what are the best practices

2526
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,039
out there and you know go for those

2527
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,560
there is a lot of documentation on best

2528
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:33,880
practices within indoor within

2529
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,440
Greenhouse so I think that's something

2530
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:38,039
to do and

2531
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:39,879
consider product labeling especially if

2532
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:41,319
you're doing better you know then get

2533
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:43,800
the word out there and work with the

2534
01:40:41,319 --> 01:40:46,679
dispensaries and work with these the

2535
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:48,639
value chain to get transparency for

2536
01:40:46,679 --> 01:40:51,158
consumers and if consumers are asking

2537
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:52,639
for it and producers are pushing it uh

2538
01:40:51,158 --> 01:40:54,920
then consumers will start to be more

2539
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:56,319
informed about you know about carbon

2540
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:59,279
footprint so that's something that

2541
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:00,960
everyone you know all the actors uh from

2542
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,079
The Regulators to The Growers to the

2543
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,960
consumers uh could do more and because

2544
01:41:03,079 --> 01:41:06,960
it's pitiful you know there's just

2545
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,800
there's such an information vacuum

2546
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,880
facing uh everybody you know all from

2547
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:15,360
Soup To Nuts there right on well thank

2548
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,639
you Evan you know um we easily could

2549
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:19,679
have done a couple more hours on this

2550
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:22,639
topic um but we you know the goal was

2551
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,760
not to inundate people too much but but

2552
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:28,279
to really

2553
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:31,320
illustrate to folks um you know how how

2554
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:34,679
tenacious energy consumption is all

2555
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:37,359
through um the chain and to start having

2556
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:40,279
us think about it whether our our end

2557
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:42,799
goal is to actually get outside or to

2558
01:41:40,279 --> 01:41:45,679
just decrease our electrical usage in

2559
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,800
our present operation as step one um I

2560
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:49,920
think that is you know it's an honorable

2561
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:52,279
Pursuit and uh and even though we don't

2562
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:55,079
want to look at anything that is you

2563
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:57,079
know chastising of cannabis well I I

2564
01:41:55,079 --> 01:41:59,039
think it's I think it's damn time so

2565
01:41:57,079 --> 01:42:01,198
thank you so much for giving of your

shaping fire and to to share your like

2568
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:10,158
wildly indepth understanding of the data

2569
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:11,880
behind our industry your your your

2570
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:14,519

questions excellent so dear listener if

2574
01:42:19,319 --> 01:42:25,519
you would like to follow up uh and learn

2575
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:27,800
even more for from Evan Mills um uh the

2576
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:30,639
best way to do that is to go to his

2577
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:32,719
website which is is kind of like a um

2578
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:35,440
it's kind of like a repository of of his

2579
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:38,679
research and the the graphics there are

2580
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:41,598
just absolutely educational and um

2581
01:42:38,679 --> 01:42:43,279
illustrative and fantastic so so even if

2582

2584
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:48,480
