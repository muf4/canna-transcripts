2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,138
in the early days cannabis primarily

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,449
tasted and smelled like it did due to

4
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,129
the soil climate and genetics of the

5
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,618
region of the world that it came from in

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,380
the United States we primarily received

7
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:20,820
flour from Mexico but flowers from other

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,309
Latin American countries certainly

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,990
showed up as well

10
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:27,659
rarely but sometimes we were able to

11
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:30,809
delight over something especially exotic

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,000
from Afghanistan or Thailand - over time

13
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,070
though enough bagsied found its way into

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,350
the hands of cannabis lovers who also

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,780
had the mind and resources to grow them

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,910
locally breeders all over the world

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,489
began to cross and hybridize these

18
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,949
cannabis keema vars to create unique

19
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,229
plants that had their own taste growing

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,660
patterns colours and medicinal value

21
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,878
this breeding happened both indoors and

22
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,679
outdoors but due to prohibition breeding

23
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,039
was mostly done indoors in the United

24
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,140
States breeders hybridized plans to

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,430
tease out the most wonderful attributes

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,829
sweet sour earthy skunky and fuel tastes

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,710
all became more pronounced once breeders

28
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:13,859
got involved breeders also selected for

29
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,569
mold resistance size overall health and

30
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,188
and so many other attributes that a

31
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,219
particular grower thought might be

32
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,500
valuable this dedication to craft is why

33
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:25,319
cannabis breeders are revered and why

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,140
modern cannabis is so badass compared to

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,298
the stuff we grew up on if you enjoy

36

00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,129
aficionados

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,420
like the black lime reserve strain today

59
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:20,669

60
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:23,159
breeding practices naming conventions

61
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:26,909
and that epic black line strain hey

62
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,409
welcome to the show Mean Gene okay how's

63
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,329
it going good good I'm glad that you

64
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,789
could make some time to be here you know

65
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,500
when I was getting set for this show the

66
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,349
first thing I noticed is that you know I

67
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,759
actually thought that your primary

68
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,829
association was with aficionado seeds

69
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,139
because everywhere I've gone it's always

70
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,930
like you know mean gene from aficionado

71
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,729
but after I got the opportunity to start

72
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,370
following your Instagram feed for a

73
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,649
while I realized that that you know the

74
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,990
the imprint that you are primarily

75
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,020
responsible for is actually your own

76
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,360
freeborn selections so would you kind of

77
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,090
like break it down for us like like how

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,550
you work between aficionado versus

79
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:12,590
freeborn uh yeah I mean um basically uh

80
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:16,080
you know Leo from aficionado was

81
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:19,860
somebody who actually was living right

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,780
on the same Road as me and he won the

83
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,350
Emerald cup and I see you know I said

84
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,569
well these guys look like they have some

85
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:30,150
good seeds and so you know I messaged

86
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,229
them I think on Facebook to to say hey

87
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,400
you know can I pick up some of your

88
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:37,769
seeds and I wound up meeting them and

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,270
you know they those guys saw what I had

90
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,640
and they were like do you want to do

91
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,650
some some kind of a release through

92
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,379
aficionado your stuff is really good and

93
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,840
so you know we started collaborating on

94
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,120
a little bit of stuff here and there and

95
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,789
we put out a black lime reserve and the

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,250
in the pines and the Versailles and I

97
00:03:53,789 --> 00:04:00,269
gave them the the red Hindu Kush f3 that

98
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:04,500
I had I think that's about the only ones

99
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:07,469
that we really put out and and that's

100
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,509
you know those are the ones that people

101
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,699
you know like black lime reserve was a

102
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,919
was a big huge hit I knew it was going

103
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:18,180
to be good because I really like black

104
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,529
lime myself and so when we put that one

105
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,389
out that one got a lot of really good

106
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,089
press and then I did I think it was

107
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:27,430
there was like 650 entries or something

108
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:31,899
in the Emerald Cup in 2000

109
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:34,150
was it 2014 I think and I took second

110
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:37,149
place with that and so people really

111
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:38,560
know me from from my work with efficient

112
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:40,120
auto more than anything else because

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,339
those are the those are really the only

114
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,870
feeds that I've publicly released other

115
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:51,879
than me and Braveheart from Oregon we

116
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:55,300
did a little giveaway that was a nubia

117
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:58,300
which is a CBD plant crossed with a with

118
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,960
the Harless ooh from ringo at Soham

119
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,579
seeds and so really freeborn selections

120
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,888
a lot of people are growing out the

121
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:08,769
seeds and have grown out the seeds that

122
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:11,168
I make for years but if for anybody to

123
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:14,139
really know me for having ever got any

124
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:15,819
of my seeds at a club or anywhere else

125
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,360
those would have been efficient Otto so

126
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:20,889
that's really why people you know if you

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,900
ask Oh me and gene they're going to go

128
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:24,819
yeah fishing Auto black lime Reserve in

129
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:27,969
the pines and those ones that I did work

130
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:29,889
on it's a lucky thing that you chose

131
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,780
somebody good to work with when you one

132
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,519
right because you know if you're going

133
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:35,679
to be associated with somebody you know

134
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,149
we owe an aficionado is like you know

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,250
that's that's that's something great to

136
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:42,429
be associated with even if it was you

137
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,408
know just for for a couple of runs yeah

138
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:51,728
for sure and you know it was funny

139
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:56,879
because they won in 2012 and then I came

140
00:05:51,728 --> 00:06:02,589
in in 2013 and I took third and then

141
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:05,620
2014 I took second and then mm uh 2015 I

142
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:07,658
guess I took first place in the Emerald

143
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,689
cup and it was funny because after a

144
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:12,668
while people started to say you know

145
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:15,129
it's fixed these guys win every time

146
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:18,459
there there's no way that you can just

147
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:19,959
win every time and you know it was

148
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:23,079
actually one of those things where I was

149
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:25,149
I was actually uh it was actually a

150
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:28,300
great feeling to have people say oh the

151
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:31,418
contest is fixed you win too much look

152
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,120
so about those mountain seven or eight

153
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:36,519
episodes ago we had your neighbor Alan

154
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,658
Adkison on the show and you know he was

155
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,519
telling us that you live on the same

156
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,589
mountain

157
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,478
and and he said he says yeah man he's

158
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:44,609
like you know you know I can throw a

159
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,709
rock and like you know uh you know hit

160
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,620
all of these cannabis cup winners that

161
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,658
live all around me now you know it's

162
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,610
like there's some kind of magic on that

163
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:55,800
mountain you know what do you look for

164
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,960
when you're looking for a location for

165
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,639
breeding well you know there's a really

166
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,779
interesting thing that happens and you

167
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,430
know there's the whole people have

168
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,348
finally started to kind of open their

169
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,949
eyes lately to the whole question of

170
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:10,319
Tour wah and and you know basically

171
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:12,780
location and some people will say oh it

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,000
doesn't matter because if you're growing

173
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,459
in potting soils and that doesn't even

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,829
it doesn't even plication doesn't even

175
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,258
play but what's interesting about this

176
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:23,788
part of California is that if you go all

177
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,460
the way over to them to the extreme

178
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:28,829
coastal zone your flowers will basically

179
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:30,689
produce mostly leaf and they'll produce

180
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:32,459
a lot of resin and they'll produce a lot

181
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:34,589
of terpenes but they'll have very little

182
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,138
density and they'll be very lightweight

183
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:40,288
and your plants will grow really slow

184
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,319
and it's not good for production but the

185
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:44,550
for smoke ability stuff is really nice

186
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,129
so then when you come a couple miles

187
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,210
back and then you start to get into

188
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:52,740
areas like calm qi Brandt's come a

189
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:57,329
little bit further inland and that would

190
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,759
be maybe like lake it uh you know the

191
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:02,218
west side of Garberville and Redway and

192
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,110
areas like that even a little further

193
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:05,939
west and close to the coast would be

194
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,000
like honeydew there's all these little

195
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,069
these little areas and every area has

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,839
something different and and from looking

197
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,610
at it over the years and being in

198
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,278
different places I've been able to find

199
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,098
a correlation where you look at what is

200
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:22,740
when you get farther away from the

201
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:27,329
coastal influence what happens is your

202
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,639
flowers they have smaller features every

203
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,508
part of the flower is smaller the stems

204
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,509
or Center

205
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:36,719
the leaves are smaller every everything

206
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:40,259
is basically smaller even the trichomes

207
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,260
even become shorter and more closely

208
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:45,299
clustered and so there's an interesting

209
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,600
thing that happens where when you go to

210
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:50,879
the coast it gets larvae when you go

211
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,379
inland it gets so hard that when you go

212
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,960
to break it up too

213
00:08:52,379 --> 00:09:00,000
like say roll a joint it actually breaks

214
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:02,430
down in almost a undesirable way where

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,250
those flowers themselves are so dense

216
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:07,769
that when it breaks up it almost turns

217
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,259
into powder and if you go over to the

218
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:13,710
coast then it breaks up into these big

219
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,950
chunks where every every piece is this

220
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:20,009
big big piece you know and so I'm right

221
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,020
at a place where I get the benefit of

222
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:26,700
the coastal influence that causes it to

223
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:31,740
grow really big well-defined features

224
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:35,040
and I get the really big tall thick

225
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,620
trichomes but I still have the advantage

226
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,439
of being far enough inland that my

227
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,220
flowers still are dense and they look

228
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,470
nice to people who are into that look of

229
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,379
something that's actually got a nice

230
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,509
dense round look to it yeah that bag

231
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,970
appeal yeah and so it's really

232
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:57,779
interesting because people will say okay

233
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,460
well you know it's just either it's a

234
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,379
coincidence or it's a fix

235
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,800
you know either as nothing to do with

236
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,600
anything scientific because it just is

237
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,490
random and there happens to be a lot of

238
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,909
people in this area who have

239
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,590
award-winning cannabis or they say oh

240
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:15,779
well they just give it to somebody who

241
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,580
they know from that area but what people

242
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,399
don't understand in a lot of cases is

243
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,200
that the way that people like Tim from

244
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,059
the Emerald cup or the judges from the

245
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,250
Emerald cup I met those guys because I

246
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,289
you know I mean I knew Tim from years

247
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,389
and years back but we weren't in the

248
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:33,899
same circle we didn't hang out together

249
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:37,649
he might have known who I was a little

250
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:39,539
bit but the reality was that those

251
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,730
people got to know me because they went

252
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,279
wow you had some really good really good

253
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,810
weed and that's how I started to know

254
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,759
those people it wasn't the other way

255
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:50,729
around and not that's how it happens

256
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,139
when you run an event like that and then

257
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,779
you meet people who have really

258
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,980
outstanding stuff you're going to go oh

259
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,659
well you're the one with the they

260
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,430
obviously have an interest in really

261
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:02,009
good weed they're having a contest right

262
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:03,889
right so that's how it happens that

263
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:06,240
their winds up being in this little area

264
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:09,269
in my opinion

265
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,310
uh people here have really been holding

266
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:14,278
a lot of the best genetics for a long

267
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:17,399
time this particular town in this county

268
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:21,350
is a place where a lot of really really

269
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:24,208
good stuff has has come out of and and

270
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,980
so you have the genetic advantage you

271
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:28,679
have the advantage of a lot of people

272
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,360
who have experience and then what I was

273
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,629
saying about the climate is you have

274
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,278
this one little area where you get the

275
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:38,338
best of both worlds where you have the

276
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:43,409
coastal influence but not enough to to

277
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:45,149
take away from the quality as far as you

278
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:47,429
know like okay well it's got the look

279
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,379
and it's got the smell and you know if

280
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:51,958
you go ahead and you go over one

281
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,750
Mountain over to the east you'll have a

282
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:57,838
lot heavier flowers and you'll get a lot

283
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,759
bigger yields but when you go to break

284
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,980
it down to roll up a joint when they go

285
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,189
to smoke it in a cup it doesn't break

286
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,379
down the way that like nice indoor break

287
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,870
down it's almost like it's compressed

288
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:14,070
because it grows so dense it's

289
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:16,049
ridiculous and so um you know for me if

290
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,260
I'm looking for the ideal climate I

291
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:24,000
really like places like you know just to

292
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:26,039
the east of Santa Cruz Santa Rosa the

293
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,889
east side of Garberville the east side

294
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,828
or red way right here where it's in

295
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:35,370
Mendocino along these ridges here

296
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:38,609
there's these certain areas that really

297
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,039
will produce um produce the type of

298
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,720
flower that makes it the most smokeable

299
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,059
and that wouldn't matter say for

300
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,430
something like concentrates but for the

301
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:49,588
actual in a flower contest there's a

302
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:52,319
certain texture that just breaks up and

303
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:55,829
it rolls up better and and so certain

304
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,839
strains if you have a left strain that

305
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:00,689
has less dense floral clusters and you

306
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,579
grow that to the east of me then it'll

307
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,010
get dense enough to where okay well

308
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:06,599
maybe someone Sour Diesel might be

309
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:08,899
coming from the east and that might do

310
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,879
better than something that I have here

311
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:14,070
because when I grow it here it's not

312
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,110
really dense enough to get the to win

313
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,760
the points on the look in the contest

314
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,079
you know yeah so there's there's

315
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,230
different things and there's certain

316
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:22,389
strains that do

317
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,610
in certain climates just like with great

318
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:27,759
so if you grow one type of grape you're

319
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,710
going to want one type of you want a

320
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,659
certain temperature on the nights and if

321
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,790
the year is not as good then it's not as

322
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:35,799
good of a it's not as good of a year for

323
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:39,189
a certain certain type of wine you know

324
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:41,199
and certain areas and and then of course

325
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,120
you know then the soil goes into play

326
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,490
but most people use potting soil and

327
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,049
that's the big that's the big point

328
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,669
everybody has well it doesn't matter

329
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:50,620
where you do it if you're using potting

330
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:52,089
soil and I'm like no climates big if you

331
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,129
run it indoor room and you keep it

332
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,850
slightly more humid then you're going to

333
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:59,289
have flowers that are going to be not so

334
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,840
ridiculously dense and if you run it a

335
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,579
very very arid environment you're going

336
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,990
to have stuff like if you grow purple

337
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,450
Urkel you look at it and you can't even

338
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,120
tell where the features are it's just

339
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,590
this thing you're like I can't tell

340
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,779
where anything is at all it looks like

341
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,370
somebody put it to smashed it all to get

342
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:18,220
grounded up and smashed it back together

343
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,399
because every little feature has grown

344
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,629
to be so petite you know yeah so um so

345
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,549
let me I'll take that one that's a big

346
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,710
thing yeah let's take that one more step

347
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:30,370
further right so so you're talking about

348
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,960
breeding the the superior flower for for

349
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,120
a cub and for you know you and your

350
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,780
friends to toke so how does that play

351
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:41,440
into the breeding right because you know

352
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:44,350
you're choosing you know your Yorkie

353
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,170
males and females in this you know kind

354
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,960
of Olympic training environment that

355
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:51,909
you're growing these flowers in and and

356
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,200
but then you know you're passing on this

357
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:55,149
gear to people who are going to be

358
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:00,430
growing it all over the country and

359
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:02,860
indoor and so you know do you what do

360
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:04,870
you keep what do you consider when

361
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,840
you're growing it on your property which

362
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,490
is pretty much a perfect place to grow

363
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,920
when you're considering the gear that

364
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,259
you're going to pass around to others so

365
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,289
that so that maybe it doesn't need to

366
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,929
have such a perfect environment oh well

367
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:22,120
that's that's another interesting thing

368
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:25,239
too is that as much as it's a great

369
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,870
environment for something that will do

370
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,879
well in a contest it's also an area

371
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:34,438
where things have to be really really

372
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:38,369
Hardy and they have to be really weather

373
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:40,469
and you know like if a strain is is

374
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:43,259
prone to powdery mildew it's going to

375
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:46,528
show in this area because we do start to

376
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,470
get the fog at the end of September so

377
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:51,568
where other places won't have it in and

378
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,100
we do get you know this is this is like

379
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:54,988
considered like a temperate rainforest

380
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,759
here especially when there used to be

381
00:15:54,989 --> 00:16:02,970
more redwoods in the area this area you

382
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,980
know this year I think I mean I this is

383
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,509
just a rough estimate but I think we got

384
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:12,449
maybe a hundred or 110 inches of rain

385
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:14,730
here this year and that started in the

386
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:17,159
end of September last year so anything

387
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,319
that does well here it's going to have a

388
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:21,539
pretty good shot at doing well for

389
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:23,278
people in most climates like if I have

390
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:25,649
something and it really does great for

391
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,308
me here somebody in Oregon or Washington

392
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:30,899
where the weather is even worse there

393
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:34,289
it's still going to do better than a lot

394
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,058
of stuff they might get because because

395
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:38,428
of how the weather is as opposed to if

396
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:41,519
say I was an outdoor guy and I was in I

397
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:46,350
was in Southern California or I was in

398
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:50,698
Nevada or you know if you were at a low

399
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:53,490
you know it just it's it's um we're at a

400
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:56,998
fairly high elevation here we're fairly

401
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,769
coastal and so everything as I go

402
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:02,100
through I really try to look at okay

403
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:05,009
well how would this do for somebody in a

404
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,620
more extreme climate and I try to really

405
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:09,179
go for things that are Hardy in all ways

406
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,479
and that's one of the things that's made

407
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:16,019
me wind up with strains that are so high

408
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,230
in terpenes because terpenes are oily

409
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:23,250
and strains that produce a lot of oil

410
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:27,028
tend to do a little bit better in say

411
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,190
the rain or the fog because they're it's

412
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:30,210
almost like it's like water off a duck's

413
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,070
back you know

414
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,419
the rain falls on them and it just it

415
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:38,129
just comes off you know so um so yeah

416
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,470
it's interesting because it's such a

417
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,690
great climate for the finished product

418
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,630
and yet it is kind of a challenging

419
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,360
climate as a farmer it kind of like a

420
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,970
survival of the fittest

421
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,159
is like well if it does well on your

422
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,960
property it's going to be thriving and

423
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,929
that the Terps are high because it's got

424
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,610
a really strong immune system and so

425
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:02,540
then it's attractive attractive to our

426
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:06,379
human nose too so you're you know big

427
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:09,619
the combination of of the difficulty and

428
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,080
also the you know your terroir means

429
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:14,029
that that the the strains that you're

430
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,678
breeding are probably going to be pretty

431
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:17,178
good you know pretty bulletproof just

432
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,540
about anywhere unless you you know

433
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:22,100
change temperature humidity in a big way

434
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:24,889
yeah it's it's really neat it's almost

435
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:27,129
kind of like like a magical thing you

436
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,600
know to look at it and go okay well

437
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:34,010
there's all these things that have come

438
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:35,629
together to make you know to delete lead

439
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:38,869
things down the past that they've gone

440
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:41,200
down because you know it's everything

441
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:45,439
has been underground for a long time so

442
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,319
people don't necessarily know uh like

443
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,298
Mendocino County it's not people at this

444
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:54,168
point maybe people still are you know

445
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:56,720
saying Oh Amsterdam or uh you know these

446
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:59,570
different places where people know about

447
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,429
a lot of weed or even like humble

448
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:05,480
humbled has been known for a long time

449
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:10,370
and Mendocino and Humboldt Trinity

450
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:13,730
Sonoma Monterey County there's really

451
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:16,250
been a lot of really great strains that

452
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,589
have come out over the years again and

453
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,630
again there's just all this stuff and I

454
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:22,339
feel like part of it comes from the

455
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,160
people who live here of course not more

456
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:30,319
experienced and do more stuff but I

457
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:32,000
think also the climate of this area like

458
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,009
I said you know if you have this stuff

459
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,569
if your weed is greasy it does better in

460
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:38,629
the weather and the fact that we have a

461
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:40,369
little bit of a more extreme climate I

462
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,080
think that you know that in all of these

463
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:43,428
areas that might be that might be

464
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,500
pushing that a little bit you know

465
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,940
yeah right on that makes sense hey let's

466
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,679
go ahead and take our first short break

467
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,840
and be right back you're listening to

468
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,140
shaping fire and my guest today is Mean

469
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,230
Gene master cannabis breeder at Freeborn

470
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,480
selections we'll be right back

471
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,370
as cannabis normalization sweeps the

472
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,259
country knowledge of how to grow

473
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:04,058
cannabis naturally and without synthetic

474
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:07,298
inputs has become more and more

475
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:09,069
available in fact probiotic growers are

476
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:11,139
experiencing large yields and

477
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:13,230
exceptional terpene profiles without

478
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,120
using chemicals banned in their state

479
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:19,058
move away from the risks inherent to

480
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:22,058
chemical nutrients and instead invest in

481
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:24,579
your soil use your soil again and again

482
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:26,970
reducing costs and improving the

483
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:30,279
vitality of your soil with each cycle

484
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,919
keep it simple organic has been a leader

485
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,470
in aerated compost teas for years and

486
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,900
now provide premium soils and nutrients

487
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,940
to the cannabis industry they offer a

488
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,040
full line of all-natural inputs for

489

communities and brewing nutrient and

491
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:49,330
compost teas they can even help you test

502

we humans are attracted to plants

503
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,779
because they offer us relief and are a

504
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,820
whole lot of fun sometimes though the

505
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,950
best parts are buried inside the plant

506
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:29,319
and we need to use specialty extraction

507
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,330
technology when it comes to cannabis it

508
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,519
is extraordinarily important to extract

509
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:35,798
its precious oils without changing them

510
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,900
in the process we want to preserve the

511
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:39,789
properties of the cannabinoids terpenes

512
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:43,660
and other constituents that all work

513
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:45,369
together since 1994 Eden labs has been

514
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,230
developing extraction technology and

515
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:49,808
processes to do just that

516
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,669
Eden labs was founded by a cannabis

517
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,950
loving engineer during the early days of

518
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:56,530
medical marijuana in California and the

519
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,509
expanded Eden team has been designing

520
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:00,579
and building industry-leading solutions

521
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:03,579
for cannabis extraction ever since

522
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:06,369
Eden labs flagship product is the newly

523
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:08,500
improved high flow co2 extractor as

524
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:09,519
other extraction companies enter the

525
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,710
market it is

526
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,180
hi flow from Eden labs that everyone

527
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,759
chases and tries to compare themselves

528
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,769
with not only that but the improved

529
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,009

568
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:53,169
I'm your host Shango Lowe's and our

569
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:55,089
guest this week is Mean Gene Master

570
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,460
Canada's breeder at Freeborn selections

571
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:59,230
so Jean before the break we were talking

572
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,380
about the importance of weather and

573
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:04,839
terroir there on your very specific

574
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,880
mountain where you grow and you know a

575
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:09,099
lot of people take your seeds and they

576
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,310
bring them indoors so you know it begs

577
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:15,009
the question you know do you have a part

578
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:16,929
of your breeding process that that comes

579
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,640
indoors I mean do you do any sifting

580
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,480
indoors are you doing all your sifting

581
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,470
outdoors well I mean you know in certain

582
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,610
cases it's

583
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:29,890
nice to do certain work with clones that

584
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:32,259
have been proven again and again indoors

585
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,490
to be really stable because then that

586
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,220
way you know that you're at least

587
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,500
getting part of your gene pool is coming

588
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:42,329
from something that's tried-and-true

589
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:46,329
indoors I do a little bit of breeding

590
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:48,250
indoors or in a like indoor outdoor kind

591
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:50,980
of environment meaning that it's like a

592
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,980
you know like a green a winter green

593
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,380
house with supplemental lighting which I

594
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:59,079
honestly think is better for stress

595
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,450
testing for indoors than actual indoor

596
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:04,000
scene because it's a lot harder to keep

597
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:06,700
the environment really dialed in yeah

598
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,259
because it really swings exactly and you

599
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,179
get you know you will get those lower

600
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:12,400
temperatures and you will get some of

601
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,110
the higher temperatures and you know

602
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,179
it's a little bit harder to keep it like

603
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:18,399
you know if I if I was running an indoor

604
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:20,710
it's really easy to go okay I'm 76

605
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,559
degrees all the time night and day

606
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:31,779
that's all it is and and that's cool for

607
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:35,408
me because um indoor where I live has

608
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:37,808
kind of gone it's kind of gone out years

609
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:41,140
and years ago there's people who do it

610
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:44,440
but as soon as people were able to grow

611
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,500
out in the open and the Sun and the

612
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,720
prices started coming down for people

613
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,450
what started to happen is it became a

614
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,519
lot more efficient for people to start

615
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:58,558
running light depths and running

616
00:25:54,519 --> 00:26:01,599
greenhouses and running outdoor and so

617
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,629
what I do basically is I try to breed

618
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:08,829
stuff outdoor because in my experience

619
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:11,020
if it does if it if it does good indoor

620
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:12,519
it's going to do great outdoor so like I

621
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,579
said if I'm starting with some of those

622
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:18,158
some of those genetics you know

623
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:20,548
different you know oh geez or mass

624
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,440
Turkish Hindukush

625
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:25,869
different things that that they you know

626
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,850
they do perform well indoor and then I

627
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:29,678
incorporate those into stuff that I have

628
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:31,869
coming from outdoor but a lot of the

629
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,200
genetics that I had that we're coming

630
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:36,969
from outdoor were a ski a knee based and

631
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,298
so when you take them and you put them

632
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,368
into

633
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:41,288
they do great you know so stuff that I

634
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:44,019
the stuff that has more of a problem

635
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:46,179
going indoor is ironically the stuff

636
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:52,149
that's coming from indoor like the chem

637
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:56,080
dog the Sour Diesel some of the og Girl

638
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:58,359
Scout cookies cherry pie those are the

639
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,339
things that you know even when you bring

640
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,079
them into an outdoor breeding program

641
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:03,819
you go through Mandy go oh some of these

642
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:09,398
here they you stress them a little bit

643
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:12,878
and they say go intersex on you so you

644
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:16,569
know what I do is I is I mainly breed

645
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:19,898
outdoor because if it looks really good

646
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:22,388
outdoor and it smokes really good

647
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:23,678
outdoor when somebody takes it indoor if

648
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:26,288
they do it the right way

649
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,070
indoor has potential to have a little

650
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:32,798
bit more of what like what I always call

651
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:35,439
like the perfume on it like if you grow

652
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:38,200
outdoor OG it's very earthy and robust

653
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,570
and it's nice that's a great smell but

654
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,999
good indoor OG has this little added

655
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:45,700
little spectrum of terpenes that seem to

656
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:47,739
show up that are detectable it looks a

657
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,519
little prettier it's a little shinier

658
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:54,460
it's a little the resin tends to look a

659
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:57,159
little bit more light-colored and so I

660
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:00,429
try to find the stuff that when I when I

661
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,799
breed an outdoor it looks almost like

662
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:05,080
it's indoor you know and I want to say

663
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:09,489
like oh this will pass for indoor but

664
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:13,358
it's in that ballpark you know so then

665
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:17,139
what I do is I'll have people go ahead

666
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:22,989
and grow them out indoor and as far as

667
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:25,808
I've seen so far a population that you

668
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:28,989
can grow really stressed outdoor or in a

669
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:31,028
greenhouse and it stays stable and

670
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:33,159
doesn't show any signs of intersex when

671
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:36,339
you take that and a good grower grows at

672
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:39,190
indoor it's going to do just as good as

673
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:41,589
far as sexual stability indoor as it

674
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,528
does outdoor everything that I have that

675
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:46,990
is problematic indoor it's problematic

676
00:28:44,528 --> 00:28:49,509
outdoor if it's stressed you know if

677
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,099
it's over watered if it's too hot in a

678
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:54,579
greenhouse or whatever it

679
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:57,969
is so for me for breeding I do pretty

680
00:28:54,579 --> 00:29:00,519
well being able to do it all outside and

681
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,169
then do a lot of testing inside you know

682
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,179
yeah right on that makes a lot of sense

683
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:07,030
one of the things that I enjoy doing is

684
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:09,940
over the winter I'll I'll play with some

685
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:12,819
some new seeds and strains that I've

686
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,769
never you know used before and you know

687
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:16,750
see what they do indoors but in the at

688
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:19,119
the end of the day for my own head

689
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,429
I really like the terpene profiles that

690
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,649
come from full on sunshine you know I

691
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:25,600
mean my LEDs are great and and you're

692
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,900
right there are all sorts of really nice

693
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,519
attributes of growing indoors and you

694
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,929
know it's kind of like training an

695
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,849
Olympian right your training and

696
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:35,890
training for a very specific thing and I

697
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:38,230
can control everything and I end up

698
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,419
getting this good product but but I also

699
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,240
like that little bit of a you know that

700
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:45,340
that wild outdoor taste with from the

701
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,929
broader spectrum of the sunshine so you

702
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:48,339
know whatever whatever I find over the

703
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:50,559
winter that I love the best I'll take it

704
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:52,480
outside and see it express itself that

705
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,970
way and you know I think that's just a

706
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,380
fun thing of being able to go indoor and

707
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,650
outdoor that you can see both

708
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,880
expressions yeah I think so too and I

709
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,700
and I know what you mean about the

710
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,720
outdoor I mean like personally for me um

711
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:09,788
I only know a few people I know a lot of

712
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,058
growers and there's only a few people

713
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:18,250
who's indoor is something that I would

714
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:22,869
want to smoke above outdoor you know I

715
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:25,750
mean if it's it's a lot of people say

716
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:28,449
okay indoor is always better and for me

717
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,460
I'm like if I'm going to see a hundred

718
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,679
samples of indoor and a hundred samples

719
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,409
of outdoor I'm probably going to like

720
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:39,250
five of the outdoor and two of the

721
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:41,289
indoor you know because outdoor

722
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:45,429
everything just kind of thrives and it

723
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:47,829
works and indoor a lot of times stuff is

724
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:50,500
just really washed out and you can tell

725
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:52,210
that there's too much heat and it just

726
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,250
doesn't look it doesn't look like it's

727
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,429
healthy and that that happens a lot you

728
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,798
know and then I notice outdoor although

729
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:02,200
indoor the resin might be more visible a

730
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:05,019
lot of times the outdoor it's actually

731
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,819
more of these thick almost like

732
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:09,339
sheets of resin where the trichomes are

733
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:13,599
almost sticking together and like globs

734
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:16,179
and I you know for me like if I if I

735
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:20,109
smoke in door I'm going to be I'm going

736
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:24,789
to be high for you know maybe an hour

737
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:26,769
and if I smoke if I smoke outdoor and of

738
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:28,450
course it's genetics or it's hugely

739
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:29,950
dependent on genetics you know some

740
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,660
stuff no matter what it's going to get

741
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,950
you high for like four hours if it's got

742
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:38,920
some crazy haze or something but I

743
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:41,830
really like the high from the outdoor to

744
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:45,070
me it really just hits me and it stays

745
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:47,349
and I can really feel it and it's not

746
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:50,019
just like this little rush of stuff you

747
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:52,059
know so yes I also find that you know at

748
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:55,569
you know I still consider myself a

749
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:58,089
novice grower and growing outdoors is

750
00:31:55,569 --> 00:32:00,519
just so much more forgiving you can make

751
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:03,250
simple mistakes endure and end up with

752
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,019
big problems but but outdoor you know

753
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,210
you've got you've got you know pests

754
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:09,009
predators naturally outdoors you've got

755
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,470
the sunshine to help you with some of

756
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:14,140
the molds so long as I don't have you

757
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,100
know extensive fog I'm you know I know

758
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,070
I'm going to be in pretty good shape

759
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:21,099
outdoors whereas indoor something can go

760
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:23,049
bad fast yeah it seems like outdoor the

761
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:26,169
environment is forgiving enough that as

762
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:29,829
long as you as long as you handle it and

763
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:31,870
dry it correctly you know as long as

764
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:32,889
it's properly dried and handled you're

765
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:36,459
going to have something that's really

766
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:38,710
nice but when you're indoor it's almost

767
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:42,579
like the whole process of flowering is

768
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:45,069
like a curing process if your room you

769
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:46,869
know outside your stuff can be budding

770
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:48,789
and it gets up to 90 degrees and you're

771
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:50,769
fine but if you're growing in door and

772
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:53,680
your room is sitting 90 degrees all the

773
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:57,339
time it's like when your weed is finally

774
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:00,130
done it's just going to be um you know

775
00:32:57,339 --> 00:33:02,139
it's just so tired it's just a yeah it's

776
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,240
just there's nothing substantial anymore

777
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,920
about about the residents profile you

778
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,650
know it's like when when I stay in the

779
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,330
Sun too long you know like oh that I

780
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:14,280
need to go take a cold shower somewhere

781
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:17,359
yeah yeah so so you know every breeder

782
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,399
has got those specific Canada

783
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,159
plant attributes that turn them on the

784
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,230
most and and you know if it's a regional

785
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,360
thing and it's also a breeder thing what

786
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,179
you look for when choosing plants that

787
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:31,819
excite you that you want to work with

788
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:34,970
further well you know for me it's like

789
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:37,279
um experience leads me a lot like I can

790
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,500
look at a plant in the loo that's one of

791
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,619
those plants that gets the big buds all

792
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,298
the way inside of the plant or whew

793
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:47,779
that's one of those plants that doesn't

794
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:49,668
need a lot of support or that's one of

795
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:51,500
the ones that's shaped that certain way

796
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:55,610
where I know it's just going to get tons

797
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,950
of tons of buds all over it or you know

798
00:33:55,609 --> 00:34:02,599
the main thing for me as far as like

799
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:05,000
what what defines the quality of a

800
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:07,639
strain is really what do you wind up

801
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,480
with in your bag when it's all said and

802
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:15,079
done so for me what I want is the ones

803
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,030
that have that crazy I'm really you know

804
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:20,539
I mean for a lot of people it's all

805
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,490
about well is it it is it's Tony what's

806
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:25,599
it do to you what are the effects and I

807
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:29,269
can appreciate that and I respect that

808
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,210
mindset a lot but like honestly for us

809
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:35,840
growing up here like when we were

810
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:39,378
smoking a lot um we would smoke so much

811
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,869
that it wasn't a matter of okay well we

812
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:44,659
only have this four grams weed how high

813
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:47,450
is it going to get us so we really got

814
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:50,599
into flavors and smells a lot and I

815
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:54,339
really like I really like the flower um

816
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:56,960
just for aesthetics aside from actually

817
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:59,090
consuming it or doing anything with it I

818
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,789
like to sit and I like to hold it I like

819
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:04,400
to smell it I mean the same way people

820
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:08,000
like like cut flowers like if you like

821
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,210
um you know whatever tuberose or

822
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,150
gardenias or you know whatever kind of

823
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:16,369
flowers that are nice just because you

824
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,889
can sit and smell them I think of I

825
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:20,960
think a weed like that so I want to I

826
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:25,368
want usually to have it be something

827
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,429
where when I have it I really enjoy how

828
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:30,980
it looks and then I really enjoy how it

829
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:36,230
smells and I like the ones that

830
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:38,840
are really special in that if you smell

831
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,940
them and you didn't know it was weed you

832
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:44,809
might not know that that was a weed

833
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:46,909
smell you know yeah uh so that that's

834
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:49,969
what that leads me a lot but then it

835
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:52,039
comes down to on top of okay what is it

836
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:52,579
in the bag it's also what is it in the

837
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:55,369
garden

838
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:58,130
so is it fun to grow or is it a

839
00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:00,170
nightmare to grow you know and so

840
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,150
anything that's where I say that's why I

841
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,820
say experiences led me it's like I look

842
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,680
at a plant and I go oh this one's going

843
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,960
to be a pain in the butt you know or

844
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,579
move this one's going to be a dream and

845
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,858
I'm going to be happy just to go work

846
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:14,929
with these plants every day so if I have

847
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:17,539
something and I say oh I like this one

848
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:19,519
you can bet that the plant is going to

849
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:22,789
be fun to grow it's going to be fun to

850
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:26,989
look at it's probably going to be fun to

851
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:28,969
harvest and it's also going to be fun to

852
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:31,608
have it dried in your bag

853
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:34,219
yeah yeah right on your your black line

854
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:37,849
Reserve was a you know a homerun by

855
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:39,739
anybody's standards and I'm grateful to

856
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:41,420
have been able to sample it a few times

857
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:44,419
you know it's like it's got that bright

858
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,389
lime and coconut and fruit over over

859
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,389
like a bed of like soothing herbs and

860
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:53,509
moss you know its plays both ends of the

861
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:55,699
spectrum yeah and it's not like you know

862
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,230
like when you when somebody says can you

863
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:59,899
taste the fruit continue and you're like

864
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:02,358
oh maybe I can wear it where's the lime

865
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,730
it's like boom you know it's like it's

866
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:06,469
like a you know a green pop stick a lot

867
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,119
of the out of the fridge that that

868
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:10,669
you're that out of the freezer that that

869
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,410
point you know what what did what went

870
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,590
into that you know since it's probably

871
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:16,489
the strain that you know I would say

872
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:19,160
nationally you're probably most

873
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:20,419
associated with you just just gives us a

874
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:23,059
little bit of background of the black

875
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,730
line okay so the deal with that was that

876
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:28,608
that release was a clone that I keep

877
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:36,440
that I call lime number one and what it

878
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:37,880
is is uh it's a PK two og type because

879
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,429
there's a couple different kinds of PK

880
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,550
but the one I used was a oh g type and I

881
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:44,449
I crossed it with what I called black

882
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:49,789
lime

883
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:50,389
and what black lime was was I I had

884
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,369
these plant

885
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:56,809
I had these seeds and I got on my sink

886
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:59,420
96 or 97 I got the I got the two

887
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:01,489
different kinds of seeds and one of them

888
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,720
I was working with my buddy and he

889
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:08,659
actually got one side of it which was an

890
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:10,789
old strain that was a lot of a lot of

891
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:14,149
chemical smells really deep really heavy

892
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:16,789
a lot of skunk enos really toxically

893
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:19,880
stony to the point where like if

894
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:22,460
somebody's drinking alcohol like smoking

895
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,079
that is a no-no like four beers and two

896
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,789
hits of that and you're probably going

897
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,699
to be laying in the bushes throwing up

898
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:31,279
you know it was really really strong and

899
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:33,829
we called it pong for purple orange and

900
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,730
green I didn't come up with it my buddy

901
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:42,019
did and it was it was old genetics that

902
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:45,380
were that work that came from my family

903
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:47,809
in the 80s and got recycled through a

904
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:51,890
couple people and then came back to us

905
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:54,110
and um you know it was kind of like just

906
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:56,480
the regular stuff to me and I didn't

907
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:58,039
really you know I didn't really hold it

908
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,769
at a high value because none of it was

909
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:05,000
pure anymore it had become this old oil

910
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:07,579
cans strains crossed with which was a

911
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,110
which was a walk and Afghani crossed

912
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,539
with the Northern Lights that was a

913
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,920
clone we gave them for years and and

914
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:14,269
this guy did this breeding and then me

915
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,659
and my buddy worked for me got some

916
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:20,719
seeds so there's that side of it which

917
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:23,119
is this really deep heavy nasty gross

918
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:27,169
thing but it was it was amazing but it

919
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:30,109
was just crazy you know and and then I

920
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:35,590
had I worked for for another friend of

921
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:38,660
mine and I I was silk-screening

922
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:41,470
people's trim back then to make him hash

923
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:43,730
you know and I was pressing the hash and

924
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:45,409
people were like whoa this is like old

925
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,210
school hash from back in the day you

926
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:50,889
know and this is like I started doing

927
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:53,990
this in like 94 95 this guy from Lebanon

928
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:55,279
showed us how to do it how to press it

929
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:56,779
you know and we're like oh that's really

930
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,860
neat you can press it because of course

931
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,660
if you have

932
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,769
good hash you compress anything but he

933
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:02,929
showed us how to press anything

934
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:06,409
basically that could be pressed to make

935
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:08,569
dark sticky nice hash um using heat and

936
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:11,029
everything and so I was doing that and

937
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,230
so I went through the guy's stuff and as

938
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,910
I'm going through I go hey there's some

939
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,490
seeds in these are these good you know

940
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:18,319
and he goes yeah I'll give you some

941
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:20,269
other seeds though but if you want them

942
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,070
you know I mean you can try and he goes

943
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:23,659
but there nothing I did on purpose so

944
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,120
who knows what they really are they're

945
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:31,670
just seeds and like a rounding error for

946
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:33,469
him yeah so uh so I take the I take the

947
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,990
one I take the one and I take the other

948
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:40,789
and now the Paul guy knows good so I

949
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:42,409
grow it out the other one which at the

950
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:45,949
time I didn't know what it was I just

951
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:48,079
knew it was like Afghani and uh and

952
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:50,269
later on I found out there was Northern

953
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,579
Lights in it and then even more recently

954
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:54,289
only like last year I was talking to the

955
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,969
guy goes and I was talking to a friend

956
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:57,829
who had been talking to the guy I got it

957
00:40:55,969 --> 00:41:00,739
from and he goes hey did you know he had

958
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:02,929
used the the old Burmese in there from

959
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:04,849
so-and-so and I go no I never he never

960
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:06,739
told me that he goes yeah I was he goes

961
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:08,960
we went further down the rabbit hole you

962
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:10,879
know we got down the worm hole or

963
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,039
something like that and he goes then all

964
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,780
of a sudden you know this is more info

965
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,309
pops out and he's got the Burmese in

966
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,490
there the old branch camber beef and I

967
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:21,199
was like oh okay and so that made a

968
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:23,299
little bit of sense too for there to be

969
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,389
some else in it because it was so exotic

970
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:30,670
this other thing was always like

971
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:33,230
grapefruit or cranberry or lime or

972
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:42,349
something just always really nice you

973
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:44,119
know and so so of course the ones I knew

974
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:45,739
were pretty good because the POG my

975
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:47,210
buddy had bred a couple times and he

976
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:51,409
said oh these are all really good now

977
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:53,210
and so I did a seed patch garden and

978
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:55,670
what I did was I went okay well here's

979
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,769
the here's the one that I know is great

980
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,970
I'm gonna keep the males from these and

981
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:01,519
here's the one that came out of that

982
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:03,589
shake I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of

983
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,849
those males because I don't know yeah I

984
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:06,620
don't know what's gonna come out of this

985
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:09,170
stuff cuz the guy who gave it to me he

986
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:11,029
said he didn't know you know yeah so he

987
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,720
only grew one thing but he just wasn't

988
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,670
he is like

989
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:15,559
probably not my keeper plants those are

990
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,608
probably the more wimpy ones because

991
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:20,449
it's the prey you have to focus

992
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:23,539
somewhere yeah yeah so so I get those

993
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:25,489
and I grow them and out of the ones that

994
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:27,409
were the citrusy ones I got a couple

995
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:30,009
really nice big beautiful plants that

996
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:33,230
were just what I would have wanted but

997
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:36,079
interestingly enough the worst plant in

998
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,639
the whole thing that was all one of

999
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,589
those ones that if you looked at all the

1000
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,629
plants and you go okay well there's a

1001
00:42:39,588 --> 00:42:45,588
dozen of them let's get rid of the

1002
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:47,660
weakest one that was the one that wound

1003
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:53,659
up smelling like it smelled like tie

1004
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:55,429
line you know and so I er like you're

1005
00:42:53,659 --> 00:42:58,460
like buck up campers you got some work

1006
00:42:55,429 --> 00:43:00,500
to do you need to bounce back oh yeah no

1007
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,510
I mean it was it was basically like okay

1008
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,900
well and and typically in breeding the

1009
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:08,780
way I do things is this if I get boys

1010
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,490
that are really really really weak or

1011
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,819
there's something that I really don't

1012
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:17,358
like about them I'll go ahead and kill

1013
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:19,099
males but and this is for open

1014
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,719
pollination of course I do selective

1015
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:23,000
line breeding too or you only use one

1016
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,139
male but in this case it was just we

1017
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,909
were just trying to make a whole bunch

1018
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:28,848
of seed with this stuff and just kind of

1019
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:30,980
see what we get so I wound up killing I

1020
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:33,079
want I wound up killing all the males

1021
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,619
from the citrusy stuff and from the

1022
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:38,240
fuelie stuff I wound up keeping maybe

1023
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:39,740
three or four males I don't remember

1024
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:44,868
there was a bunch of them there and I

1025
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:46,789
killed most of them and so so when I

1026
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:48,710
have females even if the females look

1027
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:50,989
bad I keep them just in case they have

1028
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,670
something really cool because it's not

1029
00:43:50,989 --> 00:43:54,439
going to water down the gene pool

1030
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,690
because it's easy to keep the seeds from

1031
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,700
a female separate but when you have a

1032
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,409
lot of males together you can't keep

1033
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:04,159
them separate their pollens all going to

1034
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:06,049
mix right right so whereas I call a lot

1035
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,269
of the male population I don't pull out

1036
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,710
much of the females unless there's

1037
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:11,659
something really bad about them like

1038
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,519
maybe if they get like a stem rot or

1039
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:15,379
something that I just I just don't want

1040
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,329
to have nothing to do with even growing

1041
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,039
at one time but if I'm willing to grow

1042
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:21,289
the plant one time and it's a female

1043
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,539
it's going to stay and so it was just

1044
00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:24,949
this wimpy little plant its buds when

1045
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:25,489
they were finished were only about as

1046
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:28,759
bigger

1047
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:30,409
my son none of them were long and they

1048
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,290
had these tiny little leaves and these

1049
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:35,389
thin little stems and it gets all the

1050
00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:37,429
way I think it was a boy was a Burmese

1051
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:39,289
throw back judging by what was in

1052
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:41,960
everything and it gets all the way to

1053
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:44,210
the end and it gets this incredible

1054
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,039
smell to this day it's still my favorite

1055
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,289
smell and it does it comes out of the

1056
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:51,409
line but there's not a ton of them in

1057
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:54,349
there because the lime was the cross of

1058
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:57,230
this weird plant that was there and it

1059
00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:58,670
was already kind of a sport and then I

1060
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:02,030
had crossed it was something that was in

1061
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:07,880
a totally different world of flavor so

1062
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:12,410
um anyway uh what ended up happening was

1063
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:17,119
I labeled it I labeled all the plants so

1064
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:22,429
I had like tall purple um tall purple

1065
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:25,010
cranberry um tall green fat Northern

1066
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:29,029
Lights you know and then this one plant

1067
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:32,570
it smelled like lime and it turned black

1068
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:35,180
in the fall so on the package of seeds

1069
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,769
which was a bag of seeds that you know

1070
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:38,809
Jesus was a lot you know it's a lot of

1071
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:40,159
seeds I made it was a whole imagine you

1072
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:41,869
know it's a whole garden full of

1073
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,489
six-foot plants and they're all fully

1074
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:46,820
seated you know yeah that's a lot a

1075
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:51,169
release right there yeah it was a lot of

1076
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:52,910
seeds and so so that that's what it

1077
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,769
wound up getting labeled as as the blast

1078
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:56,539
so that I would know which planet was oh

1079
00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:58,759
this was the plan that smelled like lime

1080
00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:00,739
and it was and it turned black so that's

1081
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,380
where the name black lime came from it

1082
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:05,599
wasn't like let's get a wonderful dinner

1083
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:07,460
really think is cool or whatever it's

1084
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,589
like no it's just it's just off of my

1085
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,659
label which is how most of my names come

1086
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,730
about I just I write him down for

1087
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:15,618
reference for myself and then people ask

1088
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,909
what it is and that's the only name for

1089
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:19,850
it and then the name sticks you know

1090
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:21,889
yeah so that was really where that came

1091
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:24,079
from and then I wound up taking a male

1092
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:25,549
out of that population when I planted

1093
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,889
some of them because the females came

1094
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:30,050
out really good and I didn't really

1095
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:31,519
expect him to be that crazy but they

1096
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:33,560
were they were amazing they were like

1097
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,599
the best stuff I've ever seen and then

1098
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,759
it started there started to be the og

1099
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,230
craze and so I went well let me take

1100
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,410
some of my different males and throw

1101
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,420
them

1102
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:43,519
oh geez and see if I get anything to

1103
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,920
come out oh gee which I didn't because

1104
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:49,369
all my stuff was so dominant over the og

1105
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,190
so I wound up with this basically with a

1106
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:55,280
plant that had does that did really good

1107
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:58,630
but it it it wasn't OG it still had all

1108
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,000
of the all of the terpene profile from

1109
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:03,920
from the middle ground of the of the

1110
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,829
black line so it has this really heavy

1111
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,019
chemical funk earth moss thing like you

1112
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:14,089
said and then it has all this really

1113
00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:15,769
beautiful floral limey citrus zest stuff

1114
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:18,108
going on you know and that's that's

1115
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:20,538
that's why it wound up being such a um

1116
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:22,000
such an odd thing because I really I

1117
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:24,049
took two things that were really

1118
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,449
different you know what I mean it was

1119
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:28,038
like peanut butter and bacon or you know

1120
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:30,169
it was it was a weird thing to put

1121
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:31,549
together so right on cool well thank you

1122
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,650
for sharing that story and that makes a

1123
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:35,719
lot of sense too because the the flour

1124
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,720
that I have you know it's it's this kind

1125
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:40,669
of you know blackish bluish almost

1126
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,068
iridescent and it's nice to hear the

1127
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,809
background behind it and we're going to

1128
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,429
go ahead and take a our second short

1129
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:48,079
break and be right back you're listening

1130
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:50,480
to shaping fire and my guest today is

1131
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,809
Mean Gene master cannabis breeder at

1132
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,460
Freeborn selections if you grow cannabis

1133
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:57,650
with sunshine you can often feel limited

1134
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:59,599
by the seasonal cycle you want to grow

1135
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:01,700
sustainably and save money so you use as

1136
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,440
little electricity as possible but if

1137
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:04,818
you haven't studied or implemented light

1138
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,230
deprivation techniques into your

1139
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:08,630
greenhouse you're leaving a lot of money

1140
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:10,010
on the table by incorporating light

1141
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,750
deprivation solutions into your

1142
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:13,400
greenhouse you can often add two or

1143
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:15,588
three additional growing cycles to your

1144
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,000
year when you pencil out the financial

1145
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:19,068
benefit of those additional cycles

1146
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,260
you'll realize why commercial scale

1147
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:23,869
light deprivation technology is remaking

1148
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:25,490
the cannabis industry what used to be

1149
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:27,289
done by pulling tarps over hoop houses

1150
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:28,669
has been scaled up over the last few

1151
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:31,099
years in such a way that it's become

1152
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:32,420
mechanized easy and affordable to even

1153
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:35,690

experts have been in the fields of

1160
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,690
Northern California for decades and

1161
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,399
they're now building greenhouses for

1162
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,840

1168
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,780
I talked with Eric about the importance

1169
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,760
of intelligent greenhouse management as

1170
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,400
well as the huge financial benefit of

1171
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,260
incorporating light depth techniques

1172
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,090
there are so many aspects of utilizing a

1173
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,950
greenhouse that can go wrong from

1174
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:15,079
temperature and airflow to light depth

1175
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,579

00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:48,650
work with go to shaping fire calm board

1191
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,240
/ FFG to find out more now that the

1192
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:51,440
health benefits of terpenes have become

1193
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,539
well known in the cannabis industry

1194
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,210
people everywhere are looking for the

1195
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:57,920
purest terpenes without adulterants the

1196
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,659
problem with most terpene providers is

1197
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,460
that they're not sourced naturally and

1198
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:03,649
instead are made as a byproduct of

1199
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:06,380
refining petroleum and that's so sketchy

1200
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:08,420
the terpenes sold by true terpenes are

1201
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,360
entirely different they are certified

1202
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,980
organic non-gmo and food grade that

1203
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,410
means that they are extracted from real

1204
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,630
plant sources there are no solvents of

1205
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:20,539
any kind they are distilled only with

1206
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,760
steam that's right only steam in fact

1207
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:25,219
terpenes from true turbines are so pure

1208
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,020
that you can eat them not only that but

1209
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:29,899
you can stack them with better results -

1210
00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:31,969
what I mean is other companies terpenes

1211
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,800
have got a few percent of impurities and

1212
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:35,869
when you stack those terpenes to make

1213
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,670
your blend you're adding a variety of

1214
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:40,009
impurities that degrade your final

1215
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:41,780
product true terpenes also have

1216
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:43,640

1217
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,980
range of cannabis strains like Durbin

1218
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:48,829

1242
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:40,309
back you are listening to shaping fire

1243
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:42,349
and I'm your host Shango Louis and our

1244
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:44,449
guest this week is Mean Gene master

1245
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,670
cannabis breeder at Freeborn selections

1246
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:49,039
so Jean you know I know that you've done

1247
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:51,800
some runs with aficionado and the

1248
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:54,469
aficionado stuff is all you know ultra

1249
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,960
premium elite and also in limited

1250
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:58,730
edition and you know that is an

1251
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,920
interesting aspect of it because it

1252
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:03,199
makes the seeds themselves more valuable

1253
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,480
but it also keeps it out of the hands of

1254
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,000
a lot of people so I'm just curious what

1255
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,940
your thoughts are on the limited nature

1256
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,579
of seeds like like do you are you

1257
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:15,559
attracted to the idea of a limited run

1258
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:17,139
so it's a little more rare or was that

1259
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:21,639
mostly just because that's the

1260
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:24,349
aficionado like premium model to release

1261
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:26,119
you know that's actually a concept it's

1262
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:28,159
kind of a double-edged sword with with

1263
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:32,029
doing stuff limited but it's a concept

1264
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:34,399
that I was supportive of because I've

1265
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:37,460
noticed over the years that if things

1266
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:41,030
are a little bit harder to get people

1267
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:43,579
tend to value value a more highly and

1268
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:46,400
take them more seriously which from a

1269
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:48,139
preservation point of view because

1270
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,389
that's really you know I'm really

1271
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:53,449
concerned with things staying around

1272
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:54,829
because I've seen so much stuff just be

1273
00:52:53,449 --> 00:53:00,649
gone and you never see it again

1274
00:52:54,829 --> 00:53:02,150
so to me I feel like if somebody gets a

1275
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:03,740
pack of seeds and they know that there

1276
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,720
was only ever a couple hundred of these

1277
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:08,029
packs released or there was only 50 of

1278
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:10,339
them released once they get it they're

1279
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:12,320
more likely to breed it and keep those

1280
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,539
seeds around and people are more likely

1281
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,700
to say oh I really

1282
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:18,559
to get that whereas if everybody's

1283
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:22,009
already seen it at everybody else's

1284
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,869
house they're more likely to go yeah I

1285
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:26,570
could get that anytime I'll grow that

1286
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:30,139
later you know yeah I mean I mean

1287
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:32,300
certainly when I see people at your at

1288
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:34,400
the aficionado booth at Emerald cup I

1289
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,320
mean people are treating these things

1290
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,329
like they are you know gifts from the

1291
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,880
gods because I mean not only are they

1292
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:43,190
paying you know serious money for them

1293
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,829
but you know really if you know that's

1294
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:48,740
all you're going to get and so you know

1295
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:51,049
it you're you're popping each one with

1296
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:53,209
intention and you're taking care of it

1297
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,880
and you just you know I know when I have

1298
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:59,119
got rare seeds i I just shower them with

1299
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,980
more love and care than I do if somebody

1300
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,199
gives me oh here this is my latest run

1301
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,599
here's fifty seeds of it you know yeah

1302
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,730
and I you know I use the analogy of dogs

1303
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,159
you know because I see a lot of you I

1304
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:12,199
see a lot of things a lot of parallels

1305
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:16,940
because you know breeding breeding dogs

1306
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:19,849
breeding seeds um like you know I I have

1307
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,650
a I always I always say hey you know

1308
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:24,110
like and it's the same with seeds with

1309
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:26,539
dogs I say hey go adopt a dog go get a

1310
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:28,550
dog at a shelter they're all good it's

1311
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:32,179
the same as seeds it's like hey go buy

1312
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:33,769
that $18 PACA seeds go tribe yeah

1313
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:36,199
plant those seeds that you found in the

1314
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:37,820
bud go plant those seeds that can't even

1315
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:40,129
it you know what I mean like just try

1316
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:42,440
them all and there's going to be there's

1317
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:47,269
going to be some stuff but I know for a

1318
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:49,820
fact that if if somebody goes and they

1319
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:52,730
and they go get a dog out of a cardboard

1320
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,830
box in front of a store you know they're

1321
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:56,719
going to be less likely to focus on that

1322
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:59,360
dog as much as if somebody says hey

1323
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,519
here's a $12,000 puppy somebody who buys

1324
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,079
a $12,000 puppy you think they're going

1325
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,329
to miss their shots and let them get

1326
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:06,949
parvo or they're not going to cut their

1327
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:09,590
toenails or they're not going to check

1328
00:55:06,949 --> 00:55:11,569
their dog's ears and teeth and you know

1329
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:14,300
what I mean like I have you know I have

1330
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:18,200
dogs I have one dog that's inexpensive

1331
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:20,330
you know highly bred like show dog tight

1332
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:22,909
pit bull and I have a mutt that's a

1333
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:26,110
Saint Bernard and blue pit bull mix and

1334
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:28,019
I treat them the same but I also treat

1335
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:30,269
crappy bag seeds

1336
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:31,590
that I find out of a bud that I think is

1337
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:33,719
a good bud to me

1338
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:36,329
finding that bag seed that's just like

1339
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:38,039
somebody saying hey here is a pack of

1340
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:41,549
seeds these are really expensive they

1341
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:43,619
didn't make very many you know so for me

1342
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,180
I have like that understanding that it

1343
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:46,440
could be anywhere but I know that

1344
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:49,529
there's a lot of people who don't think

1345
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,320
that way so I do understand the the

1346
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:54,360
value of telling somebody look these are

1347
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,280
very rare there's not a lot so that's

1348
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,730
like when the black Lyme reserve was the

1349
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,640
first thing that I put out publicly with

1350
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:04,530
aficionado I was like well you know I

1351
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:07,319
had a lot of them I could have put out a

1352
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:10,019
couple thousand packs but I knew that if

1353
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,610
I put out three hundred packs that

1354
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:14,070
people would take them more seriously

1355
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:16,410
and they would be more likely to clone

1356
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:19,260
once and when they get a keeper they'd

1357
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:20,909
be more likely to make more seeds and

1358
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,290
they'd be more likely to make crosses

1359
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:23,849
with the seeds because I like it when

1360
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:26,130
people do that stuff with my seeds I

1361
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:28,440
don't want to just put out across and

1362
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:30,180
have people go oh yeah that's cool

1363
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,940
what's the next one you know it's like

1364
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:34,949
the like you said people people act like

1365
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,659
they're gifts from the gods and like you

1366
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:41,129
know depending on whether people believe

1367
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:44,489
in God or a God or just the universal

1368
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:47,340
force or the spirit or whatever people

1369
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:50,009
believe we're we're getting our getting

1370
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,470
our life from you know those seeds are a

1371
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:55,110
gift from that force you know like that

1372
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:57,269
that's a major thing that like every

1373
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:59,789
type of every type of life form that

1374
00:56:57,269 --> 00:57:02,730
there is is special but these ones the

1375
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:04,460
outlets as much as cannabis I mean you

1376
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:09,090
know there's nothing that's really as

1377
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:11,099
helpful potentially to us as as cannabis

1378
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:12,960
can be I mean you got something here

1379
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:15,599
that can potentially if you find the

1380
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,599
right plant it could cure any disease it

1381
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,130
might just be a matter of finding oh

1382
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:22,799
okay well look this one produces this

1383
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:25,170
chemical and you know once you get it

1384
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,269
down to everybody only going oh yeah we

1385
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:29,490
just all grow oh gee or oh we just only

1386
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:32,280
grow sour we just only grow cookies

1387
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:34,619
that's fine but it gets to a point where

1388
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,240
you go well but what about all of this

1389
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:38,250
you know these plants they don't all

1390
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:41,309
grow by themselves we've we've adopted

1391
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:43,469
them into our cultures

1392
00:57:41,309 --> 00:57:45,900
then we keep them and then that means

1393
00:57:43,469 --> 00:57:47,819
that if all of a sudden we lose them

1394
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,490
it's like we've adopted them and then

1395
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:52,470
we've abandoned them you know so we

1396
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:54,389
become responsible for the gene pool

1397
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,519
because we've done these things to it

1398
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:59,969
and we've created all this really crazy

1399
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:02,309
diversity and then after a while then we

1400
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:05,909
go oh no no no and it just all gets it

1401
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:08,219
all gets left by the wayside and so you

1402
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:10,049
know there's there's there's like

1403
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:12,839
there's an aspect of things being

1404
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:15,960
thought after and so at this point now

1405
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:20,370
when I feel like okay people understand

1406
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:22,050
that if I have a breed and I say that

1407
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:24,719
it's really valuable and it's really

1408
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:27,510
special and it's worth growing people

1409
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:30,809
now more so than when I first release

1410
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:33,360
stuff people will believe me so I feel

1411
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:34,860
like now I can put out a lot of feeds

1412
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:38,519
and I can put out a lot of different

1413
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:41,730
strains and people will understand where

1414
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:43,199
I'm coming from in breeding that that

1415
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:45,809
these things are special so I don't

1416
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,909
necessarily have to say okay well this

1417
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:49,320
is so special like this and so so

1418
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:51,239
special because of that I can just say

1419
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:54,240
look this is really good this is worth

1420
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:56,549
having please if you buy them make more

1421
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:59,189
give them to your friends take clones

1422
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:00,750
keep it around because it's part of of

1423
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,610
what's going on you know so that's why I

1424
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,769
say it's like a double-edged sword where

1425
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:07,470
you go okay well it's good to have it be

1426
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:09,179
limited but at the same time you're

1427
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:11,250
going to miss some of these people who

1428
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:13,289
are out there who are preservationist

1429
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:15,179
who were hoping that they could get a

1430
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:17,400
pack and those guys didn't get a pack

1431
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:19,649
and some guys who just grew them out

1432
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,240
real quick and sold the weed without

1433
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:23,700
ever even smelling it because they heard

1434
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,769
it was a hot item those guys got some of

1435
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:27,449
the packs too so I want to be able to

1436
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:29,250
put them out so that both those I want

1437
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:31,230
to be the guys who want to get the seeds

1438
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:33,150
and they just want to hey I just want to

1439
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:35,070
grow a bunch of weed and I'm gonna make

1440
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:36,660
money and I'm going to look cool and

1441
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,550
this and that great get these cool

1442
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:40,109
strains but I want them to be able to

1443
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:43,560
also reach as many of the

1444
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:45,240
preservationist as as they can so that

1445
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:48,000
people get their hands on them and in

1446
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:49,559
you know 50 years or a hundred years or

1447
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,239
a thousand years from now there's

1448
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:53,309
somebody who's got these things and they

1449
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:55,019
go hey I don't know where these came

1450
00:59:53,309 --> 00:59:57,719
from but they're really cool

1451
00:59:55,019 --> 00:59:59,820
and uh they're valuable let's keep

1452
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,559
making more and you know that that's

1453
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:04,769
like a service to the to the plant

1454
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:07,289
because the plant is um you know they're

1455
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:09,090
like for me personally there's nothing

1456
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:12,210
in life that's ever done as much for me

1457
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:13,740
as a cannabis plant as you know yeah

1458
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:16,170
well amen to that and you know you're

1459
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:19,259
you know I I'm glad to hear that you

1460
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:21,990
like the idea that people are you know

1461
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,180
making crosses with your gear in order

1462
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:26,519
to you know preserve it in their region

1463
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:30,149
the the seed pack that I know that came

1464
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:32,880
up here near near me you know my buddy

1465
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:35,730
planned the four crosses well in advance

1466
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,769
so we had it all lined up and you know

1467
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:40,679
and so we got to try you know the

1468
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:43,170
original black line as you intended but

1469
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:44,940
then also you know four crosses and you

1470
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:46,740
know the black line is still in there

1471
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,740
you can still taste it but you know you

1472
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:52,409
could also get the variations and so so

1473
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:54,389
there's a lot of joy in that and and so

1474
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:55,980
you know let's let's uh let's wrap up

1475
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:58,829
with this you know there's a lot of

1476
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:02,250
folks who are listening today who aspire

1477
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:04,799
to be an elite breeder like you are and

1478
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:07,380
a lot of folks you know they're getting

1479
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,150
their start by you know just they've got

1480
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,559
two you know two strains that they like

1481
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,940
and then they cross them and they've got

1482
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,500
F ones and they share them with their

1483
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:16,139
friends and they feel good about that

1484
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,400
and so they you know they they pick up a

1485
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:19,469
breeding book and they get a little more

1486
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,050
serious but but you know you you've done

1487
01:01:19,469 --> 01:01:24,289
you've done it all now at this point so

1488
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:27,030
what advice do you have for folks

1489
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:29,759
willing to put in the work who want to

1490
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:32,040
follow on this path behind you what

1491
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,490
advice would you give them that can kind

1492
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:38,239
of help them along their way um my

1493
01:01:35,489 --> 01:01:43,529
biggest advice would be you know like uh

1494
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:47,459
do you know go with what really what you

1495
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:50,940
really really like a lot of people you

1496
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:53,070
know as like a commercial breeder I was

1497
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:55,050
talking to somebody and they were saying

1498
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,670
oh I just you know I just take I just

1499
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:59,310
take males and put them on these clones

1500
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:00,750
and like kinda you know like oh yeah

1501
01:01:59,309 --> 01:02:02,400
like that's not that and I was like well

1502
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:05,250
you know if you're going to make stuff

1503
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,650
repeat for other people I what I said I

1504
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:08,699
think uh if you want to please the crowd

1505
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:12,150
you got you got

1506
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:16,169
play the hits right yeah so that's a

1507
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:18,450
cool thing to do but if you're even if

1508
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:21,300
you are doing that you really want to go

1509
01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:24,118
with what you really like so the things

1510
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,800
that really uh that you really vibe with

1511
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,289
like alright this is something that I

1512
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:30,450
really like like you know I have a buddy

1513
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:31,980
who he's like I've seen all the weed

1514
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:33,838
I've seen all the Kush I've seen

1515
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:37,199
everything he goes I like granddaddy

1516
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:39,299
pert or herbal those are still the thing

1517
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,250
that I like I like perps I'm not into

1518
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,980
this Kush I'm not into this Diesel he's

1519
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:46,139
just like purple like if you're the guy

1520
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:48,780
who likes the purp then that's your

1521
01:02:46,139 --> 01:02:50,789
thing if that's your very favorite thing

1522
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:54,060
then be the guy who makes the purp

1523
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:57,239
crosses who makes the the strains that

1524
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:59,159
are based on purp and that have those

1525
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:02,189
things that you really like and then

1526
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,019
really really tune into that really tune

1527
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:06,358
into what you're vibing with because

1528
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:08,369
those good feelings that you're getting

1529
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:09,929
about something those are what are

1530
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:11,430
really telling you that that's what

1531
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:13,139
you're supposed to be doing that's how

1532
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:16,858
our intuition works and that's how

1533
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:19,049
that's how our our brain and our our you

1534
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:21,179
know everything is really is our whole

1535
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:24,119
energy is really wired to that like okay

1536
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:26,368
if you want to breed breed the things

1537
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:28,200
that you really like now you might if

1538
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:31,260
you want to do it like commercially you

1539
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:33,929
might have to think about okay well what

1540
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:36,359
where where is the place that there's

1541
01:03:33,929 --> 01:03:39,750
the overlap between these two these two

1542
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:41,279
groups of traits here okay everybody

1543
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:44,099
else wants it to be

1544
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,109
stony they want to get good concentrate

1545
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:47,550
production they want a plant that's easy

1546
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:49,889
to grow they want to plant this

1547
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:52,410
high-yielding they want disease

1548
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:54,929
resistance okay now so you know

1549
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:56,578
everybody wants those things so then now

1550
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:58,649
with the things that you really love

1551
01:03:56,579 --> 01:04:00,900
which might be like in my case I love

1552
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:03,960
stuff that's floral I love stuff that's

1553
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,210
spicy I love stuff that's earthy I love

1554
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,809
the smells that to me are like classy

1555
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:11,699
like to me like loud is cool but it

1556
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:13,710
doesn't have to be loud for me it needs

1557
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:15,809
to be special so that's like my little

1558
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:18,720
thing that I got going so it's got to be

1559
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:21,029
whatever you are really really into

1560
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,018
you've got to tune into that and make

1561
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:24,789
that be

1562
01:04:22,018 --> 01:04:27,159
what what you're working towards you

1563
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:31,539
know because that's the only way you can

1564
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:34,659
really do something well is to go is to

1565
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:36,729
be able to really be turned on by it

1566
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:38,798
