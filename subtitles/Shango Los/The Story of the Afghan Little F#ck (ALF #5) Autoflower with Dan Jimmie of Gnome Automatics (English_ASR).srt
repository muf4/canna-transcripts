1
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,559
hey there friends it is Shango from

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,360
shaping fire and I'm here again with Dan

3
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:17,039
Jimmy from gnome automatics and uh we're

4
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,960
going to talk about one particular uh

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,880
cultivar that he brought to Market

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,679
actually it's the very first uh plant

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,000
that he brought to Market and the reason

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,678
why we're going to talk about Alf today

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,679
specifically Alf number five um is

10
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:33,039
because you know over the years as Dan's

11
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,439
plants have become more and more popular

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,039
with autoflow Autoflower Growers

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,359
everywhere um more and more people are

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,600
interested in his original stuff where

15
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:46,159
where did his original um genetics come

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,879
from because if they like his stuff now

17
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,959
they're interested in going back a few

18
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:53,039
generations and and getting some of his

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,439
earlier stuff so they too can um can

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,879
work with those and and you know his

21
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:01,320
particular Al number five seeds um

22
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,118
haven't been available for some time and

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,879
you know um on the on the forums and and

24
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:08,118
Dan will tell me people ask him for him

25
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,478
at shows and everything so people still

26
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,040
really want that Al number five and so I

27
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,239
figured you know since I'm here anyway

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,560
might as well take a chance and um and

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,438
ask him to share with us um uh the

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,240
lineage of the AL number five um his

31
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,719
very first drop so Dan tell us about Al

32
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,839
number five oh Al number five and you

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,519
know I think we'll get this out of the

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,240
way everybody's asked this one question

35
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,560
and I remember coming over uh to one of

36
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,478
the vime events and you know it was one

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,118
of the times that I was actually

38
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,078
donating Alf number five so we could get

39
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,159
it out there get it to patients and you

40
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,000
asked what Alf stood for and if it was

41
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,200
related to the alien which it is not and

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,200
it actually has a backbone into why it's

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,560
called Alf and the genetic line it

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,320
stands for Afghan little [ __ ] Afghan

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
little [ __ ] Afghan little [ __ ] that's

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,398
way different than the the alien Al on

47
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,718
the TV show yeah yeah and the reason it

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,079
got that name is because the Afghan part

49
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:03,239
of it are different different lineages

50
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,319
of Afghan influence cannabis that have

51
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,758
been put into it so Alpha number one

52
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,519
alpha number two and Alpha number three

53
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,359
and Al number four came from Spain and

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,000
it's where I sourced the original Al

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,680
genetics from a breeder named mossi and

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,360
she did the work up to Al number four

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,319
which are four different Afghan

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,239
influenced cultivars that were

59
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,759
introduced into an auto so she had

60
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,920
breeding stock that she had her Auto

61
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,359
flowers she would take one Afghani

62
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,199
infuence one of the was mzar I may not

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,760
be pronouncing that right introduced

64
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,280
that into her Autoflower genetics that

65
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:40,120
made Al number two and then Al number

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,959
three I think was skunk number one I

67
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,439
believe on the lineage that's a little

68
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,319
that one was just a little hazy for me

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,598
because it wasn't talked much about but

70
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:50,000
the Banger that came out of that was Alf

71
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,039
number four which was deep chunk

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,598
introduced into the previous Alf lineage

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,598
and that's where the color started

74
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:59,119
happening and that's when the plants

75
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,280
started getting larger and that's when I

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,799
acquired them because I fell in love

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,400
with her patio she had these patio shots

78
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:10,640
in Spain and this is before AFM this is

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,439
you know like I met her icy mag days um

80
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,079
roll it up.org days you know like we

81
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,039
were bouncing around forms because we

82
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,480
would either get hated on people made

83
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,560
poke fun of us cuz we're messing with

84
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,679
utof flowers back years ago and people

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,598
were like autoflowers were disdained for

86
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,680
years and still are in a lot of circles

87
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,639
in a lot of circles they are but the

88
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,760
reputation is starting the people are

89
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,318
starting to come around to the

90
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,318
reputation because of the work that

91
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,839
we're putting into them you know so I

92
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:38,878
got I acquire alha number four from

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,560
Spain from mossi she um gave me she said

94
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,359
play with it do whatever you want to do

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,438
with it read with it that's why I'm

96
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,560
sending it to you I want it to carry on

97
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:48,560
I want this to be around and there was a

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,759
lot of there was a lot of potential the

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,000
actual FAL generation of my Alf number

100
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,798
four I'm not entirely sure of most

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,158
likely it was F9 or higher because her

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,120
patio shots like I was talking about a

103
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,919
minute ago were just these multipots of

104
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,438
Oto flowers and by multipot what I mean

105
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,958
is like several utos in one pot of these

106
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:11,799
black and purple Hues and it was

107
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,000
gorgeous to see and I wanted that and I

108
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,759
knew the genetic potential was there to

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
help me further on down the road so I

110
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,919
get Al number four it's time to make Al

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,399
number five to stick true to her

112
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:27,120
Heritage I added Baba Kush which is

113
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:30,120
another Inda SL you know style

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
broadleaf um cultivar to it

115
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,000
and that's when all the magic started

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
happening from the liftoff from my

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,600
genetics that's where there's pure Alpha

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,600
number five Anvil came from that line

119
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,240
and Cole miner's daughter came from that

120
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,439
line as well and you were talking a

121
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,160
moment ago like people want to get the

122
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,680
backstock they want Alf number five to

123
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,720
breed with because I've never feminized

124
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,519
it I'll never feminize it to keep it

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,440
true to its breeding Heritage and then

126
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,240
Anvil I get asked for constantly you

127
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,560
know which is a pedigree outside it was

128
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
a nice phenotype I mean Anvil is

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,879
everybody wants it cuz they want that

130
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,000
purple color everything that you cross

131
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,439
to Anvil comes out purple it does and it

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
also adds one other thing that people

133
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,439
really really like and that's size and

134
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,319
vigor hell yeah the structure is great

135
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,879
yeah Anvil gets big fast I mean some of

136
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,879
them do run 90 days or longer indoor but

137
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,680
you got to remember you're getting extra

138
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,079
veg time with them the plants are

139
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,400
getting bigger you're getting a bigger

140
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,359
Harvest and then of course those bones

141
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,038
are good to breed into anything else too

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
I don't offer her in regular seed

143
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,399
anymore I get asked for that in regular

144
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,599
seed it is going to come back so is Alf

145
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,439
but anva will come back feminized as it

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,319
has been locked into and then Al will

147
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,038
come back as regular soon I'm not going

148
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,560
to give dates I got one project I got to

149
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,318
finish yeah we know how uh seed products

150
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,280
are projects are it's like I'm going to

151
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,479
get back to that one of these days one

152
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,519
of days so then like like a decade later

153
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,719
you're like oh I should try to pop those

154
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,439
seeds you know yeah exactly what and for

155
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,160
preservation purposes too like I don't

156
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,680
want to sit on I mean I do a pretty good

157
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,439
job of preserving my seeds um I've

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,759
gotten seeds that are 10 years old to

159
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,399
Germany most recently was another batch

160
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,960
of alp number four which Mossy called

161
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,638
the dragon um I had a friend of mine

162
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:11,359
open them up he had the room to do it we

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,519
did video chat to help with selections

164
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,439
like two three times a week when flowers

165
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,560
started kicking in and I've done a

166
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,759
reproduction of those to keep them alive

167
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,280
so I'm going to search back through the

168
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,439
original dragons and I'm going to work

169
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,959
on Al number five it will be this winter

170
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,360
I've got the room and space to do it now

171
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,000
where I can isolate cultivar you've told

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,479
me a few different times just kind of

173
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,240
mentioning at uh the the impact that Alf

174
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,038
had on your breeding program can you

175
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,319
just describe like you know in principle

176
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,120
the impact that it had on your program

177
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,360
yeah so like in principle it improved

178
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,800
the program exponentially for me it gave

179
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,479
me good breeding stock it's like going

180
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,598
out and getting a good quarter horse you

181
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:52,038
know to breed with to work on a farm you

182
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,918
need I wanted a good Workhorse somebody

183
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:56,800
who is robust somebody who was going to

184
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,318
give me potential and have a diverse

185
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,879
past that I could potentially open

186
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,439
anything up and and when I started

187
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,560
introducing like the other like the

188
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,839
Bubba cush to it you know to make Alf

189
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,478
number five that's when it was kind of

190
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,079
like the gene pool busted open and it

191
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:14,360
gave me m m resistance size it gave me

192
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,000
new colors it gave me

193
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,400
um honestly gave me confidence to move

194
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,199
my seed lines forward is what it really

195
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,239
did you know I remember you asked me

196
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,319
earlier you know when did you drop and

197
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,960
how long ago was it I want to say around

198
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,960
4 4 and 1/2 years ago and I can

199
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,638
correlate that because of a conversation

200
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,758
I had with a dear friend of mine uh

201
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,519
Jordan shout out to Jordan he came to

202
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,160
visit me here and we went to a canacon

203
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,918
together because we're finally in legal

204
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,160
states and we realized quickly that

205
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,120
canacon was okay but it was a way to get

206
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,720
a bunch of free [ __ ] which was cool that

207
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,280
was pretty much the way it was out here

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,080
at at that time and he had a

209
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,119
conversation with me in the hotel that

210
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,519
night and he said remember getting ready

211
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,478
to get into the seat game make sure your

212
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,079
breeding stock is on lock there's a lot

213
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,079
of people out there trying to enter into

214
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,079
this they're throwing out Hermes they're

215
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,639
throwing out garbage crop

216
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,120
don't be that guy and that's that's

217
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
stuck with me forever and we're still

218
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,959
great friends you know but it's good to

219
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,800
have a friend to tell you that because

220
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:14,038
he values your reputation because he's

221
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,400
known you for so long mhm so um so uh

222
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,959
you saw the AL uh being grown by mossi

223
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,399
and you fell in love with it because of

224
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,560
what it was doing on her porch and so

225
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,918
then you brought it to the states and

226
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,360
you started working with it and added

227
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,680
Bubba Kush and then eventually um

228
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,080
brought other things to it to to really

229
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,479
kind of make the the original backbone

230
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,800
of your of your of your collection y um

231
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,200
uh what are you doing with lines from

232
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:45,159
Alf now you know Alf itself might be a

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,200
couple Generations back but uh what are

234
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,000
you working on now that is of that same

235
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,200
lineage

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,159
so Alf produced Co Miner's Daughter

237
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,440
which was a phenotypical isolation I

238
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:01,120
found matching parents and I worked it

239
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:04,440
uh it's at F5 now um

240
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,278
and it has been used to hybridize

241
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,200
several things as of recent because it

242
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,559
also holds the color it's very good at

243
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
hashing it's very good at mold of milary

244
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,000
resistance and bugs don't seem to bother

245
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
it too much which is kind of nice like

246
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,919
we've talked earlier I unfortunately

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,440
have to battle mites every year yeah

248
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:24,278
thrips not so bad um but my biggest foe

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,760
out here are the mites and it seems to

250
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:30,000
kind of like they stay away from it you

251
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,720
know and so Co miner's daughter lives in

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,958
304 um which is the pinkleberry cross

253
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,120
which you know pinkleberry Co Miner's

254
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,119
Daughter Co miner's daughter came from

255
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,440
Al so those picked up and then the oage

256
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,600
we talked about earlier which is behind

257
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,240
us here is my Bobby's Widow with coler's

258
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,680
daughter in it Bobby's

259
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,759
Widow is kind of like Co miner's

260
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:56,639
daughter in a sense

261
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:59,799
Bobby was born by using Alpha number

262
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,600
four and um

263
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,278
DM's White Widow is what made that

264
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,839
initial Bobby's Widow cross the reason

265
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,200
the Bobby was it's Bobby's Dragon was

266
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,240
because of it was a phenotypical

267
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,480
isolation she had done and as you can

268
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,600
kind of see here as we're

269
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,000
talking you can hear the mentorship

270
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,159
coming out she did multipots I love to

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,559
breed multipots you get a good idea of

272
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,159
what you're dealing with with a lion in

273
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,838
The Offspring um she did phenotypical

274
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,000
isolations is what's what I have done

275
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,399
when I took Al number five and I did

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
pure Al home miner's daughter and um

277
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,799
Anvil so her influences are kind of

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,919
still there as I progress forward with

279
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,479
Al number five and its variance MH um I

280
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,479
haven't had the the pleasure of coming

281
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,200
across MSI is she still in the game

282
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,200
she's still very active on an.net she is

283
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,519
still around um I talk to her every now

284
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,920
and again she's probably a little

285
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
frustrated at me right now I've got to

286
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,719
get some packs out to some Prize winners

287
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,560
um and I've been kind of swamped so I

288
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,320
haven't got those out I mean so I'm sure

289
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,000
she's a little little upset with me on

290
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,079
that one but they are coming I promised

291
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,720
everything's packed they just got to get

292
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,159
them to the post office yeah yeah I I

293
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,920
think that um I think that's something

294
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,399
that just about every breeder everywhere

295
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:11,000
has to say yes yes the packs are coming

296
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,320
out it's going to be all right yeah

297
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,278
they're coming and it's just like you

298
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,959
know a lot of people may or may not know

299
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,759
I have a 9o5 I'm a father we do coach

300
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:23,199
Sports I've got dogs I've got you know

301
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,559
the gome automatic side and you know I

302
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,079
have a house to take care of and a

303
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,799
family and everything so things can get

304
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,039
crazy from time to time so it's nice to

305
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,439
have a day where we can just sit and

306
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,078
chill and talk about this cuz it doesn't

307
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,920
happen often yeah no it doesn't happen

308
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,000
it doesn't happen enough luckily we just

309
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,360
live a fairy away from each other so

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,639
that helps you know you're you're my

311
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,560
closest uh cultivation buddy so um all

312
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,919
right so I guess in wrapping up I just

313
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,518
want to thank you for all the donations

314
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,838
you've made of the ALF number five to

315
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,159
viia the the Vashon Island uh patient

316
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,480
outward um Outreach group that that I

317
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,199
started out on Bashon where I live um

318
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,759
you know in the in the early days you

319
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,639
would just bring packs and and it's

320
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,480
interesting because um every now and

321
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,039
then I'll come across one of those packs

322
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,959
and they may or may not have seeds but

323
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,919
you know how sometimes in somebody's

324
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,679
like like Garden or Greenhouse like an

325
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,399
old pack from a prior year would be

326
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,319
sitting there and I'll pick one I'm like

327
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,320
holy [ __ ] you've got Alf and they're

328
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,920
like oh I love that plant you know I

329
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,959
need more vimium eating so I can get

330
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:23,559
more of those seeds but like two things

331
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,479
that are funny about that one is that um

332
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,879
people don't realize that like the AL

333
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,759
isn't for sale you know anymore right

334
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,720
and then and then the second thing is is

335
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:35,039
that um people don't know how close they

336
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,199
were to actually getting more Al because

337
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:41,360
you know um right before we had to take

338
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:42,958
the the the break during the whole coid

339
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,680
thing from having meetings because you

340
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,399
cannot bring like patients together in

341
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:52,519
that kind of environment um you actually

342

344
00:12:54,278 --> 00:13:00,039
to do with that next um but um but you

352
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,278
hands of patients and and not that that

353
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,079
they don't have to just grow like the

354
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:21,559
extras you know and the freebies so

355

thanks for that absolutely dude you know

356
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,078
and it's like you said it's always been

357
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,198
an important part of Who I Am with this

358
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,359
thing like the whole reason I started

359
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:31,120
growing cannabis was because of somebody

360
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,440
who was dying with cancer you know what

361
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,240
I mean it's the whole reason I got into

362
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,519
it and then I get introduced find that

363
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
you have these meetings on the island

364
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,360
and it was a very intimate setting and

365
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
you were bringing in resources and

366
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,240
people

367
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,000
and not only were they had safe access

368
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,639
they had access to Quality stuff they

369
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,958
also had access access to Quality

370
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,560
information to go along with it you know

371
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,879
and that that meant a lot to me so

372
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:57,078
making sure that um these parent these P

373
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,799
parents these patients have access just

374
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,799

375
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,958
purpose and why I do this sure I enjoy
