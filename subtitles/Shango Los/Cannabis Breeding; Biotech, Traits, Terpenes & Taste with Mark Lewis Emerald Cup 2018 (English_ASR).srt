1
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:21,399
oh right

2
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,339
looks like there were people shuffling

3
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:27,909
about and she said it my name is Mark

4
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:31,379
Lewis hello everyone why does it feel

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,379
like David o'clock in the morning snow

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,289
so I'm here to talk to you today about

7
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:44,560
cannabis breeding biotechnology terpene

8
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:48,640
these flavors we taste but to do so I

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:52,500
can have to tell some stories because I

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:01:01,079
don't know of the many plant breeders no

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:01,079
one higher how many people use cannabis

12
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:12,949
okay so this isn't going to be like deep

13
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,379
into plant breeding and informatics if

14
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,109
we want to do that I'll bring it Briony

15
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:20,179
up afterwards if we can we could explore

16
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,069
some of those topics but this is more

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,370
just kind of an overview of where the

18
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:30,709
industry is going and how innovation is

19
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:35,810
one good be a key segment and growth you

20
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:38,839
know previous too busy meant used to go

21
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,450
to him pecans and in CIA and all this

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,259
replaces work the biggest innovation

23
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,070
from the standpoint of the conference

24
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:51,439
goer was a new trimmer or you know some

25
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:54,199
extraction system that they hijacked a

26
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,890
process that was already fine-tuned and

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,270
Barban applied it to cannabis so I guess

28
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,799
my point is it was a whole lot of

29
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:05,949
innovation one would fancy LED nights

30
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,439
grouse changers all stuff that

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,900
agriculture and the $1 a pound or

32
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,870
conventional basil could support right

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,810
you can't can't spend the 20 million

34
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,640
capex and a range of greenhouses if you

35
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,120
don't plan to make it 20 million dollars

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:26,238
in the first few years and that's worth

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,659
standing in the cell looking down at the

38
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,789
marketplace you know we have to think

39
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:36,789
you know what's what is the largest

40
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:36,789
segment and in the market for

41
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,260
what's kind of a story and then in the

42
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,819
biggest area that were actually

43
00:02:52,259 --> 00:03:00,239
innovation in this thing's was it isn't

44
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:02,310
any technologies per se it's a different

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,629
order and for us to understand that area

46
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:11,280
think about the cultural perspective on

47
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:14,159
the market and how its permeated through

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,919
almost every sector and that that's a

49
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,039
cultural perspective you know I used to

50
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,689
play Monopoly in college on Fridays

51
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:24,389
before that I played at home with my

52
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:25,949
brothers my family but when I went to

53
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,189
Rose Hulman for the first time where I

54
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,899
got my undergraduate cynical engineering

55
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:35,098
the first Friday of I cannot

56
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,260
all the deities landed in and I did not

57
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:42,328
hit it and they're like oh that's going

58
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:43,828
in the auction house the next person's

59
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,230
turn and then item element you read the

60
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:51,420
directions you're here to be an engineer

61
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:54,090
you don't read the directions so those

62
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,429
fools are talked to me by my family or

63
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,829
by my culture and it's an example of

64
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,780
where somebody had taken something it

65
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,090
was more complex and kind of

66
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,419
oversimplified it and made it less fun

67
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,098
and that's where that's what the

68
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,530
cannabis industry has done in a lot of

69
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:14,280
ways I'm not cooking at anyone but the

70
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,350
notion of piratey AC is better the

71
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,478
notion of holding your head longer

72
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,879
you'll get higher all of these things

73
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:26,159
those are all cultural impacts and I'd

74
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,199
like to think that that's not the best

75
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,259
way to look at things especially if

76
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,478
they're not done daily users the biggest

77
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,030
market segment because those people

78
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:40,038
aren't going to want to feel weird so

79
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,038
nothing to paranoia any they're not

80
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:48,099
and that's just not the culture you

81
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,409
definitely don't like a mother of two in

82
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,300
a soccer being worrying about other

83
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,970
mothers judging her for being high that

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,650
moment if you would you innovate a

85
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,900
little bit you can remove those feelings

86
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:00,879
you need to make this a lifestyle drug

87
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:03,310
which is essentially where it's going

88
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,069
I'm not sure that cannabis is a plant

89
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,560
and cure anything but it definitely can

90
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,480
be applied as a lifestyle drive which is

91
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,839
a huge segmented farmer

92
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:18,490
whether it's anxiety its adult use or

93
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,709
benefit it doesn't matter

94
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,449
they're both therapeutic so we have we

95
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:24,759
have to think about this in the grander

96
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:27,699
scheme and step back and a lot of you

97
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,129
might realize that alcohol was like one

98
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,050
of the best Feeny killers on the planet

99
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:35,050
we've used it for years to treat the

100
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:39,699
pain and it's just a bottle that you buy

101
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:43,210
at the store oh another cultural impact

102
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:46,418
is the indica sativa notion took it

103
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:49,459
based on that perspective the biggest

104
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:52,250
innovation cannabis in 20 years to the

105
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:55,399
THC concentration right there's been

106
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:59,269
this linear growth every year it gets

107
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,888
stronger and whether it's correlated or

108
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:04,579
not correlated I like to look at the

109
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:09,019
literature and in 1996 the group did a

110
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:10,419
study looking at cannabis use and we'll

111
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:16,509
get to the definition can

112
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:19,360
and at Hearst events in 1996 about 20%

113
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:23,439
of cannabis users experienced adverse

114
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:27,100
events same study was done eight years

115
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,620
later than six years later with in 10m

116
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,680
study study

117
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,090
40% of users experience adverse events

118
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,079
so if you fast forward to the future and

119
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:41,229
today you know a lot of people are gonna

120
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,789
a banana this event you know doing a dad

121
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,100
and getting the panic attack it's an

122
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,689
adverse event had the car provocations

123
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,330
of some adverse event you're essentially

124
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,399
overdosing of a compound and the word

125
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:56,740
more studies are coming out supporting

126
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:59,589
the notion that high THC and high CBD a

127
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,750
lovely isn't as beneficial as the two

128
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:03,759
together right it's a lot like there's

129
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:11,620
only see commercials where the cop

130
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:15,759
crashing offices and you know they're

131
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,600
better together or saying my wife are

132
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,170
going to say the chocolates by itself

133
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,270
the point is there isn't a lot of

134
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:28,660
diversity of market placing how do we

135
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:32,599
bridge that gap technological innovation

136
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,400
in the space didn't exist really

137
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,439
we need to change that I feel like this

138
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,199
could be this could be the conference

139
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,360
where it becomes more technology focused

140
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,759
it's not just a new trailer or extractor

141
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,410
as I mentioned before that's was an

142
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,279
innovations event of the industries

143
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:52,020
brought here it could be new things it

144
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,479
could be novel plant types could be

145
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,579
resistance to pests and disease and all

146
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:03,720
of those things that we all are happy to

147
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:05,370
working on so cannabis what is it right

148
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,820
you go to the doctor they write your

149
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:15,000
description for poppy poppy maybe Cody

150
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,969
first off the morphine depending it is a

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,639
clean for anti-cancer therapy many

152
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,190
compounds one flavor tree and cannabis

153
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,870
today's medical program is there's a

154
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:29,310
recommendation for cannabis what's it

155
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,500
what are you using it you know what

156
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,870
chemicals are acting on your element or

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:39,538
your system and a lot of times we don't

158
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:41,870
know more as this generic indica versus

159
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:41,870
even

160
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,649
two dragons I dated but this is Miss

161
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:52,129
nomer that cannabis is just that thing

162
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:56,129
and there's a huge disconnect between

163
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:58,710
anecdotal reports of whether it's so it

164
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:01,970
helped taking my painting or you know

165
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:04,370
the music oh man there isn't

166
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,379
corroboration on the research side and

167
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,360
we want to know why that is right and it

168
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,610
could be because the markets homogenous

169
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,039
you know but only high THC there's only

170
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,500
teaching night only offers THC in a lot

171
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,809
of levels right now so so the research

172
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,250
is impacted by the marketplace and the

173
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,649
cultures because the culture says hi

174
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,259
titi ta titi ta titi and that has been

175
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:28,079
eccentric focus whereas all of us in our

176
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,659
day is CBD seems it is this booming

177
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,200
market of everybody wanting to buy it

178
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:38,850
off Amazon something you know find that

179
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,400
cure but happens at data the way that

180
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,360
regulators look at this is very Tec

181
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,009
sensor we kind of see some of the

182
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,850
universal sorry these are symbols for

183
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:54,710
cannabis and five out of seven half of

184
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:58,278
THC right on the moto and you know

185
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:01,320
Oregon with their oversupply of 1.3

186
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:04,289
they were very smart they trademark

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,778
their pox on both of these that can make

188
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:09,389
the money back licensing that simple out

189
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:12,000
to other jurisdictions but they they

190
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:14,370
have the commands like we're selecting

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,039
law that's pretty cool but it's the one

192
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,409
without THC in the top level very

193
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,629
forward-looking and if you have a

194
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:23,639
product that doesn't have THC in it but

195
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:27,450
is a cannabis product and it has to have

196
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:31,639
the THC logo on it I mean that doesn't

197
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:34,860
even match FDA would like that very much

198
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:36,778
anyway this whole definition of cannabis

199
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,539
and we need to be careful with that

200
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:41,309
because indica and sativa is a cultural

201
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,829
concept it's not really a constant

202
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:49,919
rooted in anything other than our own

203
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:52,980
culture and before I get into the meat I

204
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,679
was like remind everyone that in the

205
00:10:52,980 --> 00:11:00,570
past it was closets

206
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:02,699
backdoor deals zero regulation today or

207
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,560
somewhere in the middle in the future

208
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:10,440
it's going to be regulated

209
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:13,699
whether it's FDA whether it's us the BCC

210
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,990
whoever someone gets regulated and

211
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,940
that's all about public safety

212
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,159
it isn't to kill the culture it is it to

213
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,690
stop the movement

214
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,208
but it's to make sure that people are

215
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,399
putting adult when it's Nathan's which

216
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:27,049
happened recently versus some season

217
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,879
attendance ever being spiked with

218
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:31,370
synthetic cannabinoids

219
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,100
it's the guaranteed public safety

220
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,720
because at the end of the day someone is

221
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,319
gonna have to pick up the Medicare bill

222
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,449
for kids 18 to 25 doing dad it's their

223
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:43,729
whole life and causing some sort of

224
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:46,338
brain harm by overdose and the THC

225
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,629
console internet not saying that that's

226
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,000
going to happen that's certainly a

227
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,250
possibility right and if all you have to

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,230
do is clue administer a little CBD to

229
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,409
mitigate those harms why wouldn't you do

230
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,480
it

231
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:58,068
and you still get all of the benefits

232
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,289
and all of the happiness and all up to

233
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:02,539
high you just have a safety net there to

234
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:04,818
protect your brain which is probably the

235
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:08,500
most that I think will work and you have

236
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:08,500
a much routine

237
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:22,239
so and I just like to tell a little

238
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,720
story about a person who came to us back

239
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,039
in 2011 in 2010 and she was looking for

240
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,660
something to get off effexor and like

241
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,870
zoloft and paxil she bounced around

242
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:37,568
between his anxiety medicines and

243
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:39,370
essentially she was super stoked on

244
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:41,049
cannabis became legal and she was like

245
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,328
oh my god she's an alternative to a

246
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,318
pharmaceutical so she goes into position

247
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:46,719
in the position right to her

248
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:52,000
recommendation and the recommendation is

249
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:56,079
for cannabis and she says well just

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,870
don't smoking because smoking isn't that

251
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:11,039
bad so she doesn't a dispensary she said

252
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:13,568
[ __ ] candies chocolates just you know

253
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,730
no Stevie dependance back there is the

254
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:19,599
recipe right and she was painting on the

255
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:24,339
walls with mustard calling me and saying

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:28,269
this is crazy and just chill out and

257
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:30,370
take it out so she goes back to the

258
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,049
dispensary because you know with you

259
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,830
know we're all like chalk flowers you

260
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:35,349
know

261
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,389
the animals would label all out all

262
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,240
their still not leave all that weight

263
00:13:37,389 --> 00:14:10,450
percent definitely telling you need to

264
00:13:40,240 --> 00:14:13,089
have a okay that's cool so she tries it

265
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,980
indica it's the same thing just

266
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,410
basically anxiety anxiousness

267
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,209
Bakula and the dominant turkey in the

268
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:21,730
marketplace and them going kind of fast

269
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:24,278
here to get to the part where it's cool

270
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,200
innovative but back then in 2011

271
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:28,659
three-quarters of marketers piercing

272
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,079
dominant on the type one side of

273
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:35,588
California a lot of innovations happen

274
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:39,069
between now and in an hour a lot more

275
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:41,529
chemical diversity SC labs tested as the

276
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,570
best and state see the most improved

277
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:46,019
tests but it was pretty hard to miss

278
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,440
then and

279
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,409
the nature article from January about

280
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,800
98% of the products grown in Washington

281
00:14:52,409 --> 00:15:00,929
State were high TDC at 98% TVC were

282
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,028
power there's so many different people

283
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:05,129
likes right I mean there's there's a

284
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,350
hundred and seventy different salad

285
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,950
dressings

286
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,300
there's only THC right like how do you

287
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:16,528
have you hit all of those different

288
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:20,729
people types right in in flavor and

289
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:22,320
fragrance different panels are decided

290
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,690
by how they taste

291
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,170
not biases blind study we look at

292
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,779
everyone

293
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:29,458
some people have mutations and the taste

294
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:31,409
buds that don't allow them to taste

295
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,509
certain flavors and that's a huge

296
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:36,299
segment of the population so when you're

297
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:37,588
making products for the masses you have

298
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:40,169
to look at all these different market

299
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:43,230
segments and create flavors and effects

300
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:47,069
and things that are targeted and not

301
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:49,459
just oh we're gonna bang this out I take

302
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,660
see make money because that's gonna

303
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,729
raise his bottom it's going to come to

304
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,309
an end at some point but if you look at

305
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,470
the toolbox for NIDA and again this

306
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:00,659
marketplace is pretty limited

307
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,440
you know the TVC was different dominant

308
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,980
beings and for CPD there's only pretty

309
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,050
much one

310
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,659
chirping that's embarrassing there are

311
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:12,779
some exceptions on the marketplace for

312
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:17,279
the most part it's a homogeneous product

313
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:20,309
offering so Smith is just she didn't

314
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,779
like it she gave up on cannabis she said

315
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:30,359
through coos that was all good until was

316
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:33,179
pretty guy on TV you know even my dad

317
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:42,960
called psychology to sell eternal life

318
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:46,069
it's cool now Sunday said so got calls

319
00:16:42,960 --> 00:17:17,910
from their parents and school state

320
00:16:46,070 --> 00:17:24,120
support everybody it was only partly yes

321
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:26,069
and like buzz killer not buzz given when

322
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,019
unit to nursing that CVD is just like

323
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:30,859
the deadly combination for kill your

324
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:33,269
medicine make you depressed I think but

325
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:34,769
that was her experience - she didn't

326
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:37,200
like the end of the cloud all day she

327
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:41,160
actually preferred the pharmaceutical

328
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,559
solution for a problem which is sad

329
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,000
because you know anytime they can't help

330
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,409
someone you always feel like you got

331
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,450
something on the table and you need to

332
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,690
need to go back through time orders but

333
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,970
during this time some clients of ours

334
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,769
were working towards something but for

335
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,650
me to explain that something I have to

336
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,839
actually explain the way to visualize

337
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,500
that something you know I saw a hat

338
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:11,069
today they said chemicals kill cannabis

339
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:15,480
heels and I was like a machine gun blast

340
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:17,129
in my own studio but to be able to see

341
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,710
all these chemicals whether it's the 17

342
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,020
tear beings or you know 13 Kennedy minds

343
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,450
that this final tax report outlines

344
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,220
would we had to do something because

345
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,009
when you got a test report from a

346
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,809
laboratory that was essentially a bunch

347
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:34,500
of lines in black and white with the

348
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:36,899
numbers and letters like loq and you

349
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,309
know whatever to spend three people they

350
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,620
didn't really get anything glean

351
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:42,720
anything from it and the market then

352
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:46,079
would say hey it's the strongest was the

353
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,319
highest THC let me buy that and really

354
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:52,269
the same thing

355
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:55,059
I'm a speciality yes specifically for a

356
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:57,400
way to visualize the test results that

357
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:58,869
could be easy and intuitive and we

358
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,490
worked on this for her

359
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:03,369
we color could omit the terpenes

360
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,910
intuitively so that you know by my name

361
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:08,859
is yellow

362
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:11,400
my name is green and basically the warm

363
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:15,309
tones on the terpene profile they

364
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,259
instigated a a sativa bike terpene kind

365
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:19,309
right so if you just make your eyes

366
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:22,009
terpenes one of those lively

367
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,200
whatever you can totally feel the effect

368
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:27,379
of them if you have a consultation high

369
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,230
enough typically in high THC cannabis

370
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,540
the THC pharmacology overwhelms the

371
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:36,529
terpene pulmonology so you get kind of

372
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:41,720
this justify but as you start adding CBD

373
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:44,139
to the mix the terpene entourage gets

374
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,259
shuffled out and rises to the top

375
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:49,850
this particular example is classic first

376
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,589
like I said I think the laser reflects

377
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:56,539
off with the thing there's this

378
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:58,099
pointless but the way of platelet aroma

379
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,019
there that's activated the terpene

380
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:02,959
profile over the purple bar just weird

381
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:04,309
nursing and blues that carefully and

382
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,720
then the green is piney

383
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:10,759
this is indicative of any Kurt so

384
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,309
purpose is a category that we defined my

385
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:16,160
chemistry there into the name game so if

386
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:18,679
you have kins GDP or per protocol or

387
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,070
classic verbs or even blue dream they

388
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,529
follow this kind of cassette of terpenes

389
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:28,069
that you know people are

390
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:31,339
now having said that we can continue our

391
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:33,679
journey with Samantha where you looking

392
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:37,039
at this is OG legend it's a pretty

393
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:40,310
pretty indicative no cheese hybrid OG

394
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,309
classic European classic publication my

395
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:47,000
mini dominant really great though Geno's

396
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:49,519
a pops in their face explodes this is a

397
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,759
type 1 &amp; 2 look at the black circle

398
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:57,379
looks like a doughnut black is THC great

399
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:59,329
as the CPG this is mostly THC then it

400
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:07,490
gets her frankenstein and sag thanks

401
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:10,009
right well if you're in a greenhouse one

402
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,220
you're gonna get that adverse obscenity

403
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:15,309
so yeah I was working for me just as

404
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,110
much as I was working for Samantha here

405
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:26,648
Ronnie Lee is probably sick

406
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:26,648
because that room yeah volcano man

407
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,558
and they showed that you know the

408
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:34,099
delivery of th season one of those is

409
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:39,259
tired of smoking was recently so it

410
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:41,240
explains a lot but then you add all of

411
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:42,109
the CBD in which this is a breathing

412
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,109
technique right

413
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:48,528
most of the cannabis that breeds type 2

414
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:52,699
and the industry has a ratio of THC CBD

415
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:55,388
of one to two there are reasons for this

416
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,069
is hard to find a couple that

417
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:59,000
correlation but here we have greater

418
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:01,939
than one

419
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,298
THC the CBD which allows the TV

420
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,220
overwhelm the CBD contribution learn if

421
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:11,690
you're familiar but if you would this is

422
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:14,750
my hand gesture road we call blood serum

423
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,740
levels so THC you smoke it's up and

424
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,849
you're down fast

425
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:23,808
as you add CBD that mellows the rise and

426
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:25,879
prolongs the effect so if you if you're

427
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:28,759
consuming a type of cannabis as a long

428
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,350
no two parts to you see the one part C

429
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,269
to be your high while actually lasts

430
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,269
longer

431
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:38,079
TAC alone because of the pharmacology of

432
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:42,160
the CVD and the body but this was still

433
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:45,009
vote too edgy for analogy analogy the

434
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,140
states is indistinguishable from the

435
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:49,450
type one but it's a type two which

436
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,040
that's not all in the market that's a

437
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,750
smell something good and that's a fire

438
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,529
has energy and then for something to go

439
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,930
it's only 14% to you you see in 8% APA

440
00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:00,430
that I was like 14 percent but then even

441
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,170
you consume it again it's a really

442
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,870
enjoyable experience you still really

443
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:08,650
get all of the relief and it's like

444
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:10,449
getting saintly stones but this was a

445
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:14,320
good enough for her this is actually my

446
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:18,640
favorite world but when we added more

447
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:20,609
CBD essentially became character

448
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,150
Samantha in the trick with this

449
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:26,139
retirement reading is keeping the flavor

450
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,540
constant across all these different

451
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,080
category profiles but more importantly

452
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,808
how do you develop a parental set of

453
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,449
line

454
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:37,369
that can breed true so that out of

455
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,499
thousand seeds they all have this

456
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:42,319
chemical profile that is predictive of

457
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:44,690
not only the terpene concentration of

458
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,548
flavor and aroma but also predicted

459
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,590
above the cannabinoid ratio and

460
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:53,230
concentrations and that's a little bit

461
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:59,720
more trendy right then with any plant or

462
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:01,749
human must isolate one trait at a time

463
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,278
it's must it's very similar to

464
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:06,319
conducting an experiment if you're

465
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:08,269
growing in your grow room and you change

466
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,490
the humidity the temperature and your

467
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:12,829
nutrients how do you know what affected

468
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,690
the plant you changed your outcome so

469
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:20,118
the same thing goes for greeting and

470
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:21,590
Ryan lead actually I'd like to bring him

471
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:24,368
up after my talk because he's probably

472
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:26,418
the most knowledgeable as it pertains to

473
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:29,058
candidates in Kennedy's breeding

474
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:31,309
properly in the world and he didn't

475
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:33,048
describe all of the ins and outs of

476
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:34,038
whether it's a singular or a single

477
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:36,429
nuclear treaty

478
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:40,038
you know the informatics behind that

479
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:41,960
what we're good at is supplying the

480
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,888
infrastructure to create these novel

481
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,889
products and

482
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,190
the crux of it is how do we go from

483
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,110
where we are today at this industry

484
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,039
about like there's a lot of noise out

485
00:24:53,109 --> 00:25:00,189
there and there's no talk of innovation

486
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:02,379
is a you know there's a lot of music a

487
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,600
lot of eating smoking a lot of drinking

488
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,100
but not a lot of people talk about where

489
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:07,539
we're gonna go next year okay

490
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:10,269
how we gonna protect our marketing is

491
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:12,730
moving forward look you know everyone

492
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:14,470
says I'm great big shining right now

493
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,190
right cheese cakes and pork chops

494
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,190
everywhere

495
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:26,029
so Tyson lay the trait create current

496
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:30,150
aligned that takes time

497
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:33,149
one of our pet projects are color traits

498
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:35,400
obviously and what's nice is if you

499
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:38,160
particularly a really great parental

500
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,990
it's all for pulling it hybridize it

501
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,509
with an olive green and then you

502
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,069
germinate that that class you'd like

503
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:45,569
this nice and mix but then when you

504
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:48,269
depth to that class

505
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:50,069
the purple trade balances between every

506
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,750
part of the plant if you have a hundred

507
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:53,639
plants lined up and around you're

508
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,980
walking down you can see the purple tree

509
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,290
on the top side of the leaf only on the

510
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,539
bottom civilities only on the pistil

511
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:01,980
whole may be turned pink or the flowers

512
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,690
are four prominent leaves are green and

513
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,160
the leaves of purple flowers are green

514
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,980
and it's really neat the way the

515
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,140
training bouncing all around right well

516
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,299
if you want that trait to come back you

517
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,370
have to pick the plants where you want

518
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:16,769
the trait to be then you have to sell

519
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:17,609
them and walk that trade in one piece at

520
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:20,819
a time right

521
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:22,649
many people use males and females to

522
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:25,169
breathe and it's difficult to get

523
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,330
segregation that way right you can talk

524
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:31,259
to us later but it's almost

525
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:33,019
counterintuitive I'm not sure any plant

526
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,490
breeding projects in the world that's

527
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:38,639
still go about it that way instead they

528
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,019
use ethylene blockers to create

529
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,240
segregation so you have clear

530
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:45,480
populations you can isolate those traits

531
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,058
and in the future obviously we'll do a

532
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,970
haploid lines and thing

533
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:51,470
creating new juicers which then you can

534
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:53,509
pass all those traits of a really nice

535
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,919
and smoothly but I just want to show you

536
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:57,589
some of the innovations that have

537
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,230
happened in past few years so you can

538
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:02,808
kind of see what it what the trajectory

539
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:07,878
of technology in the plant space looks

540
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:10,038
like as shown these are three OGIS with

541
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:13,038
different animal cannabinoid

542
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:15,019
concentrations staying you know there's

543
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,259
virtually indistinguishable between each

544
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:21,378
other so to be able to conduct patient

545
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:25,639
panels or research with these is very

546
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:28,219
very awesome because it's almost like

547
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:33,740
having that that that cannabinoid less

548
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:37,100
control and GW patented but another

549
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,720
series of plans from and that this

550
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:42,079
article is our prisoners in with dr.

551
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,329
Ethan Rousseau and Kevin cemented called

552
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,999
pharmacological foundations of cannabis

553
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:50,329
kilobars has published this year

554
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:53,808
here are three lines with st. earthy

555
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:56,359
profile the same flavors and aroma seen

556
00:27:53,808 --> 00:28:00,378
by the structure the one on your far

557
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:02,148
left is one to one TCB in THC one of the

558
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:04,638
middle is approximately one to one THC

559
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:06,769
and CBD then the one on the right is one

560
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:09,829
to one CBBC

561
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:13,039
yeah so this is where we're introducing

562
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:16,159
the propyl Zen grab constant chemical

563
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,299
the flavor aroma so when people try

564
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,019
these different things that get

565
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:23,029
pronounced different experiences that's

566
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:25,970
highlighted by the can enjoyed

567
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:26,720
pharmacology and this is where you start

568
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,670
looking at these different market

569
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,360
segments as well look at the people who

570
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:34,519
want to get really Skeletor ji people

571
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:38,928
we're not soccer moms what they like the

572
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:42,109
CBD CBD v-line guava jam is essentially

573
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:45,019
this this cultivar it's at one that one

574
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:47,539
cup CPD contest last year and it gives

575
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:49,700
you an experience somewhere between

576
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:51,619
nicotine and caffeine without the

577
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,590
jitters it's completely different than

578
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:56,750
THC but it's a pronounced effect

579
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:59,220
pronounced mood enhancement and these

580
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,079
subtle effects in here

581
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,819
it's are exactly what the masses are

582
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,699
looking for and this is the type of

583
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:07,798
technology to make you tasty and

584
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,929
flavorful and to get into programs you

585
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:12,889
can try it both in their minds on

586
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:16,350
cannabis even more than they already are

587
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:19,470
some other innovation it's here this is

588
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:22,589
showing how you breathe TV out of the

589
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:25,079
line using propyl CBD on the left is a

590
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:27,178
one-to-one CVD b2c videos you move

591
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,428
across you see the gold and the doughnut

592
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:33,030
getting larger and larger and that means

593
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:34,860
@c v dve we're breeding out the THC in

594
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:37,379
replacing with Stevi division the

595
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:41,609
planting of far right has less than 0.1%

596
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,500
ta DCA so it's obviously the attempt but

597
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:47,399
it's still producing 10 to 12 percent

598
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,230
panda noise and all of them are turfed

599
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:53,429
out depending on which which plants are

600
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:56,400
looking at again those plants we have

601
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:58,980
this TC monitor and the universal symbol

602
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,400
which makes people think that there's th

603
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:08,490
CNN but like less than 0.1% is not much

604
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:11,700
time piny is a series also in the

605
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:14,400
foundations paper on the left is mostly

606
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,620
THC on the right as most of the CBD in

607
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,929
the Middle's of one to one these plants

608
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:20,909
have turfed out there's plants in this

609
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:22,950
family one of the parentals produces

610
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,140
four and a half percent triangle mode

611
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:28,890
which is crazy

612
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,360
my name is pretty harsh though you know

613
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:39,240
when you start when you start producing

614
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:46,669
flowers consumption you I can smell how

615
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,670
many do we smell seem unique really

616
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:53,640
that's like I remember walking at my

617
00:30:51,720 --> 00:31:05,670
friend's basement like it smells like

618
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:07,290
dog again yeah so so this pie eating

619
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,490
cult apart though it's very interesting

620
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:10,379
if you put enough in your scene or

621
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,839
carefully or lining a minute it's

622
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:16,679
smooths out the finding a lot so it's

623
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:19,500
more palatable but endurance runners

624
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,930
like there's a group of about ten altar

625
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,900
runners and

626
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:27,470
from that just love crying anymore the

627
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:30,200
one it gives them enough of a pain

628
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:34,160
reduction that they can do their 50 or

629
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,559
100 mile ride which is insane but also

630
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:40,730
the time that the painting makes them

631
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,389
aware of the track and not excited to

632
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,390
jump off a cliff

633
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,079
yeah and if you don't know already

634
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:50,450
cannabis is considered a

635
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:53,000
performance-enhancing drug for ultra

636
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,569
runners and long distance athletes so

637
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,740
it's banned because of that reason

638
00:31:55,569 --> 00:32:00,439
because it helps you turn your mind off

639
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:05,410
and you know your mind controls that

640
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:08,570
they think so that's a factor here to

641
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:12,140
here is not some really tasty CVG lines

642
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:16,189
on the left you have about 7% CVG and

643
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:19,070
20% THC these all smell like delicious

644
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,650
pineapple and I believe the one on the

645
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:24,250
left is actually a cultivar called the

646
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:28,070
happy pineapple that molecular farms

647
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:30,140
cruises and then as you see the light

648
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:32,029
gray and the donut getting larger and

649
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,490
larger you can see again breeding out

650
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:37,069
the THC and the placing that with CBT

651
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:40,519
and keeping a flavor which is supposed

652
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:42,349
to mean I mean and very carefully pretty

653
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,779
consistent so they all smell how does my

654
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:47,029
sweet listening finding in flavors but

655
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:49,069
that very different cannabinoid

656
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:52,190
concentrations which results in very

657
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:55,029
different effects and I can tell you

658
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:58,160
that the CPG also does what you need

659
00:32:55,029 --> 00:33:00,829
kind of does where it mitigates a lot of

660
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,720
the adverse events of THC it it cools it

661
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:06,259
down a little bit so you don't get that

662
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:12,200
you know panic attack or worried about

663
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:14,720
something said to model 10 years ago and

664
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,910
then the CPG and CBD which we've done

665
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,500
pretty much the same thing with and you

666
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:23,690
can see here everything extra data here

667
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:25,519
so again 20 minutes okay perfect got a

668
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,769
ton of time for questions so the whole

669
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,889
premise of those counters

670
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:32,079
educate each caught up on innovations

671
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:34,480
happen chemically in the cannabis plant

672
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,428
world and then open the floor to

673
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,890
questions I think my good friend Ryan II

674
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:40,179
up here to help me answer this he's way

675
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,730
smarter than me at that stuff

676
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:48,850
and that's it so do you leverage people

677
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:50,440
are smart so again that's like to remind

678
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:53,230
everyone that in the past we had no

679
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,960
regulations and in the future it's gonna

680
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:57,640
be heavily regulated period we're

681
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,220
somewhere in the middle and what may

682
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,100
throw our technology company right so we

683
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:06,269
want to bridge the gap between the two

684
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:08,648
and you know it's important because

685
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:11,559
technology is not just about science and

686
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:14,618
data and numbers it's about people and

687
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:18,128
stories and the general goal has always

688
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:20,619
been to find the problem and then create

689
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:22,179
the solution and those solutions have

690
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:25,409
helped people they just can't be

691
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:27,820
something that's a good idea that's

692
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:30,190
turned into a product and something it's

693
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,109
like that's not no successful products

694
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,300
are created a successful products are

695
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:35,309
created by saying look at all the people

696
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,039
that don't like

697
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:40,049
how do you make that crates of the trade

698
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:41,550
like another how do we create something

699
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:44,370
tastes better how do we create something

700
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:47,159
that smelled a mold and mildew resistant

701
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:50,730
and all those great things which this

702
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:54,750
plant is so plastic and dynamic you know

703
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:57,110
it's a corn and peanuts and dogs you

704
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,340
could just push it one way or the other

705
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,320
you know before you gotta get into Iowa

706
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,809
plan it's a plan

707
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,050
they're crazy different that they don't

708
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:09,329
give us a quit and then creating those

709
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,400
genetics to be stable in multiple

710
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:13,259
environments and if it's an asexual

711
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,559
propagated clone I'm kind of going off

712
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,340
from attention it could vary a lot from

713
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:22,590
whether it's out your greenhouse endure

714
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,910
the the chemo type of that genotype will

715
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:27,570
change depending on the environment

716
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:29,460
because of epigenetics now a lot of the

717
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,900
seeds that would produce that are

718
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,389
homozygous chemically and

719
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,880
morphologically they actually can endure

720
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:38,509
different environments and have more

721
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,519
stability across those environments so

722
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,470
the future is going to be you know

723
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,210
homozygous seed production today we're

724
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:46,969
stuck in this

725
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:49,490
sexual clonal production world and I

726
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:53,868
just love to see where it goes and I

727
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:55,309
hope you would enjoy the talk but this

728
00:35:53,869 --> 00:36:00,650
day to do this plant can't read

729
00:35:55,309 --> 00:36:04,519
everything right there baby Paul Parker

730
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:06,260
and ACA are ICRS dr. Dee's original

731
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:09,050
everybody says and applications for this

732
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,960
plant February minor minded of the

733
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:14,060
largest pharmaceutical cannabis company

734
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,650
in the world as GW Pharma and they still

735
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:18,679
get all of their cannabinoids from

736
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,650
plants so innovations in the plant space

737
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:26,329
will directly impact Pharma and vice

738
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:28,940
versa I'm sure so you have any questions

739
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:31,269
or comments I'd love to answer them join

740
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,269
the talk

741
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:54,960
and here's a Mike Mike Andy works up

742
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:54,960
here

743
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:02,750
yeah okay that's questions I have a

744
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,519
quick question on the analytical testing

745
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:07,519
specifically around the ball of litter

746
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:10,699
beads mostly looking at testing of those

747
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:12,829
terpenes from the perspective of the

748
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:15,078
planets elfin breeding perspective and

749
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:16,550
than a consumer product you would think

750
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,710
that there would be some change in

751
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:20,750
makeup of those volatile terpenes and

752
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,500
through the sheer dry process judy

753
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:26,059
comments around appropriate time to

754
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,190
perform that testing from both plain

755
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:30,470
reading and then also you know the

756
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:33,800
finished product perspective is it a web

757
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:36,739
type sample that should be submitted

758
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,339
during further for you know the breeding

759
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:42,308
inflammation in the finished product for

760
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:46,219
the consumer information

761
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:48,559
well obviously want to test the product

762
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:50,588
if you have Sally left product however

763
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,790
if it were commodity and you were

764
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:54,529
pushing that what product is it fresh

765
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:56,219
goes and they would perhaps it makes

766
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:59,580
more sense is what

767
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:01,750
typically to get a Filofax report its

768
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:03,549
pre-packaging like literally moments

769
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,679
before packaging so that they can

770
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:08,230
guarantee the shelf life of that 60 days

771
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,569
to be true to the find effects if you

772
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:13,780
know did the proper packaging with seals

773
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,700
then actually the degradation occurs

774
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:19,690
faster well it's not stored properly

775
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:21,039
imperious bastard in mes turkey profile

776
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,409
changes during recruitment training

777
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,079
process if you were looking to protect

778
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:29,049
you know some makeup of that those

779
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,230
turkey knees you know as an IP video

780
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:35,320
generate in with cadet lien on the

781
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:38,650
product itself the plan you know playing

782
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,599
I guess plant I feed and packets on the

783
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:45,869
plan shouldn't be it actually tested on

784
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,869
the plan B for its curative or is there

785
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:07,960
attorney so I hey Beth hi mark

786
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,200
they're next on The Price is Right and

787
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:14,320
next

788
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:17,949
right gonna bid on this chair oh my god

789
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,809
$10 1520's

790
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:22,759
so I also want to ask you a bunch of

791
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:25,549
patents but we'll talk about that later

792
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,640
I have a question about the homozygous

793
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,260
nature of these seeds and so know

794
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,759
there's an artist Natalie Jeremy Jane

795
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,760
Caro we didn't know you familiar there

796
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:39,710
Natalie Jeremy Jacobs she is an artist

797
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:42,078
if you did an experiment some years ago

798
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,240
called many trees and she took clones of

799
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,680
trees and planted them in a variety of

800
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:50,959
different locations to basically show

801
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:52,639
how it impacts how things grow can you

802
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,449
explain a little bit of the science

803
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:59,809
behind how stable steel lines can

804
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:03,618
actually produce more stability in

805
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:05,980
different environments there's a

806
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,980
question

807
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,840
well just do the killing and Conway

808
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:16,090
answer any question you want

809
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,440
and then again say that I have a parser

810
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,108
so

811
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,409
almost like honesty now Howard wire

812
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:25,690
seats were robust chemically than points

813
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:27,429
and basically like how is it that like

814
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,200
because of the variability that can

815
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:32,019
happen in different environments how is

816
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:34,629
it possible to have stable seeds that

817
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:36,699
produce more stable results in different

818
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,930
environments so you can so when we're

819
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:41,559
breeding we can only control the

820
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:43,139
genetics of the plant right and an

821
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,750
average genetic sorrow produces

822
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:46,759
environmental effect

823
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:51,800
there's across environments is something

824
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:53,300
that you're gonna have land area so but

825
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,610
you know creating homes like a seed

826
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:59,630
really allows us to have that uniformity

827
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:01,700
to start exploring an asexual

828
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:05,000
propagation in itself is stressful in

829
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:07,399
the planet and our study showed that the

830
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,679
more stress you click on that plant the

831
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,110
more it has the tendency you know people

832
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,569
say oh it lost its vigor or its genetic

833
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:17,570
drift or whatever it goes a lot of times

834
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,220
those asexually propagated clones and it

835
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,769
know stressed out whether their mothers

836
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:26,659
and their rootbound you know vetted

837
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:28,340
that's just not the most of the best way

838
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:30,500
to do that for that planet is you want

839
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,269
all those switches turned on and if you

840
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:36,050
plant is stressed out because it's been

841
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:38,869
a section of propagated to be locked

842
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,760
down whatever that has a tendency to be

843
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:42,469
more near sitting on romantic and

844
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,540
annoyed in the oil concentration goes

845
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:46,849
down and the whole thing way that we've

846
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:49,880
seen the sticks that it is a plant those

847
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:52,159
those plants in the ground during the

848
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,220
lengthening season so in the spring

849
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,319
under the sun you get to your circadian

850
00:41:55,219 --> 00:42:00,409
led them back you have another little

851
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,870
bit of growth and that can assume that a

852
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:04,759
lot of those switches out other ways are

853
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:05,880
this drifted down to the tissue culture

854
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,470
and

855
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,680
as vigorous growth back to the

856
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:14,849
vegetative stage but as for the seeds

857
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:17,219
versus clones they it's just it's so

858
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:19,469
notable the difference between how a

859
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:21,779
seed the form to clone performance from

860
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:25,619
the bigger side of the resistance to

861
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,090
pests pathogens it's quite notable and

862
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,440
we're seeing through the tissue cultures

863
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:31,769
of these companies that can live do it

864
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,840
now the testing you know we realize that

865
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:35,880
it's plants that acquiring as I close to

866
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,360
my stress disorder there's plants

867
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,950
acquire leave marks call them stress

868
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,890
events but it's also this bacteria

869
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:47,039
viruses and they grow they lived with

870
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:48,750
the plant was one of the petition

871
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,029
cultures able to do is bring it back

872
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:54,480
down to the meristem and eliminate all

873
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:57,300
those external forces on CD brought back

874
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,619
fresh plant which is really close to

875
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,110
what we had the see it's one of the

876
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,219
benefits that we have no see the

877
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,230
trade-off is at the current environment

878
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:06,419
a lot of these seeds are hybrid seeds

879
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:08,800
and they're kind of all over the place

880
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,769
phenotypically Aquila typically

881
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,720
that uniformity so well that's not the

882
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:15,159
point right you can buy 10 Z's and get

883
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,359
10 FINA well that was someone who's

884
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,099
saying naturally to me you know it's

885
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,230
it's a really important thing to have

886
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:22,529
it's me not thinking and you know

887
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,699
typically in regular agriculture that's

888
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:27,130
something that's relegated to the plant

889
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:29,259
breeders it's not you know an everyday

890
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,140
gardener thing they go they look for

891
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:34,420
plants usually in horticulture producers

892
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:35,859
produce that's all they do don't go look

893
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,539
for the variation so it's something that

894
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,480
our community is on the top too which is

895
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:42,340
great you know it's distributed platform

896
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,869
where a lot of different people are

897
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,539
looking for all the different flavors in

898
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:49,210
fact so it's you don't have one person's

899
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:53,409
perspective like yep so as a proper

900
00:43:49,210 --> 00:44:06,400
introduction to Ryan he died many years

901
00:43:53,409 --> 00:44:09,759
ago he does 11 importation into Canada

902
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,849
for seeds you you get through our

903
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,490
partnership for farm the Canada that's

904
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:16,989
really regulated system where you can't

905
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:18,639
just bring genetics into the system of

906
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:20,859
licensed growers they have to document

907
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,690
where all the receipts come from so we

908
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:27,780
sold pitch and I think some of these

909
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:27,780
into these companies any other question

910
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:35,250
everybody wants to give straight Eman

911
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:39,088
eyes I'm not sure it's a proper term for

912
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:40,858
feminazis actually diagnosis speeds by

913
00:44:39,088 --> 00:44:43,710
engine we talked about that agents money

914
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:45,869
you should probably read these words it

915
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:53,099
comes from the Greek word for mm so

916
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:55,048
there's you know so Canisius just means

917
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:57,420
that the breeding is done through two

918
00:44:55,048 --> 00:45:00,298
female plants that we use a chemical

919
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,789
manipulation to induce pollen over to us

920
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:06,119
and that we can breed you know we can

921
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:08,279
use that quality fermenting process and

922
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,869
originally the the season came on the

923
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,970
market from that fashion of some of

924
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:14,818
these other early companies the methods

925
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:16,949
that they use to generate that seed and

926
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:20,130
all these inherent problems with

927
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:22,889
intersexuality so people throwing plants

928
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,599
patent you know female plants will be

929
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:26,690
former seeds and obviously as tennis

930
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,920
cultivator for flowers that's not idea

931
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,079
so I think that really painted the

932
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,450
reputation of what we call feminized

933
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,170
seeds on the market and people you know

934
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:38,519
really wanted to stay with these regular

935
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:41,250
male-female crosses the problem is is

936
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:43,739
actually using males is pretty terrible

937
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:46,048
a to select pollen donors for cannabis

938
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:49,798
because the plants themselves don't

939
00:45:46,048 --> 00:45:51,838
express the traits of interest leaves is

940
00:45:49,798 --> 00:45:53,849
kind of rationale of grass analogy is

941
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,190
like if you're breeding humans for

942
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:58,318
breast size it's pretty easy to cheesy

943
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,088
peanuts right but how do you choose the

944
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:00,789
males how do you choose the males that

945
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:02,469
have that

946
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:05,440
four large breasts when they don't

947
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:07,569
express that straight right so when

948
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,650
we're using for jelly female crosses and

949
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:13,780
that some lurk we do to Pedro we really

950
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,880
see that there's this huge game you can

951
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:19,630
get you're doing positive selection for

952
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,970
chemistry on both parentals it just did

953
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:24,160
speeds on their breathing and it's also

954
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:25,449
beautiful in your state in these plants

955
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,219
you don't have to go through and

956
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:30,250
eliminate the males run spending

957
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:31,629
resources of time you know and a lot of

958
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,150
these companies are offering these gen

959
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:37,240
accepts tasks where you're paying so you

960
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:39,519
pay $10 to see look you pay $15 to go

961
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:41,649
and have the plants axed right and

962
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:42,969
that's just not really an efficient use

963
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:47,619
of resources so there's a lot of

964
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:50,079
benefits of using and remember that's a

965
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:52,519
trait right so if you're feminizing

966
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,110
seeds grow and you have

967
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:58,139
you wrote that and they'll pick two more

968
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:59,970
females from lazada feminize that then

969
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:03,750
you have a thousand and maybe one mill

970
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:05,699
and you pick the best one every 100,000

971
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,889
only one now so you can breathe that

972
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:12,449
trade out just the same as any trade

973
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:16,049
right how do you recommend doing that to

974
00:47:12,449 --> 00:47:19,859
get to the guy who reaches typically

975
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:22,470
what senator we're asking in editors as

976
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:29,220
the major hormone controls that

977
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:33,329
chemicals it's the same track those

978
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:35,459
gasses so if you count these inhibitors

979
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:36,420
was a silver compound and health silver

980
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,670
thiosulfate

981
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,230
you can also use colloidal silver you

982
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:43,139
spray it on your plant that blocks the

983
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:53,699
ethylene receptor and house is all about

984
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:55,289
colloidal silver there's some individual

985
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:58,619
the Internet need wouldn't drag budget

986
00:47:55,289 --> 00:48:00,750
colloidal silver people think that maybe

987
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:03,559
it does mats but if you drink too much

988
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,559
you turn blue

989
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:08,119
