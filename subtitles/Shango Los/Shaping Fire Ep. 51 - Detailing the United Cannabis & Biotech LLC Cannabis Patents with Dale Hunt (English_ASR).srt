2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:09,300
we are experiencing a clash of

3
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:11,189
civilizations right now in cannabis

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,290
generally speaking the heritage of

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,718
cannabis is sharing we've always shared

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,910
canvas flowers and seeds and insight on

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,800
how to grow at the center of cannabis

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,800
culture is the whole idea of puff puff

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,240
pass and not to Bogart the joint while

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,769
certainly there were some folks who may

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,448
not have wanted you to circulate their

12
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,788
special cut of some strain or another

13
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,500
the vast majority of time cannabis folks

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,210
shared whatever they had because we were

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,519
all sharing in the oppression of the

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,558
government through prohibition now

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,140
though the emerging licensed cannabis

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,359
market is based on ownership extravagant

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,909
packaging and intellectual property this

20
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,320
is a very significant change and I won't

21
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,689
say that the schism is within the

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,579
cannabis community I will say that it's

23
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,070
within the cannabis industry because

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,899
again generally those who are seeing the

25
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,619
green rush is a quick way to grab it all

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,120
are often Outsiders coming in or

27
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,070
longtime insiders working with newly

28
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,378
accessible outside capital investment

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,650
and we all know how corrupting sudden

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,820
access to piles of cash can be one of

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,780
the ways that companies are trying to

32
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,250
take advantage of the young

33
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,609
infrastructure of the cannabis industry

34
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,769
is by filing exceptionally broad patents

35
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:19,140
and daring for anyone to try to take

36
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,709
them on because few people have the

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,670
depth of pockets to take them on

38
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:25,199
certainly I'm making some pretty big

39
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,969
generalizations here but if you're

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,700
watching the cannabis scene evolve you

41
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,868
know that on the whole I'm right

42
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,100
certainly I know some newcomers to

43
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,259
canvas who have their heart in the right

44
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,149
place and it's also certainly true that

45
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,090
some of the heritage folks were not all

46
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,130
that kind intellectual property is legal

47
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,070
though and you either are or are not

48
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:46,228
filing for an over broad patent you do

49
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,938
not accidentally lawyer up and file a

50
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:50,280
patent that pretty much says you

51
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,618
invented an entire product category it

52
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,299
is not like accidentally bogarting the

53
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,118
joint while talking too much before

54
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,829

does it all having started as a botanist

97
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,878
and plant geneticist Dale continued his

98
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,459
study of plant biology at the cellular

99
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,978
and molecular level completing a PhD at

100
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,259
UC San Diego Dale then went on to UC

101
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,359
Berkeley for law school Dale has spoken

102
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,370
at Emerald Cup as a panel expert on

103
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,769
cannabis patents and Dale was also a

104
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,989
pretty great all-around guy his law firm

105
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,060
is called plant and planet if that tells

106
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,158
you anything today we're gonna talk in

107
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,689
detail about two of the most hotly

108
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,908
discussed cannabis patents that

109
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:49,439
presently exist and what breeders and

110
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:51,328
cannabis lovers everywhere can do to

111
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,870
help support open access to cannabis

112
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:57,209
genetics welcome to the show Dale thank

113
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,129
you I'm glad to be here so let's jump

114
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,549
right into it and and even though we've

115
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:04,978
done quite a few shows about cannabis

116
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,620
patenting at this point I think it's

117
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,169
really important to bring people up to

118
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,438
the now in the difference between plat

119
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,090
patents versus use patents because a lot

120
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,680
of people who are new to this topic of

121
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,680
cannabis patents they kind of just

122
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,209
picture them all in one big bucket but

123
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
since we're gonna be talking about both

124
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,590
plant and use patents today I think it's

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,879
good to get us right on the same page of

126
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:28,379
what the differences are

127
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,009
between those so would you start there

128
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:34,050
please yes I'd be happy to so I think

129
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:37,199
the easiest way to think about how to

130
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,100
distinguish these things is to think

131
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,159
about the fact that a plant selection a

132
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:48,210
plant variety a cultivar can be seen as

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,420
a unique thing a unique result of

134
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:54,870
creative effort by a plant breeder or it

135
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,470
can be seen as an invention that has

136
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,639
lots of different applications and

137
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,350
really that they're both true but the

138
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,439
reason I set it up that way is that a

139
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,300
plant patent is meant to cover the plant

140
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,939
as a unique thing and it protects

141
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,860
against copying it and so the the best

142
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,600
analogy that existed intellectual

143
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,639
property is to say that a plant patent

144
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,490
is a lot like a copyright on a plant

145
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,930
variety it only protects against direct

146
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,730
copying it doesn't protect against

147
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,850
similarity it doesn't protect against

148
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,129
independent derivation of something even

149
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:30,110
with the same parents it only protects

150
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:34,139
clonal copying of that exact genotype as

151
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:38,699
well as it's harvested material in

152
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:41,069
contrast a utility patent is it can

153
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,139
cover the same the same underlying plant

154
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:44,730
variety but it treats it like an

155
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,259
invention that you can use in a lot of

156
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,610
different ways and that you can

157
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,420
potentially claim in a lot of different

158
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,270
ways so what I mean by that is with a

159
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,400
utility patent one of your claims and I

160
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:58,889
should just stop and explain a patent

161
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,289
claim is like a fence around your

162
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,089
invention it's it's the definition of

163
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,300
the boundaries between what you invented

164
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:09,719
and what still is out there outside the

165
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,639
scope of your coverage and so when

166
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,290
you're doing a utility patent you can

167
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,029
claim if you can claim your invention

168
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,740
any way you want as long as you can

169
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:18,899
demonstrate to the patent examiner that

170
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,569
it is new and it's not obvious and that

171
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,039
it has utility and that it's not outside

172
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:27,329
of what's called patentable subject

173
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:30,480
matter so if I treat my plant variety as

174
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:35,839
an invention one of the claims I could

175
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:41,629
write would be the cannabis plant or

176
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,629
plant yeah okay a cannabis plant

177
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,329
TIPA fide by I'm not finding the best

178
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,519
words for right now but a cannabis plant

179
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:54,329
typifies by the seeds that are on

180
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:56,310
deposit under accession XYZ or cannabis

181
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:58,829
plants related to the seeds that are on

182
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,530
deposit and if you do it this way you do

183
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:02,849
need to make a seed deposit but then

184
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:04,439
that so that could be claimed one is

185
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,879
defining the plant based upon the

186
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,670
deposit the next claim could be

187
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,100
something like progeny of the plants of

188
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,890
claim one another claim could be an

189
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,170
extract made from the plants have

190
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,729
claimed one or claim two so an extract

191
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,520
made from that variety or from its

192
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:24,360
progeny you could have a claim to a

193
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,969
method of breeding cannabis comprising

194
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,330
having the clay at the plaintiff claim

195
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,720
one as one of the parents now what this

196
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:35,550
does is it makes it so that you can

197
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,920
protect that variety a lot more broadly

198
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,860
than just straight-up clonal copying you

199
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,750
can protect you could well you can

200
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,030
maintain exclusivity as to the right to

201
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,310
breed with that plant if you care to if

202
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:52,019
that's how you want to claim it you can

203
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:55,680
have control over the extracts who can

204
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:57,299
make extracts and and so on and again

205
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,660
it's you think about the each of these

206
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,199
claims is a fence around the property of

207
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,750
your invention and so there's nothing

208
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,370
inherently right or wrong about either

209
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,290
one of these approaches plant patents

210
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,430
are a little less expensive and faster

211
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:17,790
to grant utility patents do take a

212
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,019
longer process to persuade the examiner

213
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,670
that each one of these claims is

214
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:25,949
actually worthy of patent protection but

215
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,439
in both cases they're really going to be

216
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:32,218
focused upon the variety that the

217
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,219
breeder developed and so in both cases

218
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,960
it's I my opinion it's well within the

219
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,599
right of the breeder to protect that

220
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,900
kind of invention or that kind of

221
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,090
development right on um I actually never

222
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,250
really thought about the idea of a

223
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,290
breeder having a choice whether which

224
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,029
one they wanted to pursue I didn't

225
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:52,469
realize that there was so much overlap I

226
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,159
thought it was either clearly going to

227
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,560
be a pair

228
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,809
plant a patent or it was clearly going

229
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:01,019
to be a use patent but really there's a

230
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:04,019
lot of overlap and and and how you'd

231
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,610
file it contains a lot of strategy about

232
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,090
what you expect your challenges to look

233
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,580
like that's very true and I actually

234
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,680
wrote a blog about this topic because it

235
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,259
came up so much and I wanted people to

236
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,500
be able to understand the kind of the

237
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:21,750
analytical pathway you go down to decide

238
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,450
what kind of IP protection you need for

239
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,190
your for your plant variety the blog is

240
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,960
titled something like let's talk about

241
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,930
reproduction and how you will get paid

242
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,769
and I have all my blogs on plant law

243
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:37,799
comm but the point of that blog and the

244
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:40,230
point of the analysis is that if you are

245
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:43,740
going to protect your plants if you're

246
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,629
gonna sell clones let's say you want to

247
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,389
be able to control who is who's allowed

248
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:49,980
to make clones and if that's how you're

249
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,569
gonna make your money you need a plant

250
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,740
patent and you also need more than that

251
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,480
because you still need you need to

252
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,129
control you know you need to be careful

253
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,750
about who makes the clones and who sells

254
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:03,870
them because it's so easy to go out and

255
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,870
copy it a plant and make more clones

256
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,299
that the patent will give you the right

257
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,429
to stop vermin someone from making those

258
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,740
clones if you're willing to litigate

259
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:15,929
against them and if you even find out

260
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,620
about them but it's always best if

261
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:21,449
you're selling clones to only work with

262
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,179
someone that you really trust to make

263
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,009
the clones and to restrict what's done

264
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,889
with the clones afterwards so for

265
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:31,919
example maybe you've got a variety that

266
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:35,039
has just that just as a great flower

267
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,929
quality and you want that to be as

268
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,339
accessible to people as possible you

269
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,829
want it to be in a lot of dispensaries

270
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,810
and so you want there to be a lot of

271
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:46,170
harvested material that's available for

272
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:48,059
for commercial access but you don't

273
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:49,649
really want somebody to just grab a

274
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:51,029
little bit of your propagating material

275
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,169
and start to compete with you that's the

276
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,500
whole reason you got a patent in the

277
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:57,629
first place and so if you're selling

278
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,899
clones only so that other people can

279
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:02,340
propagate and and sell harvested

280
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,049
material that's great but you should

281
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,629
restrict even then you should restrict

282
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:11,889
what they can do with those clones

283
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:13,509
and that that that gets into some other

284
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:15,539
complicated areas that are probably

285
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,490
beyond what we should go into today but

286
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:22,059
I'm happy to explain those in more

287
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,620
detail with if anyone's interested so

288
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:24,849
okay that's one thing if you're selling

289
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,350
clones you've got to go with the plant

290
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,149
patent because that's well that's one

291
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,029
thing you can do and it's a simpler

292
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,439
option but if you're selling seeds it's

293
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,079
really important to understand that a

294
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,580
plant patent won't even protect that

295
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,590
because the plant patent only protects

296
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,259
direct clonal progeny it does not

297
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:43,000
protect seed progeny so you're really

298
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,759
your only choice if you're selling seeds

299
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,299
is a utility patent if it's a high THC

300
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:51,580
variety or if it's industrial hemp seeds

301
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:54,159
that's also something that you can

302
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,110
protect through the USDA plant variety

303
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,449
Protection Act that's called the plant

304
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,899
variety protection certificate and I'm

305
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,370
just gonna stop here to explain that the

306
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,289
rest of the world is different sometimes

307
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,149
I get I was actually challenged by

308
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:08,679
someone who said you're giving bad

309
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,329
advice you should tell everybody to seek

310
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,839
youp of type protection

311
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:18,129
well you pop is an acronym for it's a

312
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,240
for a French the French title of this

313
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:21,370
convention but it's basically the

314
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,750
English version is the International

315
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,350
Convention on protection of plant

316
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,690
varieties and it establishes plant

317
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,670
breeders rights that you can apply for

318
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:36,060
in any member of this convention and

319
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:39,699
those plant breeders rights are very

320
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,469
they cover both seeds and clones but

321
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,890
they have some exemptions that make them

322
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,529
a little bit problematic anyone can

323
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:51,069
breed with something that is covered by

324
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:55,449
a Utah you pop certificate as there's

325
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:57,910
Express breeders exemption so that if

326
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,370
you obtain you you pop rights but

327
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:02,589
someone has access that has legitimate

328
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,120
access to your plants you can't stop

329
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,470
them from using that plant to breed

330
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,669
other plants now some people may say

331
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,430
that's great that's a great result

332
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:12,699
that's great public policy it enhances

333
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:16,959
the diversity of what people have access

334
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,910
to for breeding but anyway so the rest

335
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,528
of Maat the bottom line here is the rest

336
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:22,719
of the world is different in the way

337
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:24,730
protects plant varieties the us is

338
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,519
unique in having really three different

339
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,170
approaches the USDA PvP approach which

340
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,278
is like you pub in the rest of the world

341
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:36,729
the USPTO plant patent which is like a

342
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,379
copyright and the USPTO utility patent

343
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,230
which treats the plant like any other

344
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:43,240
invention right on Wow thank you for

345
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,749
that explanation I can I can already

346
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,049
hear the breeders strategizing in their

347
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:52,808
head on the other side of the signal and

348
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:54,969
for folks who are listening because you

349
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:56,528
yourself are a breeder and you actually

350
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,249
have to think through this strategy for

351
00:13:56,528 --> 00:14:01,659
yourself stick around for the second set

352
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:05,079
of the show where we're going to be

353
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:06,549
talking with Dale in detail about about

354
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:09,789
what actions that you can take to

355
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:11,558
actually protect yourself but right now

356
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:14,828
during the first set I want it I want to

357
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:17,230
shift with you Dale because now that we

358
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:19,989
generally have an idea what the area

359
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,769
that we're talking about I would like

360
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:27,730
you to give us some good detail on the

361
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:31,209
two probably most talked about patents

362
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:35,920
that that cannabis folks especially to

363
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:39,008
heritage growers are calling over abroad

364
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,349
and and certainly these names have been

365
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:43,808
coming up a ton since the Philo's

366
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,389
debacle but you know people have been

367
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:48,698
discussing the the biotech LLC patent

368
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,250
for a few years now I give credit to

369
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:53,649
amanda chicago lewis when she wrote that

370
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,259
story in rolling stone that kind of made

371
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:58,240
it apparent to everybody what was going

372
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,399
on and kind of brought it up to the

373
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,750
public consciousness but people talk

374
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,089
about that and you know how people talk

375
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,399
on the internet my god all these people

376
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,769
who have either wrong information or

377
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,750
their or an incomplete set of

378
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:14,019
information but everybody's got an

379
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,740
opinion right and so I figure as both a

380
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:20,078
plant scientist and a patent attorney

381
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,970
you are going to be able to offer us you

382
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,409
know some rare insight into this so

383
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,678
let's the first of the two I want to

384
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:28,269
talk about is the biotech LLC patents so

385
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:31,839
if you would like take us from square

386
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:33,759
one explain what the the patent is

387
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,230
kind of the two sides of the debate and

388
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,370
and share your thoughts if you would

389
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,629
sure

390
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:42,639
yeah well this patent is it's definitely

391
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,080
a utility patent and it's it's there's

392
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,409
actually a family of patents that have

393
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,000
similar strategies to cover related

394
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:52,269
subject matter so I'll just talk about

395
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,049
the the one that gets talked about the

396
00:15:52,269 --> 00:16:01,899
most which is let's see I'll get you the

397
00:15:56,049 --> 00:16:05,469
number of the patent it's vertical its

398
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:08,799
patent number nine three seven zero one

399
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:11,019
six four and anyone who wants to follow

400
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,939
along at home can actually google that

401
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:14,439
and they'll probably be able to get a

402
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,710
copy of the patent right in front of

403
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,450
them so it's nine three seven oh one six

404
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,030
four actually there are a few of them

405
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,610
that are like this but this is a good

406
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:27,069
one to talk about so you know how I

407
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,070
talked about the fact that when you have

408
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,900
a utility patent you can claim it any

409
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,270
way you can claim your invention any way

410
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:37,840
you want as long as you can persuade the

411
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:40,529
examiner that the that what you've

412
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,300
claimed is new and not obvious and

413
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:46,959
adequately described and falls within

414
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:48,849
allowable subject matter and I should

415
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,620
explain what that means the allowable

416
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,950
subject matter thing is comes from

417
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:57,100
section 101 of the patent statute and it

418
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,440
just says that well the court

419
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,389
interpretation of section 101 is that

420
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,430
there are certain things that are just

421
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:07,660
not patentable including laws of nature

422
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:09,220
and products of nature and so we can get

423
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,250
into more detail about that when we talk

424
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,470
about the the next patent but in this

425
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,829
case this the the kinds of claims in

426
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,838
this patent are not not restricted by

427
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,059
section 101 and so the patent examiner

428
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:25,480
would look at the claim and ask is this

429
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:27,490
new is this obvious and has it been

430
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,349
adequately described and the patent

431
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:34,599
examiner clearly was reached the answer

432
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:37,089
to a yes answer to all three of those

433
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,559
questions I'd like to walk through the

434
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:42,069
claim and then we can talk about whether

435
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,990
that yes answer was was appropriate that

436
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:48,470
sounds great okay so

437
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,539
which is typical and it's the only claim

438
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,460
we'll spend any time on because this has

439
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:55,700
a lot of claims and it would get tedious

440
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,220
but it claims a pan of a cannabis plant

441
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,450
or an asexual clone of a plant or a

442
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,370
plant part or a tissue or a cell that

443
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,460
produces a female in fluorescence so

444
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:09,949
basically it's a female cannabis plant

445
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:14,569
and it has at least three percent THC

446
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:17,960
and at least 3 percent CBD and a terpene

447
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:21,169
profile that is not mercy and dominant

448
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:26,299
and a terpene oil content greater than

449
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:28,429
1% now there's some other other language

450
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:30,409
in the claim that just talks about what

451
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:32,870
the other terpenes are that's pretty

452
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:36,590
standard list of terpenes as far as I've

453
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:38,269
been told and then it also talks about

454
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:40,970
how those terpenes are measured as

455
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:43,160
measured by gas chromatography and then

456
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,440
the last phrase is we're in a

457
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,500
representative sample of seed producing

458
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,660
said plants has been deposited under and

459
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,259
then there's a list of accession number

460
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:57,050
so they made several seed deposits as

461
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:59,299
representative samples what's important

462
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,799
about this claim is that this is what I

463
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,990
would call and what other people have

464
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,089
called it a chemo type claim it's not

465
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,500
it's not limited to any of those

466
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:08,329
particular samples that's why they

467
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,390
deposited multiple samples and said it's

468
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:14,269
just representative so this this claim

469
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,220
would cover by most people's

470
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:17,900
interpretation and I've got to stop and

471
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,240
just say I'm not from not providing any

472
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,720
legal advice to anyone this is this is

473
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,329
my educational analysis kind of of the

474
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,690
way patent law works as applied to an

475
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:32,569
exemplary claim if anyone needs legal

476
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:35,660
advice on this I get a lot lot deeper

477
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:38,808
and provide legal advice in a way that

478
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,519
is much much more detailed so no one

479
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:44,839
should rely on this as any kind of legal

480
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:48,679
advice this is educational only alright

481
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:54,379
so what I've been told by lots of people

482
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:57,919
is that this chemo type is one that has

483
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,820
been around for a long time that people

484
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,880
can point to

485
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:04,339
examples of other cannabis plants that

486
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,080
pre-existed the filing date and let's go

487
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:08,689
back and look at that filing date so we

488
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:17,839
can be clear about this the filing date

489
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:22,149
of this patent is July let's yeah sorry

490
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:26,388
it's well the yeah the filing date is

491
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:29,629
July 17th 2015 and the earliest date

492
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:32,990
that it claims back to which matters the

493
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:35,299
the the patent eligibility analysis is

494
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,798
always a function of different dates and

495
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:38,210
then was there anything before those

496
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,579
dates that was out there in the public

497
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,308
domain and was known so the earliest

498
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:49,398
date that this is entitled to under any

499
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:51,168
theory is going to be March 15th 2013 so

500
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:53,869
back to the kind of the public

501
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:55,940
discussion of this there are people lots

502
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:59,388
of people who say that this particular

503
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:02,269
chemo type pre-existed 2013 they can

504
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:04,758
point to other strains or cultivars of

505
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:09,319
cannabis that are at least 3 percent THC

506
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:11,960
at least 3 percent CBD and and then are

507
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:14,869
not mercy and dominant and that have

508
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,700
greater than 1% terpene oil now I want

509
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:19,308
to emphasize that I haven't I haven't

510
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,080
independently analyzed any cultivars and

511
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:23,928
I haven't fact checked anyone's

512
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:26,058
assertions about this so from here on

513
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,460
out this is a discussion of the way the

514
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:31,908
patent law would work if those

515
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,860
assertions were true and this does

516
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:36,799
expose one of the fundamental problems

517
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,709
with with cannabis patents any kind of

518
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:42,378
cannabis patents with any kind of breath

519
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,419
and that is that when the examiner is

520
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:46,908
looking at this claim and trying to

521
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:48,200
decide if it's new or non-obvious they

522
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:51,289
don't just put their finger in the wind

523
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,610
and and wonder they have a particular

524
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:55,158
procedure that they go through and they

525
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:59,329
do this for biotech patents medical

526
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,919
patents airplane engines electronic

527
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:03,138
devices anything at all that you that

528
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,120
you're claiming to invented what they do

529
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:07,158
is they look at the claim and then they

530
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,619
do a search involving keywords and

531
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,340
categories to try to find the closest

532
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:14,619
thing they can find to this claim

533
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:17,649
and they look in in in other industries

534
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:19,709
they will have you know at least tens of

535
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:22,538
thousands or hundreds of thousands of

536
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:26,380
moderately relevant academic papers to

537
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:27,908
look at in in the overall database of

538
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,320
what's already known what's in the

539
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:31,539
public knowledge

540
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,189
so they'll they'll do a search if it's a

541
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:35,859
biotech case they might they might

542
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,419
really have access to well they would

543
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,278
easily have access to over a hundred

544
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,370
thousand different academic papers and

545
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:44,679
probably a lot more than that as well as

546
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:46,808
they they would also search all of the

547
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,548
prior patent literature and they look

548
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:51,009
for whatever is closest to that claim

549
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:53,470
and then they use that as a basis for a

550
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:54,788
rejection of the claim and it's almost

551
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,558
always the case that a claim will be

552
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:58,179
rejected the first time around because

553
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:02,648
it's almost it's kind of the examiner's

554
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:04,720
job to explain why that well to say that

555
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:06,489
the the claim isn't allowable for these

556
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,740
reasons and then put it on the applicant

557
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,659
to explain why those reasons are

558
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,849
incorrect now the reason I'm going in

559
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:16,960
all this detail is that suppose now

560
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:19,538
you're an examiner handling the

561
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,870
first-ever chemo type patent application

562
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:24,788
for for cannabis you go through your

563
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:27,579
normal procedure you look in all the

564
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:29,109
academic literature but how much

565
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:32,019
academic literature is there on this

566
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:34,298
topic there's a little but not very much

567
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:36,548
not remotely not not even orders of

568
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:38,470
magnitude within the same amount of

569
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:40,898
literature that is typically available

570
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:45,579
for a patent search then you look at all

571
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:49,629
the prior patent literature and somewhat

572
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:52,599
surprisingly to some people the USPTO

573
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,340
has been handling and granting cannabis

574
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:58,298
related patents all the way back to the

575
00:23:54,339 --> 00:24:03,308
40s but this was the first time anyone

576
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:05,980
had tried to claim chemo type so the

577
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:08,470
examiner can't just say this seems like

578
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,450
it's too broad the examiner has to have

579
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,100
a basis for rejecting the claim the

580
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,460
examiner looks in the so called prior

581
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:17,889
art that's the whole public database of

582
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,899
prior literature academic literature or

583
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:24,190
patents and can't really find anything

584
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:26,349
or maybe find something that's kind of

585
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,820
close but not not all the way closed or

586
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:33,668
maybe find something that looks like it

587
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:36,759
but whatever the the problem in utility

588
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:40,840
patents with cannabis is that there is

589
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:42,730
just a complete disconnect between a lot

590
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,129
of prior commercial activity we know

591
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,870
that people have been enjoying chemo

592
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,690
VARs and chemo types for a long time

593
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:50,769
right but no one was documenting it

594
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,100
people were going out of their way not

595
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:56,019
to document it and so the the robust

596
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:58,928
literature that usually corresponds to a

597
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:01,298
robust commercial environment doesn't

598
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:02,890
exist for cannabis now the result of

599
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:05,168
that is that the examiner looking at

600
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,179
this didn't have access to all of the

601
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,799
commercial activity at a record of all

602
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:13,269
the commercial activity that happened

603
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:16,269
before legalization and so in a way you

604
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:19,599
think if the examiners tools for giving

605
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:21,429
a rejection our prior publications the

606
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,759
examiners just don't have the tools to

607
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:27,400
adequately examine some especially broad

608
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:30,129
patent applications relating to cannabis

609
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,880
so Dale before you before you go further

610
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:36,100
let me give voice to what a lot of

611
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,049
people are probably thinking which is

612
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:41,048
like what the eff like what you just

613
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:44,079
described is is a mess because there are

614
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:47,349
two things that we know true number one

615
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,629
there were clearly chemo VARs that had

616
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:52,418
more than three percent THC and three

617
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,730
percent CBD in the market and while

618
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:57,580
Mersin dominant sure that limits because

619
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,950
mere seen is clearly the most popular

620
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:03,099
terpene dominant team of our out there

621
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:05,919
there are absolutely plenty of chemo

622
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:08,349
VARs that are not mere sane dominant so

623
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,690
if those are your two most limiting

624
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:13,058
factors and really only need above three

625
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:17,440
percent on THC and CBD and above three

626
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:20,139
percent and excuse me and not mere seem

627
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,330
dominant I can hear people out there

628
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,270
feeling like me like we know those exist

629
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:27,819
of course those existed we you know

630
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:29,408
however the second part is is where is

631
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:31,359
the evidence because we've had to be in

632
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:34,780
the underground for all this time or we

633
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,609
didn't have analytic labs or or people

634
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:38,138
have these plants and they have not

635
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:41,918
filed them

636
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:44,019
to to get a time stamp on them it's it's

637
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,379
astonishing right I mean I you I like

638
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:49,749
how you are approaching it neutral and

639
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:52,778
Suns emotion to give us the data point

640
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:54,879
but I can since I'm not the attorney but

641
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:56,710
I can say what the hell right because

642
00:26:54,878 --> 00:27:01,418
right we know damn well that these

643
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:03,249
plants existed period and and and I now

644
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,649
understand more what I when I talk to

645
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:09,278
other experts what they often will say

646
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:11,648
is ah you know the USPTO didn't want to

647
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,839
put in the work for the research so they

648
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:15,908
granted the patent and they figured that

649
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,638
will all kick it around in court for a

650
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:19,929
few decades and it'll get sorted out but

651
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:22,839
they didn't want to be in the middle of

652
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,519
it now what you're saying though kind of

653
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:26,618
lets them off the hook to me a little

654
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:28,899
bit until I hear what you say because

655
00:27:26,618 --> 00:27:32,678
I'm like oh if this stuff has to exist

656
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:35,709
in a in a searchable form in the patent

657
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:39,038
library or in a searchable form on

658
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:41,079
Google well hell I might have a hard

659
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,528
time finding that myself and so now I'm

660
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:47,859
like alright so so before you continue

661
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:49,749
on what's your thoughts on the I don't

662
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:52,148
know let's say the attitude of the

663
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:55,720
patent and trade office did they did

664
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:57,849
they not do their job or did they do

665
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,649
their job because we are uniquely

666
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:02,319
talking about a plant that has been

667
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:04,298
prohibited it's not their fault there's

668
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,089
nothing and this is gonna have to play

669
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:11,230
out in court because the prior law

670
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:13,678
doesn't exist I will start by saying I'm

671
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,999
no apologist for the Patent Office I

672
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,389
I've worked with the Patent Office for

673
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:21,038
23 years and there are good examiner's

674
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:22,979
and bad examiner's at the Patent Office

675
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,769
just like there are in any organization

676
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:29,919
but if the examiners ever try to take a

677
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:33,480
shortcut or do the safe thing it is to

678
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:36,788
just refuse to allow a claim I've I've

679
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,700
in addition to my practice in cannabis

680
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:40,990
I've worked a lot in biotech and and

681
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,819
cancer and other things like that and

682
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,358
I've certainly done battle with

683
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:50,079
examiner's for years trying to get some

684
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:51,939
some claims to cancer treatment allowed

685
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,649
they were brought claim

686
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,870
but the examiner couldn't find anything

687
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,910
that was right on point but was still

688
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:59,949
very very hesitant to allow the claims

689
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,320
because he didn't want to get

690
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,410
second-guessed in the Patent Office and

691
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,359
he certainly didn't want to have his his

692
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:10,110
patent associated with some ugly

693
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:14,139
litigation over its validity or

694
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:17,319
associated with you know become kind of

695
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,840
almost a household topic a dinner table

696
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:24,849
topic about how the examiner didn't do

697
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:26,859
his job and so my my answer to people

698
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:30,759
who say that the Patent Office just just

699
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:32,679
punted on this is that notwithstanding

700
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:35,379
my frustrations with many patent

701
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,110
examiner's they are much more likely to

702
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,970
just say no than to say yes but they

703
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:43,389
have to have some remote basis for

704
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:45,700
saying no and it has to be defensible

705
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,740
and if they just don't have any

706
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,480
literature they can cite they can't just

707
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,799
have a feeling and they can't there's a

708
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,990
limit to how much independent

709
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,450
investigation they can do one thing they

710
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:58,960
can do and that I want to encourage the

711
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:02,620
Patent Office to do more is to actually

712
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,700
put the applicants on the spot with what

713
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:07,799
are called requests for information and

714
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,970
sometimes when a patent examiner

715
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:13,930
believes that there must be something

716
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:16,509
out there that they haven't been able to

717
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,490
find but that must still be out there

718
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:21,190
they can they can ask they can issue a

719
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:24,160
request for information so for example I

720
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:27,190
was handling a plant patent on a mango

721
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,320
in Australia and the examiner couldn't

722
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,970
find any evidence that the plant itself

723
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:34,119
had been commercially available but he

724
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,460
did find something in in a fruit

725
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,439
catalogue that listed this that the

726
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,910
fruit itself is having been commercially

727
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,990
available and he said I'm putting it on

728
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:46,810
you to tell me on the record whether

729
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:48,819
those trees were ever sold to anyone

730
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:50,169
where the trees ever publicly available

731
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:52,089
that's what you're trying to patent and

732
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,920
I see evidence this evidence gives me

733
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:55,990
enough to ask you to put it to say on

734
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,640
the record what was actually going on

735
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,640
that how did this fruit get into

736
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,290
commercial availability and so we had to

737
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,000
investigate that and we were able to

738
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:06,079
supply enough information to make it

739
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,460
clear that

740
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,798
while the fruit had been available the

741
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,329
plants hadn't been and and that mattered

742
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:14,719
I won't go into all the details of that

743
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:19,418
but it is up to the examiner if there's

744
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:22,429
any shred of indication that something

745
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,929
may have gone on that they just didn't

746
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:27,440
that don't have access to in their

747
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:30,440
database they can force the applicant to

748
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,629
to state on the record what they know or

749
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,340
to characterize the historical situation

750
00:31:32,628 --> 00:31:38,468
and I think what happened in this case

751
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:40,728
is there's so little about prior

752
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:42,080
existence it's a syllable published or

753
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:44,119
accessible information about prior

754
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,249
existence of this kimo type especially

755
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:47,959
and we should emphasize this especially

756
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:49,749
when the examiner was looking at this

757
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,159
there's been a lot of information

758
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:54,048
published since then about people

759
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,919
reacting to this patent but when the

760
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:59,989
examiner had this in front of him or her

761
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:04,089
they didn't even have enough to issue a

762
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:08,899
request for information so in the future

763
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:10,368
I'm hoping that patent examiner's

764
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:13,368
looking at these kinds of things well

765
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:19,009
what I'd really like to see is have

766
00:32:13,368 --> 00:32:20,718
people be less inclined to do what our

767
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:23,628
people are calling the equivalent of a

768
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:25,909
land grab or a gold rush on broad patent

769
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:27,738
claims they have people seek claims that

770
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:31,639
are more narrowly directed to what they

771
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:34,419
actually bred and created but I would

772
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:37,788
also like the examiners to feel more

773
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:39,619
equipped to issue these requests for

774
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:41,148
information and say alright I can't find

775
00:32:39,618 --> 00:32:43,038
anything in the prior art but I know

776
00:32:41,148 --> 00:32:46,758
that there was a whole closet industry

777
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:49,098
or an underground industry here and so I

778
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,229
want you to show to tell me how you

779
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:53,528
characterize prior unpublished

780
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:56,210
commercial activity in this space and

781
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:57,558
that doesn't make the applicant that

782
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,509
doesn't give the applicant of duty to do

783
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,548
it in that in independent investigation

784
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:03,469
but it does put them in a position where

785
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:05,658
they have to say on the record what they

786
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:08,269
know about that why don't you think the

787
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:10,009
Patent Office asked that I think they

788
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:12,278
just didn't know enough about the

789
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:16,878
industry you know the patent examiner's

790
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:19,250
probably are not the same ones that that

791
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:21,109
were really familiar

792
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,339
with a great variety of chemo types from

793
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:23,869
their own personal use of their own

794
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:27,558
personal experience in the industry and

795
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:29,779
so I don't think it it stood out that

796
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:33,829
that was something that was even likely

797
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:36,798
to exist in and in this patent in this

798
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:38,808
patent examiner's experience now this is

799
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,099
a few years ago and there's been as we

800
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,839
all know there's been a hell of a lot of

801
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:43,879
talk about it since then and people do

802
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,099
have the same reaction that you had

803
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,630
which is of course this isn't new

804
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:49,819
maybe it's never been published but of

805
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:52,520
course it's not new and that's what I've

806
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:55,849
heard a lot of people say but I think

807
00:33:52,519 --> 00:34:00,250
the patent examiner just didn't didn't

808
00:33:55,849 --> 00:34:04,519
have that same kind of instant reaction

809
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:06,380
and didn't have a real basis for issuing

810
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,908
a request for information plus I will

811
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,159
say requests for information are pretty

812
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:12,829
rare they usually come when you find

813
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,510
when you find a document that points you

814
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:17,299
in a direction it just doesn't get you

815
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:20,419
all the way there to a valid rejection

816
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,220
and so then the examiner says I'm going

817
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:26,000
to rely on this for a rejection unless

818
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:28,128
you can convince me that I shouldn't so

819
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,309
I could go into a lot more detail about

820
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:34,549
this but but basically I I to answer

821
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:35,898
your original question I don't think

822
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,940
this was a case of the Patent Office

823
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:40,598
taking the easy way out I think it was

824
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,470
them working with the tools they had and

825
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,240
recognizing that there was a limit to

826
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:46,009
what they could do and not having any

827
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,769
kind of genuine legal basis for

828
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,659
rejecting this they went ahead and

829
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:52,759
allowed it but the other part of what

830
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:56,240
you said really is true if this is going

831
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,670
to play itself out in the public

832
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,729
discourse like this and if they ever

833
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,619
choose to enforce this patent against an

834
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,260
alleged infringer then I think there

835
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:07,849
will probably be all kinds of people in

836
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,630
the industry that will come forward and

837
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:15,010
say okay well here's here's a cultivar

838
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:18,369
that we can show existed prior to 2013

839
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:21,380
that has this this chemical profile

840
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:23,480
again I'm not saying I haven't done my

841
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,670
own investigation but you know I've

842
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,179
heard your reaction lots of times and so

843
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:30,680
if that's factually accurate probably

844
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:32,358
multiple people will come forward and

845
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,779
defend whoever gets sued for patent

846
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,789
infringement

847
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,530
and say here's our evidence that this

848
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:38,389
claim doesn't meet the novelty

849
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,340
requirement and therefore is not valid

850
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:42,589
you know that's really interesting now

851
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,740
what what they've got essentially is an

852
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:48,289
over broad patent that exists unless

853
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:50,449
they were to try to defend it at which

854
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:53,029
case everything would be put into

855
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:54,439
question again and and I don't know it's

856
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,240
odd the idea that there's an

857
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,789
unenforceable patent it's like they're

858
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,649
their best strategy maybe just to not

859
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,619
try to but then what value does it have

860
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:06,470
it's a very interesting legal position

861
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:08,029
it certainly got them a lot of press I

862
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:10,519
wouldn't say it's all good press

863
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:13,970
obviously but I actually haven't heard

864
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:17,349
any of it I haven't either but there

865
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:19,879
there are some other nuances that to

866
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:21,949
patent strategy that they did employ

867
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,990
that you know we've we've been talking

868
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:26,419
about is a very broadest claim and it

869
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:28,939
sounds like that broadest claim is quite

870
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,460
vulnerable to an attack for lack of

871
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,559
novelty they have a series of narrower

872
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,530
claims and maybe there's some narrower

873
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:38,329
claim that actually would define the

874
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,120
invention specifically enough that it

875
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:43,699
would be new and would hold up in court

876
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,380
and then the question is would there be

877
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:46,909
anybody out there who's infringing that

878
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,440
particular claim because it would be

879
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:50,690
narrower and a lot harder to infringe

880
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,500
and that's just you know that's a matter

881
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:56,329
for a matter to be sorted out

882
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,519
it when there are specific facts on the

883
00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:02,539
table one other thing I'll say though is

884
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:04,880
that this is this kind of risk of your

885
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:06,650
own patents validity when you sue

886
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,740
someone for patent infringement is

887
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:11,960
that's that's standard in patent

888
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:15,799
litigation I've worked with lots of

889
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:18,409
clients where before they decided

890
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,380
whether to assert their patent they did

891
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:23,539
kind of a double check to see what are

892
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,660
the what are the greatest the most

893
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:28,730
viable challenges to validity that

894
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:30,129
someone could pose for our patent do we

895
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,240
really believe our patent is valid

896
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,820
because if we don't we don't want to

897
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,559
spend millions of dollars litigating it

898
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,110
and we don't want to come out of that

899
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:45,340
process with an invalidated patent and

900
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:46,700
so in in the real world in kind of more

901
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:50,000
mature

902
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:52,309
established industries people recognize

903
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,769
that getting an overbroad patent is

904
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:58,250
mostly a waste of money because you

905
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:59,750
can't enforce it or at least you're

906
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:03,980
really risking losing it when you

907
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:06,320
enforce it sometimes though people will

908
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,969
pursue broad patents in the hopes that

909
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,830
they can become part of a licensing

910
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:12,079
scheme that they can make it more

911
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:14,150
attractive to take a somewhat

912
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,940
troublesome but not prohibitively

913
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,680
expensive license just as insurance

914
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,730
against ever having to defend yourself

915
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:25,129
from from a patent infringement suit so

916
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,420
you know that there are a lot of things

917
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,410
that someone can do with a patent

918
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:32,059
besides winning a case in court and I am

919
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:34,519
not privy to what the strategy was

920
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,380
behind this but I will say that I've

921
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:39,139
heard your reaction a lot of times as to

922
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,300
the novelty now I did because I got so

923
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:43,519
many questions about chemo type patents

924
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,050
generally and about people you know

925
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,420
coming up with something that's really

926
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:50,810
new and then wanting to claim more than

927
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:53,119
just their own genetic developments that

928
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:55,340
I did write a blog about that too so if

929
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,009
you go to plant law calm I have a lot of

930
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,260
detail about what it would take to

931
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:02,390
actually get a valid chemo type patent

932
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:07,550
and why it's probably a bad idea to even

933
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:09,670
try right on so so um so before we go to

934
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,780
our first commercial Dale I know that I

935
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:14,720
changed your path and took you down this

936
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,370
rabbit hole so you know obviously we're

937
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,509
not going to cover all the all the

938
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:22,880
vagaries of the biotech LLC patent today

939
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,380
but is there anything that is in your

940
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,630
notes where you're like I need to get

941
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,690
this in before we go to commercial and

942
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,070
come back and talk about United cannabis

943
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:35,500
no I think that pretty much covers it

944
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:40,460
it's just kind of sum it up to say that

945
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:45,050
it's it's a matter of I think everyone

946
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:47,449
who dislikes this patent should almost

947
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,450
do their civic duty to identify whatever

948
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:54,139
evidence they're personally aware of

949
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:56,569
that would that would would fall within

950
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:58,670
the scope of these claims because if

951
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,510
this ever if this ever does get enforced

952
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,200
and if it is as invalid

953
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:06,990
as people say it is then there will be

954
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,669
someone who meets help and so if people

955
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:10,279
in the community are outraged by this

956
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,200
patent the call to action would be

957
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,600
document what you know that was prior to

958
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:19,769
2013 and be ready to step up and help

959
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:22,289
your neighbor I think that's that's a

960
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:25,639
good call to action I think that's great

961
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:28,380
deal it's not only is it crowdsourcing

962
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:31,230
from within our community but it's also

963
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,780
citizen science kind of stuff and and

964
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,990
we're big supporters of both so so if

965
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:40,970
any of you have got evidence of these

966
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:45,569
kima VARs that existed prior to the 2013

967
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:48,239
save that evidence before they dusted

968
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,410
I'm so with that we're gonna take our

969
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,329
first short break and be right back

970
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:53,250
you're listening to shaping fire and my

971
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:56,340
guest today is plant scientist and

972
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,380
patent attorney Dale hunt growing

973
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,600
cannabis in greenhouses is taking over

974
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,490
the cannabis industry an efficient and

975
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,559
effective blend of sunshine grown

976
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:06,989
terpene profiles and the controlled

977
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,090
environment of indoor greenhouses can be

978
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:11,159
the best of both worlds for many

979
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,200
greenhouse operators though building

980
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,239
their greenhouse before gaining insight

981
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,399
into how cannabis greenhouses differ

982
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,659
from ornamental crops can be the start

983
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,660
of a world of hurt

984
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:23,940
eric Branstad and his team at greenhouse

985
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:26,069
advisory group have the experience and

986
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,679
technical know-how to help you avoid

987
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,750
these pitfalls Eric Branstad has been

988
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:33,480
helping cannabis growers find locations

989
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,639
design build and equip their greenhouses

990
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,590
for over a decade first starting in

991
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:39,269
Northern California but expanding over

992
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:41,100
the last five years to helping clients

993
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,360
throughout the world he has an

994
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,849
impeccable reputation

995
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,309
for both depth of knowledge and kindness

996
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:48,809
and communication you can hear Eric

997
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:50,820
explains some of the challenges facing

998
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:53,699
cannabis greenhouses and how to overcome

999
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,940
them in episode number 41 of the shaping

1000
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:59,039
fire podcast no matter where I go in the

1001
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,869
country good people with smart

1002
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,509
backgrounds still are making the mistake

1003
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:05,609
of building without knowing cannabis and

1004
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:08,280
it causes them to burn through capital

1005
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:10,769
and time fast everyone has their own

1006
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,750
failure point for some it is improper

1007
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:14,550
ventilation planning for others it is

1008
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,849
surface temperatures of the building or

1009
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,370
the

1010
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:18,839
plants leaves or both some folks that

1011
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:20,849
build their greenhouse from scratch make

1012
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,710
really basic errors like placement of

1013
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:23,969
the greenhouse on the property or not

1014
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,559
understanding the natural environment

1015
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:27,869
where the greenhouse sits

1016
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:30,059
some have even built a decent greenhouse

1017
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,559
but are inefficient in their deployment

1018
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:33,860
of light deprivation techniques and

1019
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,179
never really hit their target yields

1020
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,070
it's great when you learn from your

1021
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,199
mistakes but it's even better when you

1022
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:42,390
learn from the mistakes of others when

1023
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,039
you bring on greenhouse advisory group

1024
00:42:42,389 --> 00:42:45,929
you will learn from the mistakes of

1025
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,519
their many clients and you'll take

1026
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:49,769
advantage of the best practices

1027
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,599

as a listener of shaping fire you

1038
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,829
already understand the importance of

1039
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,660
living soil when growing cannabis when

1040
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:20,880
you have active microbe communities in

1041
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:22,949
your substrate you go way beyond simply

1042
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,650
fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and

1043
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:27,659
potassium having active microorganisms

1044
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:29,490
in your substrate supports vigorous

1045

1057
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,210
but the microbes act as a defense shield

1058
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,250
for the plants rhizosphere

1059

mammoth pee not only unlocks the

1062
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:08,699
nutrients in your soil but it also helps

1063
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:10,650
protect your plant from disease mammoth

1064
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:13,949

1065
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:16,860
microbial reactors continually producing

1066
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:18,689
enzymes that release nutrients mammoth

1067
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,789
pee was developed at a u.s. university

1068
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,650
has been extensively tested by Colorado

1069
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:25,230
growers and independent laboratories

1070
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:27,930
mammoth pee is proven to increase growth

1071
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,750
and enhance blooming one of the great

1072
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:30,789
things about

1073
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,679
with microorganisms is that they won't

1074
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:35,019
compete with whatever fertilizer program

1075

thriving cannabis mammoth pee welcome

1083
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:56,769
back you are listening to shaping fire

1084
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,690
I'm your host Shango Lowe's and our

1085
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:02,139
guest this week is plant scientist and

1086
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,980
patent attorney Dale hunt so I thought

1087
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:08,349
we were gonna get through both of the

1088
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:11,079
troublesome patents in the first set but

1089
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:13,269
there's a lot more to the biotech to

1090
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,769
talk about than I thought and so let's

1091
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:17,619
go ahead and we'll start waiting into

1092
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:20,289
the United cannabis patent just like we

1093
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:22,299
did the biotech LLC you so Dale if you

1094
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:23,920
would take us through a general

1095
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,510
explanation so people understand the

1096
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,460
context of what we're talking about and

1097
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,500
then dive into the two sides of the

1098
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,849
debate so people can really grok what's

1099
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,650
going on that would be really

1100
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:35,679
appreciated you bet

1101
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:40,210
so this time we're talking about u.s.

1102
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:41,559
patent number 9 7 3 0 9 1 1 so if anyone

1103
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:47,380
wants to google that and pull it up

1104
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:48,969
again it's 9 7 3 0 9 1 1 and this is a

1105
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,240
patent that was granted to United

1106
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:54,639
cannabis claim 1 is really short and

1107
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,369
really easy to understand so I'll read

1108
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:59,920
it verbatim a liquid cannabinoid

1109
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:02,339
formulation we're in at least 95 percent

1110
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:06,300
of the total cannabinoids is

1111
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:09,220
tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid or THC a

1112
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:14,170
that's it so they're claiming to have

1113
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:16,299
invented and I don't actually have the

1114
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,860
priority date here I could I could get

1115
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,750
that before during the next commercial

1116
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,280
break but they're claiming to have

1117
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,130
invented I think it was before about

1118
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,400
2015 to be the first people to have ever

1119
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:30,910
had a liquid cannabinoid formulation

1120
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,099
that is at least 95 percent THC a and

1121
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:35,559
you know in the last one we only looked

1122
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:37,029
at claim one but here it's important to

1123
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,659
emphasize that they also have

1124
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:42,809
independent claims 5 if you're following

1125
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:46,768
along at home look at claim 5

1126
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:50,548
claimed 10 claimed 16 claimed 20 and

1127
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:52,468
claimed 25 and here's why they all have

1128
00:46:50,548 --> 00:46:54,748
the same phrasing a liquid cannabinoid

1129
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:56,818
formulation where where in at least 95

1130
00:46:54,748 --> 00:47:00,928
percent of the total cannabinoid is and

1131
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:06,418
then claimed one is THC a claimed 5 is

1132
00:47:00,929 --> 00:47:09,918
THC claimed 10 is CBD claimed 16 is a

1133
00:47:06,418 --> 00:47:14,598
combination of THC a and CBD CBD a

1134
00:47:09,918 --> 00:47:22,708
claimed 20 is THC and CBD together and

1135
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:25,439
claimed 20 is CBD CBN and THC so what

1136
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:28,219
that means is these this patent

1137
00:47:25,438 --> 00:47:30,808
applicant went to the patent office

1138
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:33,659
claiming to have been the first to ever

1139
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:36,509
have in their possession to have to have

1140
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:38,630
made a liquid cannabinoid formulation

1141
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:40,769
that was 95 percent of one thing as

1142
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:43,409
compared to all the other cannabinoids

1143
00:47:40,768 --> 00:47:44,968
in the mix now what's important to

1144
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:47,519
understand is that the way you interpret

1145
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:48,409
this claim it doesn't mean that it's 95

1146
00:47:47,518 --> 00:47:51,928
percent pure

1147
00:47:48,409 --> 00:47:55,259
it could be it's any liquid it's any

1148
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:59,849
liquid that has cannabinoids in it where

1149
00:47:55,259 --> 00:48:01,559
95% of the cannabinoids in it are one

1150
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:04,199
thing the thing that's claimed and the

1151
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:07,048
other 5% or less is some other

1152
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:10,829
cannabinoid let's poke at that for a

1153
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:14,248
second yeah so so the two things that

1154
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:19,859
stand out for me are number one would

1155
00:48:14,248 --> 00:48:23,009
this include a solution that was 95

1156
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:26,880
percent THC isolate and then five

1157
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:29,909
percent vehicle solution yes because

1158
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,759
that would make it a hundred percent THC

1159
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:38,189
and the claim is at least 95 percent I

1160
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:41,969
see so it's it's it's not 95 percent of

1161
00:48:38,188 --> 00:48:44,038
the total solution right that's exactly

1162
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:45,949
it that that whatever else is in the

1163
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:51,329
solution that's what makes this claim

1164
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:53,548
really breathtakingly broad yeah is that

1165
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:55,409
it doesn't matter what else is in the

1166
00:48:53,548 --> 00:48:56,369
solution it doesn't matter how clean the

1167
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:57,990
solution is Lee

1168
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:59,910
by a conventional interpretation of the

1169
00:48:57,989 --> 00:49:02,969
claim the plain language of this claim

1170
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:05,429
it is just that of the total

1171
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:07,649
cannabinoids at least 95 percent is

1172
00:49:05,429 --> 00:49:09,899
whatever they call that's that

1173
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:11,160
clarification is huge right it's not

1174
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,740
right because like at first when you

1175
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:16,139
were reading it I'm like okay well you

1176
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:20,578
know my specialty is not extraction

1177
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:23,038
right but and and when I'm you know

1178
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:25,470
seeing tests for analytics for DAB oils

1179
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:28,109
and RSOs and things like that you know

1180
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:30,899
they'll they'll float between 55 and 85

1181
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:33,389
pretty easily well yeah 95 percent for

1182
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,269
an extracted oil is pretty high in in

1183
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:39,480
any situation but the fact that that

1184
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:44,998
what it describes as oh not the oil how

1185
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:49,740
it comes out of the plant but any fluid

1186
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:53,699
that 95% of the cannabinoids are one of

1187
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:56,038
our target cannabinoids that suddenly

1188
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:59,699
makes it from huh curious - holy crap

1189
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:02,278
laughable yeah and and that's it's it's

1190
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:04,048
so strange credulity that I do urge

1191
00:50:02,278 --> 00:50:05,849
people to google it and read the claim

1192
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:07,349
for yourself and I'll read it one more

1193
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:09,989
time in the context of what you just

1194
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:12,150
said it's a liquid cannabinoid

1195
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:14,548
formulation so it's just a formulation

1196
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,950
in a liquid state that has some

1197
00:50:14,548 --> 00:50:19,829
cannabinoids in it a liquid cannabinoid

1198
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:23,759
formulation wherein at least 95 percent

1199
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:27,180
of the total cannabinoids is whatever

1200
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:29,400
they call out is THC ETH CA CBD that

1201
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:30,659
they have a series of claims that claim

1202
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,028
each one of these as a separate

1203
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:35,278
invention that observe of the total

1204
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:35,940
cannabinoids is a major phrase right

1205
00:50:35,278 --> 00:50:41,278
there

1206
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:44,159
it sure is it sure is so obviously again

1207
00:50:41,278 --> 00:50:46,349
I will point out that I haven't done any

1208
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,899
chemical analysis on this I haven't even

1209
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:51,720
done any any literature research all I

1210
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,568
have all I'm doing is processing the

1211
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:57,389
reactions of people who have first-hand

1212
00:50:54,568 --> 00:51:01,920
experience in the industry and their

1213
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:04,679
reaction is so far I not exaggerating to

1214
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,079
say it's uniformly what the hell or

1215
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:09,690
something like that is it's uniformed

1216
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:14,880
incredulity that that

1217
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:17,010
this claim is would be a post-2015

1218
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,980
invention and didn't exist before that

1219
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:22,590
so do I know I know that you roll with

1220
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,750
these like serious patent people and

1221
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:26,579
plant science people because I know

1222
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:30,090
you're talking with them like on stage

1223
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:32,579
and before you go on stage and and do

1224
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:35,130
you know what their position is on this

1225
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:36,840
how you know what their fallback is how

1226
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:41,160
would they respond to this do you know

1227
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:43,260
that well what I hear I mean for some

1228
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:45,629
reason maybe just because it came first

1229
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,430
or maybe because it's it's actually into

1230
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:49,920
chemo types and people care about their

1231
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:53,359
their chemo type their there their chemo

1232
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:56,309
type profiles I still pick up a lot more

1233
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:59,010
upset and outrage and stress and

1234
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:02,130
frustration about the biotech LLC patent

1235
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:05,040
family but but when people do talk about

1236
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:09,090
this one and focus on this one it's just

1237
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:12,029
kind of a it's an almost mutely

1238
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:13,320
astonish'd reaction that this just can't

1239
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,660
be

1240
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:20,400
again I'm passing along there their

1241
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:24,299
reaction to it and I think maybe it's

1242
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:27,420
it's that mutely astonished either

1243
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:30,480
because it creates a sense of complete

1244
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:32,460
defeat or it creates a sense of ok well

1245
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,369
this there's just no way this can stand

1246
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,440
in any in any just situation and what's

1247
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:39,929
interesting about this is this patent

1248
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,619
has been asserted this is in active

1249
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:48,629
litigation in Colorado right now do tell

1250
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:52,589
ok so you can sued a group called the

1251
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:54,690
pure hemp collective and sued them on

1252
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:57,690
the basis of some CBD formulations that

1253
00:52:54,690 --> 00:53:00,269
they were selling and this case I

1254
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:05,039
believe it was initiated last July give

1255
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:06,630
or take and so you know then there was a

1256
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,300
little bit of an outcry about alright

1257
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:11,309
what's going to happen here is the court

1258
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,740
even going to hear this because one of

1259
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:17,699
the questions before this case happened

1260
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:22,439
was will a court even will a federal

1261
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:23,509
court even permit patent litigation to

1262
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,190
proceed

1263
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:29,510
if the subject matter the patent claims

1264
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:32,480
overlaps with something that's federally

1265
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:35,030
illegal some people thought it would

1266
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,719
just get thrown out now there there are

1267
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:39,950
at least two reasons well there's a one

1268
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:42,079
really good counterpoint I've heard

1269
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:44,689
which is alright maybe some of these

1270
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:49,608
claims cover THC just like well like

1271
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:54,079
claim one and claim five and claim ten

1272
00:53:49,608 --> 00:53:58,549
and so on not Clinton to claim 16 but

1273
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:00,349
the the product that was being sold

1274
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:03,440
commercially was not federally illegal

1275
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:05,750
it was a CBD product and so you know the

1276
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,990
people who want to maintain hope that a

1277
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:10,840
federal court would never entertain

1278
00:54:08,989 --> 00:54:14,269
patent enforcement litigation over

1279
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,039
something that was all about THC they

1280
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:18,440
can still hold that hope out because in

1281
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:20,719
this case tea a THC product is not the

1282
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,210
accused product it's the CBD product and

1283
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:26,868
that might make a difference the other

1284
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:28,699
part of it though is just that I would

1285
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:31,340
think you know the argument I would make

1286
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:34,099
in favor of a court hearing a case like

1287
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:36,650
this is look this is a federal agency

1288
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:39,230
that granted this right it's a federal

1289
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:43,550
right and you're a federal court so do

1290
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:45,349
your job right and in this case if if

1291
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:48,350
we're to believe everyone that says that

1292
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:49,579
these claims just aren't new the job of

1293
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:53,569
the court would be to hear all the

1294
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:56,779
evidence and eventually to find that

1295
00:54:53,570 --> 00:55:00,890
there's enough evidence of prior

1296
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:03,650
commercial activity involving basically

1297
00:55:00,889 --> 00:55:05,358
prior public availability of liquid

1298
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:07,309
cannabinoid formulations that fall

1299
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,108
within the scope of these claims to

1300
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:11,509
invalidate the claims that were asserted

1301
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:13,190
and that's that's another bit of

1302
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:15,080
esoterica that is worth discussing

1303
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:17,690
when you sue someone for patent

1304
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:19,909
infringement you typically say that

1305
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,500
they're infringing claims x y&amp;z you call

1306
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:23,509
out the specific claims that they're

1307
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:27,559
that you're accusing them of infringing

1308
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:29,900
and then they have a right to petition

1309
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:32,929
for declaratory judgment by the court

1310
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,910
that those claims are invalid but they

1311
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:36,799
they can only invalidate the claims that

1312
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:37,489
are inserted asserted against them the

1313
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,430
other claims

1314
00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:42,289
aren't in play so the outcome of this

1315
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:47,739
litigation I believe that it was just

1316
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:51,710
claims and I think it was claims 10 and

1317
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:53,299
16 and 20 that were asserted because

1318
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:57,230
those are the claims that recite some

1319
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:58,700
amount of CBD in the formulation and so

1320
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:01,010
those are the claims that would be at

1321
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:03,710
risk and it could be invalidated in this

1322
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:05,090
litigation but that wouldn't touch the

1323
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,010
other claims that were not asserted

1324
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:09,530
alright so taking this back away from

1325
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:12,140
the just the generalized incredulity

1326
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:14,180
other in whatever yeah

1327
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:17,239
at this point of the show the lips

1328
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:19,009
aren't working as well so so we're all

1329
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:21,139
astonished that it was granted but

1330
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:23,540
beyond that you know if we go back to

1331
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:27,379
the beginning and talk about the biotech

1332
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:29,360
LLC issues part of it is where is this

1333
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:31,579
stuff and the historical record right

1334
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:35,500
because everybody was underground in the

1335
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:39,559
medical days things were not archived as

1336
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:41,960
often and without evidence the patent

1337
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:45,829
and trade office doesn't have anything

1338
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,150
to turn down a patent on I'm thinking

1339
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:48,440
that we're gonna run into that that

1340
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:52,039
we're in the middle of that same

1341
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:53,720
situation now and and the folks who have

1342
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:55,460
are you know are having to defend

1343
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:59,239
themselves against these patent claims

1344
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:01,159
they're probably trying to find any kind

1345
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:02,809
of evidence that's out there showing

1346
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:06,049
pre-existing art and that might be a

1347
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:09,650
really difficult thing that's it is very

1348
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:11,630
difficult and I think I I kind of talked

1349
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:14,030
about this topic a lot at different

1350
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:17,420
meetings and one of the things I say is

1351
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:19,160
that I believe that that the patent

1352
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:23,150
system the utility patent system is

1353
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:25,460
going to have a problem with the with

1354
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:27,740
the so-called presumption of validity of

1355
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,179
an issued patent when it comes to to

1356
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:30,319
cannabis utility patents they're gonna

1357
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,849
have that problem for a generation

1358
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,910
because it's going to take it a full

1359
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:37,460
generation to have an academic

1360
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:40,489
literature and a patent literature that

1361
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:42,740
is comparable even even comparable to

1362
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:44,329
the kind of academic literature and

1363
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:46,089
patent literature that examiner's

1364
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:49,429
usually search when they're looking for

1365
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:51,440
looking to analyze the the novelty and

1366
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:55,759
non-obviousness of a claim

1367
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,349
and so see when a patent issues the

1368
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,030
courts treat it with the so called

1369
00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:00,740
presumption of validity which just means

1370
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:02,450
that they presume that the patent that

1371
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:04,729
the patent examination process was done

1372
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:07,460
correctly and that that the patent was

1373
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:09,559
issued properly and what that

1374
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,690
presumption means is that the defendant

1375
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:13,519
who's trying to invalidate the patent

1376
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,920
has a higher hurdle of evidence to

1377
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,568
submit in order to actually get the

1378
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,240
patent invalidated it's not just like a

1379
00:58:17,568 --> 00:58:21,710
50-50 okay you win this coin toss you

1380
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:23,479
have to have what is called clear and

1381
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:27,199
convincing evidence of patent and

1382
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:29,358
validity and but I do think that this

1383
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,608
presumption of validity it will it's

1384
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:33,619
based on the idea that the Patent Office

1385
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:36,288
did its job and had the right tools to

1386
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:38,539
do its job and I think that when it

1387
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:41,030
comes to broad cannabis utility patents

1388
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:43,220
since there's essentially no prior art

1389
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:46,220
or you know no no significant prior art

1390
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:48,558
it's it's maybe 1% or less of the prior

1391
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:51,889
art in other industries the searchable

1392
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:56,119
usable prior art that is a tool and of

1393
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:58,250
an examiner's job that that because of

1394
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,170
that this presumption of validity is

1395
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,329
just much much weaker it has to be

1396
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:06,440
weaker because we know that there was in

1397
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:08,589
parallel with all this lack of published

1398
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:10,909
literature there was a very robust

1399
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:15,230
commercial activity still happening it

1400
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:18,608
was just not documented okay so a couple

1401
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:21,769
things so the first thing is is so

1402
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:23,778
outside of any potential American

1403
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:25,759
companies that might have made these

1404
00:59:23,778 --> 00:59:26,659
products and had evidence of them being

1405
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,770
brought to market

1406
00:59:26,659 --> 00:59:34,190
how about non-us companies say like GW

1407
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:37,309
Pharma who I would suggest probably had

1408
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:41,920
such a had a thing that they had created

1409
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:44,329
in the lab but had not brought to market

1410
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,400
how does that play out the fact that

1411
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:48,829
they are a British company and not an

1412
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:52,760
American company and the fact that they

1413
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:55,430
had not yet brought it to market you're

1414
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,230
asking in terms of what what their role

1415
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:59,449
would be in terms of creating prior art

1416
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:03,159
yeah correct so so would would this

1417
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:04,689
would this serum that was more than 95%

1418
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:08,529
THC

1419
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:13,230
and or CBD the fact that it just existed

1420
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:17,079
in the world is prior art enough to

1421
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:20,679
unravel something this yes well not

1422
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:23,369
quite because the prior art has to be

1423
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:26,019
has to be evidence of either prior

1424
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:29,829
excuse me prior public public knowledge

1425
01:00:26,019 --> 01:00:30,940
or prior public availability and so it

1426
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:34,180
has to be either be a printed

1427
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:37,059
publication or on sale or somehow some

1428
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:39,368
kind of commercial availability so if GW

1429
01:00:37,059 --> 01:00:43,780
Pharma was publishing studies that

1430
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:45,670
involved that kind of a solution in the

1431
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:47,740
research that would be that would count

1432
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:49,869
as public knowledge right absolutely

1433
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:53,439
anything that's published is considered

1434
01:00:49,869 --> 01:00:56,349
public knowledge so Dale if if this is

1435
01:00:53,440 --> 01:01:00,309
already being litigated right now in

1436
01:00:56,349 --> 01:01:02,200
Colorado and and these folks are trying

1437
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:05,559
to defend their product against the

1438
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:07,598
patent claims of United cannabis what is

1439
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:09,940
the where we at with it right now where

1440
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,710
are we at with that litigation and are

1441
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,880
we starting to get a smell of how this

1442
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,789
is gonna play out because this is a

1443
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,559
pretty big deal for the whole industry

1444
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:18,849
yeah it really is interesting one of the

1445
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:21,430
things that happens when someone gets

1446
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:23,680
sued for patent infringement is that

1447
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:26,858
they have a deadline to provide an

1448
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:28,899
answer to the complaint and in the in

1449
01:01:26,858 --> 01:01:31,719
the answer by pure hemp collective they

1450
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:34,809
listed all kinds of products that that

1451
01:01:31,719 --> 01:01:38,048
were allegedly available here they're

1452
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:40,740
commercially and that that already met

1453
01:01:38,048 --> 01:01:44,259
the standard of being 95 plus percent

1454
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:47,469
CBD as part of whatever other things

1455
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:51,250
were present in the liquid you know so

1456
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:53,318
there are things that were 99% CBD in a

1457
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:56,528
liquid formulation or something so they

1458
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:58,558
put all that evidence into well they put

1459
01:01:56,528 --> 01:02:03,608
they put assertions that such evidence

1460
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:04,809
existed into their answer but for the

1461
01:02:03,608 --> 01:02:07,420
all that evidence to really be

1462
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:10,569
considered the case would have to go all

1463
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:12,338
the way to trial there are some things

1464
01:02:10,568 --> 01:02:14,409
that can happen pretrial and one of

1465
01:02:12,338 --> 01:02:16,150
those things was pretty interesting they

1466
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:17,849
suit for what is called summary judgment

1467
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,680
they mow they they moved for

1468
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:25,650
summary judgment partial summary

1469
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:29,940
judgment as to some of the claims on the

1470
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:31,710
basis that what was really being claimed

1471
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:33,990
was a product of nature and therefore

1472
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:36,800
unpatentable under Section 101 if you

1473
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:39,659
remember from the previous segment and

1474
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:43,170
so there was because that didn't require

1475
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:46,170
any particular amount of evidence it was

1476
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:48,269
really more of a question of objective

1477
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:51,450
scientific fact and applying the law to

1478
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:53,489
that fact the judge was able to handle

1479
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:56,449
that motion without ceding a jury or

1480
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:58,799
without going all the way into trial and

1481
01:02:56,449 --> 01:03:00,960
because of some of the the evidentiary

1482
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,670
standards and so on there they're only

1483
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,630
certain things that you can even put

1484
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:08,369
into a motion like that but what they

1485
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:11,430
they did ask the judge to consider

1486
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:13,650
whether this was an unpatentable product

1487
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:15,839
of nature and after both sides made

1488
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:20,250
their arguments that the patent owner

1489
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:21,809
you can argued that the product of

1490
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:24,570
nature that that comes straight out of

1491
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:26,820
the plant is not a liquid it's it's a

1492
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:32,130
soft solid and you know people who've

1493
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:34,530
done resins and and other kinds of you

1494
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:36,000
know crude extractions you know they can

1495
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,830
all have their own opinion about what it

1496
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,480
is that comes out when you just what

1497
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:43,610
what is really present in the trichome

1498
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:46,949
is it a liquid or is it a soft solid but

1499
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:48,900
the judge considered the two the two

1500
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:51,000
possibilities if the judge had found it

1501
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:52,289
to be a liquid then it would be a

1502
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,079
product of nature wouldn't even be

1503
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:58,050
patentable but the judge was persuaded

1504
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:59,539
by this by this argument instead that

1505
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:01,740
rather than being an actual liquid

1506
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:04,019
according to the dictionary definition

1507
01:04:01,739 --> 01:04:05,939
of liquids it was more of a soft solid

1508
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:07,530
and therefore that what is claimed is

1509
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:11,880
not a product to make sure it has been

1510
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:15,420
altered by by human interaction so that

1511
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:18,119
that was that hit the news wires as some

1512
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:19,920
kind of a defeat for pure hemp and kind

1513
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:21,900
of a strengthening of you cans position

1514
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,820
but I actually wrote a blog about that

1515
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:27,630
one as well and just said this is no big

1516
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:29,880
deal finding refusing to find invalidity

1517
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,710
on this particular point is not a

1518
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,480
finding of validity of the patent

1519
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:35,519
it's just a finding that that this

1520
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:39,240
particular theory that could be advanced

1521
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:42,239
at this stage wasn't successful but what

1522
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:44,279
we're likely to see is as they get

1523
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,769
further into the the process of

1524
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,900
producing evidence and so on if the

1525
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:51,568
parties don't settle if it actually does

1526
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,220
go to trial then pure hemp collective

1527
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:55,259
will put all this evidence in front of a

1528
01:04:53,219 --> 01:04:56,818
jury or in front of the judge I don't

1529
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,260
remember if they've demanded a jury

1530
01:04:56,818 --> 01:05:00,480
trial or if this is something that the

1531
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:03,089
judge will handle but either way the

1532
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,190
evidence will be considered and if if

1533
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:07,380
what appears to be abundant evidence

1534
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:08,818
that there were plenty of liquid

1535
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,519
formulations they're only even even has

1536
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:13,289
to be one but if there are if there is

1537
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:14,880
even one liquid formulation that falls

1538
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:17,009
within the scope of these claims that

1539
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,680
predated the patent then these claims

1540
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:22,859
will be ruled invalid all right so the

1541
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,719
idea that if if it goes to trial is

1542
01:05:22,858 --> 01:05:27,799
really interesting because we have been

1543
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:33,799
seeing all over the cannabis industry

1544
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:37,579
these big well-funded in capitalized

1545
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:41,849
behemoths in the industry coming in and

1546
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:44,430
pushing on trademarks and and on product

1547
01:05:41,849 --> 01:05:47,490
product patents with these smaller

1548
01:05:44,429 --> 01:05:50,039
players who just simply don't have the

1549
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:51,449
kind of deep pockets that it takes to

1550
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:55,108
defend themselves

1551
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:57,899
with somebody with highly paid lawyers

1552
01:05:55,108 --> 01:06:01,858
that can go a long time so what are we

1553
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:04,318
seeing in the moment as far as as the

1554
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:07,250
hemp folks being able to even garner

1555
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:10,980
their resources to present a defense

1556
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:12,809
well that is a good question and I can

1557
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:15,298
tell you I've looked at the court papers

1558
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:17,430
I did that in in preparation for another

1559
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:19,409
talk I was giving and I looked in quite

1560
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:23,509
a bit of detail and they they do seem to

1561
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:26,969
have good representation that is doing a

1562
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:29,069
thorough job of the defense I don't know

1563
01:06:26,969 --> 01:06:30,929
how they're funded I hope that there are

1564
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:32,159
people that are coming to their defense

1565
01:06:30,929 --> 01:06:34,348
if they need it they may have had

1566
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,379
litigation insurance so I don't actually

1567
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:41,880
know how they're affording the defense

1568
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:44,670
they have and I I think if they ever

1569
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,369
seem to be running low and need some

1570
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:47,530
help they're proud

1571
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:49,929
people that would volunteer to step up

1572
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:52,480
and help them because everyone benefits

1573
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:54,819
if if it is true that this patent is

1574
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,039
over broad and invalid and again I'm

1575
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,539
trying to be more objective about that

1576
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,239
and because I haven't looked at the

1577
01:06:58,539 --> 01:07:02,559
evidence myself but if it is true that

1578
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:04,179
there is that kind of evidence and that

1579
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,699
this patent is invalid then having it

1580
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:09,759
invalidated really benefits everyone

1581
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:11,769
because then no one will be will be

1582
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,270
getting a letter saying you need to take

1583
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:15,009
a license to our patent or you need to

1584
01:07:13,269 --> 01:07:16,719
stop selling your product that would be

1585
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:21,010
a public benefit yeah it sounds like a

1586
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:23,619
good reason for a GoFundMe so so how

1587
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:24,760
long do we expect this to play out is

1588
01:07:23,619 --> 01:07:26,980
this something that's going to be

1589
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,330
kicking around for a decade or is this

1590
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,070
something that's you know gonna be

1591
01:07:28,329 --> 01:07:32,789
pretty aggressive and we'll be wrapping

1592
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:35,680
up here in the next you know year or two

1593
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:38,409
well I have no litigation expert usually

1594
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:40,869
what I do is is transactions relating to

1595
01:07:38,409 --> 01:07:43,089
IP and helping people get patents I've

1596
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:45,579
I've walked some clients through

1597
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:46,950
litigation and so I know about how

1598
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:51,009
litigation works from that perspective

1599
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:53,259
but I my general sense is that different

1600
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:55,150
judges set different pace different

1601
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,480
kinds of pace for the cases they handle

1602
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:59,410
and that the pace of this case will be

1603
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,619
somewhat up to the judge and then

1604
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:04,179
somewhat up to the time required to

1605
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:06,489
gather the evidence in discovery and

1606
01:08:04,179 --> 01:08:08,049
then the parties if they're negotiating

1607
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:11,109
some kind of a settlement they may

1608
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:13,450
request some kind of a continuance to to

1609
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:16,000
settle the case but I would expect that

1610
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:17,319
this if it goes all the way to trial it

1611
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,600
could drive on for another year or two

1612
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:20,859
all right I don't know that before the

1613
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,690
authoritative lis though yeah right I

1614
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:24,159
just just something for us to go with

1615
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:26,619
right so that we can all have a better

1616
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:28,539
understanding so all right so before we

1617
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:29,590
go to our second commercial you said

1618
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,970
something and I didn't want to interrupt

1619
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:33,900
your flow a while back but I thought I

1620
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:37,750
think it's very important to note that

1621
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:44,710
the fact that there is not a rich

1622
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:46,630
library of cannabis information make is

1623
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:48,369
showing proof of products that have been

1624
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:50,230
in the market how long they were in the

1625
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:51,550
market what the packaging looked like

1626
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:53,739
what their claims on the packaging was

1627
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:55,420
their analytics there's this big void

1628
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:57,909
and you said something interesting you

1629
01:08:55,420 --> 01:09:01,960
said you know this Kree

1630
01:08:57,909 --> 01:09:05,619
it's a sense of you know a lack of

1631
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:09,520
knowingness that is probably going to go

1632
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:12,099
forward a generation as the old evidence

1633
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,920
comes out of the shadows wherever it may

1634
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:18,280
be and if there's not evidence in the

1635
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:21,399
past the new body of work that is

1636
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:24,219
happening now with decreasing

1637
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:26,589
prohibition as it fills in the holes and

1638
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:29,380
like a generation later will have this

1639
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:32,770
stuff you know decided better for worse

1640
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:34,659
but you know yeah I spent most of my

1641
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:37,150
life as a business strategist and that

1642
01:09:34,659 --> 01:09:41,109
sends up huge red flags for me because

1643
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:43,299
so many of these businesses that are you

1644
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:46,599
know getting high-level capital

1645
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:48,699
investment and our you know IP owing as

1646
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:52,060
part of their value package they're

1647
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:54,789
claiming IP and this IP is not settled

1648
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:56,620
and what this tells me is that I love

1649
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:59,229
here on your laughing what this tells me

1650
01:09:56,619 --> 01:10:01,779
is that these these value claims of

1651
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:05,079
these companies will be in question for

1652
01:10:01,779 --> 01:10:10,679
a while and wildly increasing the risk

1653
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:14,829
that these companies need to overcome I

1654
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:17,289
think that's true although it's not I

1655
01:10:14,829 --> 01:10:20,260
would say that it's it's more true in

1656
01:10:17,289 --> 01:10:23,140
some fields than others if you're

1657
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:25,750
claiming something that that has the

1658
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:28,570
technology to have been around for a

1659
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:31,989
long time and just isn't documented

1660
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:34,719
you've got to really be suspicious about

1661
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:37,239
whether that patent is valid so you know

1662
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,670
something as technologically friendly is

1663
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:41,769
can you make a liquid formulation that's

1664
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:43,210
not that's not very new so liquid

1665
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:45,370
formulations have clearly been around

1666
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:47,170
for a long time and it makes you wonder

1667
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:50,170
have these particular liquid

1668
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:52,119
formulations can are they how likely are

1669
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:55,380
they to be new in other situations so

1670
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:57,340
you know there are really new

1671
01:10:55,380 --> 01:11:00,039
fundamental technologies that are being

1672
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:03,039
applied to cannabis and it's very

1673
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:05,019
unlikely that some new like let's I'm

1674
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:06,220
not advocating genetic engineering but

1675
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,500
let's talk about there's there's

1676
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:10,900
something called CRISPR which is a

1677
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,738
technology the less people edit genes in

1678
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:14,379
and live

1679
01:11:11,738 --> 01:11:15,819
organisms and change the genetic

1680
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:18,730
expression without actually putting in

1681
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:21,009
any foreign genes and so if you have a

1682
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:23,018
technology that's as new as CRISPR and

1683
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:26,199
you have patent claims that are directed

1684
01:11:23,019 --> 01:11:29,289
to some new beneficial use of cannabis

1685
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:31,868
that involves that then you could as you

1686
01:11:29,288 --> 01:11:35,529
could safely assume that you wouldn't

1687
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:37,748
need a long old history of prior art

1688
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:39,698
going back a few decades to establish

1689
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:42,099
whether that was patentable or not you'd

1690
01:11:39,698 --> 01:11:45,879
have less of a likelihood that that

1691
01:11:42,099 --> 01:11:48,130
existed in a in a in a previous industry

1692
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,498
that was kept in the shadows so it is a

1693
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:53,139
function of what kind of invention it is

1694
01:11:50,498 --> 01:11:55,630
that would it would give you more or

1695
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:57,519
less confidence about the the strength

1696
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:58,659
of someone's patents and there's just

1697
01:11:57,519 --> 01:12:01,659
one other thing I want to say about

1698
01:11:58,658 --> 01:12:05,529
utility patents because these two

1699
01:12:01,658 --> 01:12:07,839
patents are so far out there and incite

1700
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:09,550
such an emotional reaction in a Hana

1701
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:13,059
what the hell kind of reaction from

1702
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:17,380
people it has it has kind of created a

1703
01:12:13,059 --> 01:12:22,210
bad name for all utility patents and if

1704
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:24,969
you if you have a cultivar of cannabis

1705
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:26,679
that you bred yourself and that is

1706
01:12:24,969 --> 01:12:28,658
special and it can do some great things

1707
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:31,029
and you know you originated it and

1708
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:32,288
you're trying to get utility protection

1709
01:12:31,029 --> 01:12:33,849
just so you can protect the seeds

1710
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:36,399
because that's the only way to protect

1711
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:39,130
your seeds if it's a high THC cannabis a

1712
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,629
plant patent isn't available plant

1713
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:42,340
variety protection certificate isn't

1714
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:47,469
available so it's a utility patent or

1715
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:50,889
nothing hating on people who get utility

1716
01:12:47,469 --> 01:12:52,989
patents of any sort is I think that's a

1717
01:12:50,889 --> 01:12:57,219
gross over interpretation of the problem

1718
01:12:52,988 --> 01:13:00,928
I would liken these two patents to you

1719
01:12:57,219 --> 01:13:04,118
know 18-wheelers with 30-foot trailers

1720
01:13:00,929 --> 01:13:07,868
rumbling down a school zone at 90 miles

1721
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:09,929
an hour and if you don't like that that

1722
01:13:07,868 --> 01:13:11,948
doesn't mean that you can't like someone

1723
01:13:09,929 --> 01:13:14,828
riding their bike through the school

1724
01:13:11,948 --> 01:13:16,658
zone or driving a normal car at 25 miles

1725
01:13:14,828 --> 01:13:17,979
an hour in the school zone just because

1726
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:19,328
they're all motor vehicles doesn't mean

1727
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:21,569
they're all doing the same thing doesn't

1728
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:24,488
mean they all pose the same threat and

1729
01:13:21,569 --> 01:13:25,658
sometimes a utility patent is the only

1730
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:27,879
tool available to

1731
01:13:25,658 --> 01:13:29,529
one who just wants to protect what they

1732
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:31,210
actually created within a normal

1733
01:13:29,529 --> 01:13:34,059
appropriate scope that isn't

1734
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:35,920
overreaching and because these utility

1735
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:37,870
patents have so offended people in the

1736
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,750
industry there is I think a real

1737
01:13:37,869 --> 01:13:42,698
backlash against what I would call very

1738
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:45,389
appropriate and necessary utility

1739
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:48,579
patents well yeah that's for sure I mean

1740
01:13:45,389 --> 01:13:50,560
I'm a big fan of open source nearly

1741
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:52,630
everything but it wasn't until I

1742
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,989
interviewed Reggie Godinho on an earlier

1743
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:57,850
episode that I realized that open source

1744
01:13:55,988 --> 01:14:01,178
is a good place to come from in the

1745
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:03,969
heart but we need these Pat we need good

1746
01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:06,760
people to get patents and exert their

1747
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:08,770
patents just so that we can defend the

1748
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:11,800
heart of cannabis so it isn't all owned

1749
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:13,630
by folks who don't want to use it in the

1750
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,219
same way that that those of us who've

1751
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:17,800
been in the family for a long time want

1752
01:14:15,219 --> 01:14:21,069
it to be used I would agree with that

1753
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,480
yeah so all right so so let's go ahead

1754
01:14:21,069 --> 01:14:24,579
and take our second break and when we

1755
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:27,968
come back we're gonna talk about some

1756
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:30,630
real brass tacks about how folks who are

1757
01:14:27,969 --> 01:14:33,369
are breeding and developing plant lines

1758
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:37,420
can play a little defense against these

1759
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:39,039
types of patents and and stick there you

1760
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,899
know draw their line in their stands so

1761
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:41,619
you are listening to shaping fire I'm

1762
01:14:40,899 --> 01:14:43,388
your host

1763
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:45,609
Shengo Louis and our guest this week is

1764
01:14:43,389 --> 01:14:48,880
plant scientist and patent attorney Dale

1765
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:50,649
hunt this message is for folks who grow

1766
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,139
cannabis I'm talking to home growers

1767
01:14:50,649 --> 01:14:55,509
patients and commercial growers too I'm

1768
01:14:53,139 --> 01:14:57,369
probably talking to you when you plan

1769
01:14:55,510 --> 01:15:01,270
out your next growing cycle be sure to

1770
01:14:57,369 --> 01:15:02,229
check out Humble CSI seeds at Humble CSI

1771

1772
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:05,919
Kaleb Inspectah and his family have

1773
01:15:04,448 --> 01:15:08,229
lived in Humboldt County for over a

1774
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,179
hundred years for the last 40 years

1775
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:12,250
three generations of his family have

1776
01:15:10,179 --> 01:15:14,230
cultivated extraordinary sensimilla

1777
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:17,289
cannabis in Humboldt Mendocino and

1778
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:19,149
Trinity counties because of his lineage

1779
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:21,158
and the hard earned experience that

1780
01:15:19,149 --> 01:15:23,198
comes from growing up smoking and

1781
01:15:21,158 --> 01:15:24,429
sifting large populations of cannabis

1782
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:27,009
plants in Northern California

1783
01:15:24,429 --> 01:15:29,350
the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be

1784
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:31,719
winning genetics based on long time

1785
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:33,610
heavy hitters and updated Andrus if

1786
01:15:31,719 --> 01:15:35,800
today bring out new and exotic traits

1787
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:38,529
and better yields go ahead and ask

1788
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:40,538
around Caleb also known as inspect

1789
01:15:38,529 --> 01:15:43,149
and pirates of the Emerald triangle is a

1790
01:15:40,538 --> 01:15:44,529
breeders breeder he reaches way back and

1791
01:15:43,149 --> 01:15:46,658
works with significant strains

1792
01:15:44,529 --> 01:15:48,670
recreating them in new and interesting

Shengo Lowe's and our guest this week is

1865
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:23,750
plant scientist and patent attorney Dale

1866
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,529
hunt so Dale now that we've scared the

1867
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,720
hell out of everybody

1868
01:18:24,529 --> 01:18:28,789
during the first two sets let's then

1869
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,119
bring this on home right because one of

1870
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:33,529
the things that I appreciate about

1871
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:36,019
chatting with you is that you're

1872
01:18:33,529 --> 01:18:39,069
constantly looking for solutions for

1873
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:42,260
these challenges for breeders because

1874
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:44,239
you know the more I read your blogs and

1875
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,460
talk to you about the kinds of things

1876
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:49,340
that interest you you know I can't be

1877
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:52,789
the first person to recognize that you

1878
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:56,180
have you have made a bit of a path from

1879
01:18:52,789 --> 01:18:58,430
being a straight up you know patent

1880
01:18:56,180 --> 01:19:01,100
attorney to actually being a bit of a

1881
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:03,619
cannabis activist it's pretty obvious

1882
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:05,750
what side of this that you are on while

1883
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:07,880
you know remaining clear-headed and

1884
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:11,119
neutral but I enjoy talking to you the

1885
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:13,579
other day about you know what strategies

1886
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:17,840
are that you recommend for people

1887
01:19:13,579 --> 01:19:20,239
developing you know clonally chemo VARs

1888
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,739
and seed sets to protect what they've

1889
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:24,079
got going on because you know clearly

1890
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:27,559
everybody cares a lot more about this

1891
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:29,840
since the Philo's mess and people don't

1892
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:31,070
really have solutions and you know from

1893
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,569
show to show I mean we talk about

1894
01:19:31,069 --> 01:19:34,670
patents pretty regularly on this show

1895
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:37,519
and and everybody kind of comes to the

1896
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:39,800
same point of you know we don't know how

1897
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,980
this is gonna play out yet there are no

1898
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:46,100
clean right answers because everything

1899
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:48,049
is in play but the you will hold this

1900
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,810
unique see where you are a plant

1901
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:53,150
scientists and also patent attorney

1902
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:55,370
where you can kind of see the state of

1903
01:19:53,149 --> 01:19:58,210
play and say alright we don't know how

1904
01:19:55,369 --> 01:20:02,090
this is gonna play out but the best

1905
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:03,380
defenses that we can do today are ABC

1906
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,970
and that's what I want to talk about

1907
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:07,190
because a lot of folks that are listed

1908
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:09,440
they're putting their life's work you

1909
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:10,609
know out into the world and and they and

1910
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:11,929
they don't want to get skunked they

1911
01:20:10,609 --> 01:20:13,519
especially don't want to be skunked by

1912
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:15,829
people don't have that don't have the

1913
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,780
same heart that they have so so talking

1914
01:20:15,829 --> 01:20:19,100
specifically about plant genetics and

1915
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:21,710
breeders wanting to protect their

1916
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:24,220
creations what are the present best

1917
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:28,489
protections available for these folks

1918
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:31,579
well one of the protections is actually

1919
01:20:28,489 --> 01:20:34,279
free and I and I wrote a blog about it I

1920
01:20:31,579 --> 01:20:37,250
look up on plant law comm and look for

1921
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:38,719
the picture of grapes and I don't really

1922
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,729
remember the title of blog something

1923
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:46,340
about protection from furrier IP that is

1924
01:20:40,729 --> 01:20:47,929
free and never expires and unfortunately

1925
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:50,900
it only helps with it only works with

1926
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:53,180
one business strategy and that is let's

1927
01:20:50,899 --> 01:20:54,859
suppose you have a cultivar that you've

1928
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:58,940
developed in and you love it and it's

1929
01:20:54,859 --> 01:21:01,099
fantastic and but you either can't

1930
01:20:58,939 --> 01:21:02,359
afford a patent or you just don't want

1931
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:04,610
to go there

1932
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:08,539
if your so if all you're selling is

1933
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:13,789
flower and you're never going to sell a

1934
01:21:08,539 --> 01:21:16,039
clone then you can sell you can then

1935
01:21:13,789 --> 01:21:17,989
that the challenge you have is to just

1936
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:20,029
control whoever gets access to your

1937
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:21,800
propagating material you can sell

1938
01:21:20,029 --> 01:21:26,239
harvested material all day long it's

1939
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:28,750
dried its cured and no one can replicate

1940
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:32,149
your clone from the harvested material

1941
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:34,159
if you control all the cloning and

1942
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:35,449
control where all those clones go and

1943
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,760
who grows them and you've got good

1944
01:21:35,449 --> 01:21:40,340
agreements to govern all of that then

1945
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:43,640
you might not need a patent the bad news

1946
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:46,520
of that is that even getting those good

1947
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:48,200
agreements in place with people is going

1948
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,640
to cost some money and then there's

1949
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:52,069
still some trust involved and some

1950
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:56,930
challenges when you have to trust other

1951
01:21:52,069 --> 01:22:01,039
people and that's why people even even

1952
01:21:56,930 --> 01:22:02,270
big companies that control when I talk

1953
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:04,909
about big companies I'm talking about

1954
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:08,510
like my grape clients and my my

1955
01:22:04,909 --> 01:22:10,099
blueberry clients they don't let any of

1956
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:12,079
their genetics out of their hands

1957
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:13,970
they're vertically integrated but they

1958
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:15,979
still get patents because if it does

1959
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,840
slip out and they can't there's it's

1960
01:22:15,979 --> 01:22:18,859
impossible to have a big organization a

1961
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,050
big operation

1962
01:22:18,859 --> 01:22:24,589
and still have perfect security if

1963
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:26,539
anything does slip out they and ends up

1964
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:28,929
in the market they need to be able to

1965
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:31,399
have some recourse against whoever is

1966
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:35,420
using their genetics without their

1967
01:22:31,399 --> 01:22:37,969
authorization and if that's not someone

1968
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:39,139
you made it a made a contract with then

1969
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:42,679
you can't sue them for breach of

1970
01:22:39,139 --> 01:22:44,359
contract and unless they're the ones

1971
01:22:42,679 --> 01:22:45,920
that stole it and you can prove they

1972
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:48,349
stole it you can't go after them for

1973
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,730
theft but you can always go after them

1974
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:51,829
for patent infringement if they're

1975
01:22:49,729 --> 01:22:54,859
propagating your plants without your

1976
01:22:51,829 --> 01:22:57,889
permission and you can prove the patent

1977
01:22:54,859 --> 01:22:59,118
infringement with a DNA test that gives

1978
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:00,590
me an opportunity to say one thing about

1979
01:22:59,118 --> 01:23:03,259
DNA a lot of people think you have to

1980
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:05,810
have a full DNA sequence or a DNA map or

1981
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:08,090
something to apply for a plant patent

1982
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:12,199
it's not true I wrote so wrote a blog

1983
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:14,179
about that and I think it's titled

1984
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:16,460
something like none that's how much DNA

1985
01:23:14,179 --> 01:23:18,679
you need - how much DNA information you

1986
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:22,100
need to apply for a plant patent I've

1987
01:23:18,679 --> 01:23:23,779
obtained counting international ones

1988
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,520
I've obtained thousands of plant patents

1989
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:29,658
for my clients and we've never submitted

1990
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:33,440
DNA now on the other hand the first time

1991
01:23:29,658 --> 01:23:35,539
we had to prove infringement in a really

1992
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:38,238
contested case and with these grapes

1993
01:23:35,539 --> 01:23:39,920
that I've worked with we got a DNA test

1994
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:42,198
right away for that because that was the

1995
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,000
way to prove infringement and the point

1996
01:23:42,198 --> 01:23:46,519
is that you can always go get the DNA

1997
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,899
evidence it can be helpful to have it in

1998
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,699
advance because then you don't have to

1999
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:52,429
show a chain of custody and everything

2000
01:23:49,698 --> 01:23:54,109
you could say this is the same DNA test

2001
01:23:52,429 --> 01:23:56,840
that we submitted in our patent

2002
01:23:54,109 --> 01:23:59,750
application and our queue this accused

2003
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:03,199
plant matches it completely and so it's

2004
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:05,420
clearly infringing but you don't have to

2005
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:06,829
have that DNA evidence to to to get the

2006
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,569
patent in the first place and then you

2007
01:24:06,829 --> 01:24:12,109
just you just basically do a comparison

2008
01:24:08,569 --> 01:24:13,759
of your patented cultivar and the

2009
01:24:12,109 --> 01:24:18,039
accused cultivar and the DNA will make

2010
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:21,340
it open and shut so that's why even

2011
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:23,929
though people can have a viable business

2012
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:24,710
just based on agreements and on high

2013
01:24:23,929 --> 01:24:26,719
security

2014
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:28,609
some people that have good agreements

2015
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,319
and also have high security still choose

2016
01:24:28,609 --> 01:24:32,239
to patent what they have because it

2017
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:34,369
gives them recourse a different

2018
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:36,979
kind of legal recourse against people

2019
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:39,050
who end up coming in and using their

2020
01:24:36,979 --> 01:24:40,459
stuff without permission and just you

2021
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,750
know you don't have to prove theft you

2022
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:43,699
don't have to prove a breach of contract

2023
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:45,800
you just can prove that that they don't

2024
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:47,449
have a right to that they're using your

2025
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:53,420
plants and without your permission

2026
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:56,179
oh so got it so so if that is the if

2027
01:24:53,420 --> 01:25:01,340
that is the business model that is most

2028
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:04,250
easily protected it's also like one of

2029
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:05,690
the least common in in the scene right

2030
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:09,380
now right folks who are growing their

2031
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:10,969
own cultivar and are the exclusive

2032
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:13,250
people bringing out on the market

2033
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:15,170
certainly they exist but certainly

2034
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:17,449
there's a hell of a lot more people who

2035
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:18,680
are bringing seeds to market and that's

2036
01:25:17,449 --> 01:25:21,289
probably gonna be the bulk of people's

2037
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:23,510
concerns so let's wait into that all

2038
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:26,029
right I'm glad you asked about that

2039
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:28,239
because that's when your choices are

2040
01:25:26,029 --> 01:25:30,409
really different if you are

2041
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:33,679
commercializing seeds or selling seeds

2042
01:25:30,409 --> 01:25:36,680
or or anything except except harvested

2043
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:38,360
except flower and you want any kind of

2044
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:41,450
intellectual property protection your

2045
01:25:38,359 --> 01:25:43,729
you really do have to either go with a

2046
01:25:41,449 --> 01:25:45,949
utility patent to protect the seed to

2047
01:25:43,729 --> 01:25:47,809
have claims that protect the seeds or if

2048
01:25:45,949 --> 01:25:49,729
it happens to be industrial hemp you can

2049
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:52,280
go through the USDA plant variety

2050
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:57,439
protection system but in any of those

2051
01:25:52,279 --> 01:26:00,889
cases you still have to have McGuirk

2052
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:03,799
perfect flawless control over your

2053
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:06,400
plants and what's done with them or you

2054
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:08,570
have to have some kind of some kind of

2055
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:10,129
contracts or you have to have some kind

2056
01:26:08,569 --> 01:26:12,500
of intellectual property recourse and

2057
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:14,329
the problem is you can't exercise that

2058
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,739
flawless control over your genetics if

2059
01:26:14,329 --> 01:26:16,729
you're selling seeds that's that's the

2060
01:26:15,739 --> 01:26:21,229
whole point is you're putting them out

2061
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:23,869
there and so in this case if you want to

2062
01:26:21,229 --> 01:26:27,229
be selling seeds you're either going to

2063
01:26:23,869 --> 01:26:31,279
have people growing those seeds without

2064
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:33,319
permission or you're going to be able to

2065
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,329
get a patent on on your seeds and at

2066
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:36,859
least restrict you know they can buy

2067
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:38,689
your seeds they can grow your seeds but

2068
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:41,149
they can't use them for their own

2069
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:43,250
breeding and that's a hot button because

2070
01:26:41,149 --> 01:26:46,179
a lot of people really believe in the

2071
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:48,969
importance of open source can

2072
01:26:46,179 --> 01:26:50,679
was breeding and I'm I'm someone that

2073
01:26:48,969 --> 01:26:51,849
supports that not notwithstanding the

2074
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:54,399
fact that I'm a patent attorney I

2075
01:26:51,849 --> 01:26:56,050
recognize that the industry itself in

2076
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:58,299
the community is very passionate about

2077
01:26:56,050 --> 01:27:00,788
sharing genetic resources it's been a

2078
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:02,769
kind of an ethic within the industry for

2079
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:04,809
a long time and those people who want to

2080
01:27:02,769 --> 01:27:06,998
do that it's not for everyone but people

2081
01:27:04,809 --> 01:27:10,630
who want to do that should be able to do

2082
01:27:06,998 --> 01:27:13,538
it and I I I caused a little bit of a

2083
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:15,958
stir by writing a blog that is says why

2084
01:27:13,538 --> 01:27:20,819
open-source cannabis doesn't work and

2085
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:23,529
how to fix it and so I definitely have a

2086
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:25,478
and an illegal analysis behind that

2087
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:28,809
right now

2088
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:32,760
so so let's let's let's get very

2089
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:36,369
specific so let's say that I am a seed

2090
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:38,229
maker and I'm breeding unique cultivars

2091
01:27:36,368 --> 01:27:39,339
or at least ones that I consider unique

2092
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:41,800
we'll have to talk whether or not

2093
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:44,920
they're unique legally or not and I want

2094
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:48,130
to put my seeds out and I I want to be

2095
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:51,399
the only person that can sell seeds that

2096
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:53,380
have got my name on it and and no one

2097
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:55,348
else should be able to breed with my

2098
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:57,969
seed stock unless I give them permission

2099
01:27:55,349 --> 01:28:01,050
I'm guessing from the rest of the show

2100
01:27:57,969 --> 01:28:03,639
today that that's actually a pretty high

2101
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:05,429
high level of difficult to just secure

2102
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:08,260
that but let's hear what you have to say

2103
01:28:05,429 --> 01:28:11,618
well it doesn't have to be difficult if

2104
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:13,329
you are if you're focused on if you're

2105
01:28:11,618 --> 01:28:15,670
if you're willing to pursue a utility

2106
01:28:13,328 --> 01:28:17,590
patent that isn't one of these over

2107
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:20,019
broad 18 wheelers barreling down the

2108
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:22,239
school zone it's it's a it's a nice

2109
01:28:20,019 --> 01:28:23,829
friendly Subaru or something going 25

2110
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:27,129
miles an hour it's an appropriate

2111
01:28:23,828 --> 01:28:30,099
vehicle for protecting your invention

2112
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:33,069
that you limit your claims to the

2113
01:28:30,099 --> 01:28:35,800
specific cultivar that you placed on

2114
01:28:33,069 --> 01:28:38,349
deposit which would be a seed sample and

2115
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,150
you say I'm claiming seeds related to

2116
01:28:38,349 --> 01:28:42,760
these seeds seeds they're the same

2117
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:44,198
progeny of the same cultivar as the

2118
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,639
seeds that are on deposit I'm not

2119
01:28:44,198 --> 01:28:48,219
claiming anything else I'm not using

2120
01:28:45,639 --> 01:28:50,739
those just as an example of what else as

2121
01:28:48,219 --> 01:28:53,260
an example of something typical of my

2122
01:28:50,738 --> 01:28:55,538
claim that is what I'm claiming so first

2123
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:56,920
of all that's a modest request it's a

2124
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:58,688
modest scope of protection you're only

2125
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,078
protecting the thing that you invented

2126
01:28:58,689 --> 01:29:02,000
not other things pea

2127
01:29:00,078 --> 01:29:05,238
that not things that other people might

2128
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,578
someday invent and if you do that

2129
01:29:05,238 --> 01:29:10,939
through utility patent then you can you

2130
01:29:07,578 --> 01:29:13,488
can get claims to seeds that are progeny

2131
01:29:10,939 --> 01:29:15,828
of the of the plant of the plant

2132
01:29:13,488 --> 01:29:18,618
cultivar that's on deposit you can claim

2133
01:29:15,828 --> 01:29:21,408
a method of breeding cannabis involving

2134
01:29:18,618 --> 01:29:23,779
crossing one of those one of your

2135
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:25,609
cultivar with something else and so if

2136
01:29:23,779 --> 01:29:28,130
you do want to be able to maintain that

2137
01:29:25,609 --> 01:29:30,589
kind of exclusivity and you don't want

2138
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:33,409
to be in more of an open-source model

2139
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:37,279
then then utility protection isn't

2140
01:29:33,408 --> 01:29:39,710
actually it's not inaccessible and it's

2141
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:41,529
not it's not an overreach that's that's

2142
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:45,948
the only available way really to protect

2143
01:29:41,529 --> 01:29:48,050
your seeds if they have over 0.3% THC

2144
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:50,269
well if they make plants that do that so

2145
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:53,179
I understand how that works downstream

2146
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:56,389
from me if I was the breeder but how

2147
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:58,578
does that work upstream so you know just

2148
01:29:56,389 --> 01:30:00,770
about nothing out there to breed with as

2149
01:29:58,578 --> 01:30:03,710
a land race anymore right you know most

2150
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:05,659
breeders are not going you know into

2151
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:07,760
these like original heritage countries

2152
01:30:05,658 --> 01:30:09,828
and bringing back seeds so let's say

2153
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,920
that let's say I'm a breeder and I'm

2154
01:30:09,828 --> 01:30:15,049
going to cross you know one seed that I

2155
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:17,809
bought from one breeder and another seed

2156
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:20,779
from another breeder and I'm gonna cross

2157
01:30:17,809 --> 01:30:23,480
those and I'm gonna make a whole bunch

2158
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:26,689
of seeds and then let's say i do a sift

2159
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:30,769
of a hundred of them and i find my

2160
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:33,138
favorite to like how far away from the

2161
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:36,079
original two seeds do I need to get

2162
01:30:33,139 --> 01:30:38,029
before I can patent it do I have to do I

2163
01:30:36,078 --> 01:30:40,549
have to do something novel to them or

2164
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:42,019
can I just take any two in Kaikohe just

2165
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:44,900
cross the Mac one two anything I'm like

2166
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:47,389
boom I want to patent this well well I

2167
01:30:44,899 --> 01:30:50,388
could or not that this the standard for

2168
01:30:47,389 --> 01:30:53,929
novelty when it comes to patents and

2169
01:30:50,389 --> 01:30:55,849
plant genetics is really low if it's if

2170
01:30:53,929 --> 01:30:59,000
you're trying to patent a cultivar you

2171
01:30:55,849 --> 01:31:00,828
just have to show that it's new if your

2172
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,078
if your patent claim is limited to that

2173
01:31:00,828 --> 01:31:04,969
cultivar it's it's impossible for one

2174
01:31:03,078 --> 01:31:07,969
cultivar to be obvious over another one

2175
01:31:04,969 --> 01:31:10,819
it's legally not possible and so it's

2176
01:31:07,969 --> 01:31:13,640
really all about the novelty and if you

2177
01:31:10,819 --> 01:31:15,529
think about the novelty re

2178
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:19,130
and this this sounds crazy but it really

2179
01:31:15,529 --> 01:31:22,340
is true every single seed ever formed in

2180
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:24,109
a cross is new and different from every

2181
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:25,730
other seed genetically if you think

2182
01:31:24,109 --> 01:31:28,699
about all of the genes that get shuffled

2183
01:31:25,729 --> 01:31:30,709
in a sexual cross that results in seeds

2184
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:33,739
there are no two that end up being

2185
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:34,880
genetically identical yeah that's true I

2186
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:38,029
mean we've got all these different fee

2187
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:42,949
knows and and so so would it be based on

2188
01:31:38,029 --> 01:31:45,710
the short read of the genotype or of the

2189
01:31:42,949 --> 01:31:48,319
genome instead of how it expresses

2190
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:49,489
itself as a you know in any particular

2191
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:52,460
environment Russ yeah I'm just thinking

2192
01:31:49,489 --> 01:31:55,460
out loud so so what I'm what I'm hearing

2193
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:57,550
here is that I can take any two seeds

2194
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:59,840
and if they are not already patented

2195
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:02,420
that you're not allowed to breed with

2196
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:05,000
them I can take any two seeds and cross

2197
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:07,220
them at this state of the industry and

2198
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,460
suddenly I've got a not novel keema var

2199
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:14,600
and I can patent it yes and one of the

2200
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:17,840
blogs on plant law calm is it answered

2201
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,400
the title is how can I tell if my strain

2202
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,989
I think I use the word strain there how

2203
01:32:19,399 --> 01:32:23,509
can I tell if my strain is new and

2204
01:32:20,989 --> 01:32:26,510
different enough for patenting and my

2205
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:28,760
answer to that in the blog is if you

2206
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:31,570
made it and it's a new it's a new result

2207
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:33,650
of a sexual cross it's by definition

2208
01:32:31,569 --> 01:32:35,869
different and distinct enough for

2209
01:32:33,649 --> 01:32:37,519
patenting and you know that it's new the

2210
01:32:35,869 --> 01:32:40,729
question is always going to just be is

2211
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,230
it worth patenting many things that you

2212
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:44,479
produce are not going to be you know if

2213
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:47,569
you do a cross you'll have thousands of

2214
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:49,099
seeds you'll grow many of those out and

2215
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:52,009
decide which ones have the phenotype

2216
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:53,780
that you want and then you'll save if

2217
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:56,150
you know a small handful of those is

2218
01:32:53,779 --> 01:32:57,649
your special results of that cross and

2219
01:32:56,149 --> 01:32:58,969
you may do some more crossing in some

2220
01:32:57,649 --> 01:33:00,829
more selection but when you finally have

2221
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:03,710
something that you think is going to

2222
01:33:00,829 --> 01:33:06,619
have commercial value for years that's

2223
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:07,850
when you think about patenting it and if

2224
01:33:06,619 --> 01:33:10,010
you think it's going to have commercial

2225
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:11,660
value for years then you know you're

2226
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:13,070
going to grow that plant you're going to

2227
01:33:11,659 --> 01:33:15,710
do some back crossing you're going to

2228
01:33:13,069 --> 01:33:17,449
try to stabilize the seed line as much

2229
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:20,600
as you can try to get it as homozygous

2230
01:33:17,449 --> 01:33:22,519
as you can without losing all the traits

2231
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:25,370
that you're after and when you have a

2232
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:27,490
stable seed line that's probably when

2233
01:33:25,369 --> 01:33:29,470
that's what you would probably want

2234
01:33:27,489 --> 01:33:31,269
to try to commercialize and that's

2235
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:35,530
probably the appropriate time to try to

2236
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:36,970
patent it and that is you know you are

2237
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:39,399
going to if you're doing seeds you do

2238
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:42,030
need to be able to say that the seeds of

2239
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:44,049
this particular cultivar are

2240
01:33:42,029 --> 01:33:45,759
substantially say it's stable and that

2241
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:47,800
they're substantially true to type and

2242
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,449
so you know if you have a segregating

2243
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:52,900
population that wouldn't even count as a

2244
01:33:49,449 --> 01:33:55,300
as a cultivar per se but but the real

2245
01:33:52,899 --> 01:33:58,210
question of is it new it's it's new

2246
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:01,150
because every sexual cross is new it you

2247
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:02,859
know and and is it distinct even you and

2248
01:34:01,149 --> 01:34:04,269
your siblings are different from each

2249
01:34:02,859 --> 01:34:06,099
other even though you came from the same

2250
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:08,560
parents and it's the same with every

2251
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:13,630
seat okay

2252
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:17,289
um but going into the future as utility

2253
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:20,130
patents on seeds become more common the

2254
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:24,460
the breeder is going to also have to ask

2255
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:27,489
does does the original breeder of this

2256
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:29,920
seed that I'm crossing already have an

2257
01:34:27,489 --> 01:34:31,929
existing utility patent on it which

2258
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,750
would restrict me from breeding it right

2259
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:36,550
that's right okay of course if they want

2260
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:38,439
to assert their rights they need to

2261
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:40,690
label their product and so if someone is

2262
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:43,269
selling patented seed there would be a

2263
01:34:40,689 --> 01:34:45,460
patent number on the label and that's

2264
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:49,180
when you'd have to respect the utility

2265
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:51,189
patent so if if you don't see a patent

2266
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:53,289
on the label chances are it's not

2267
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:54,939
patented and even if it is that the

2268
01:34:53,289 --> 01:34:56,939
patent owner isn't doing what they need

2269
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:59,439
to do to put the public on notice and

2270
01:34:56,939 --> 01:35:01,359
you would have a defense to infringement

2271
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:03,039
and now of course if you if you later

2272
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:04,539
got notice and you kept reading that

2273
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:07,329
would be a different different problem

2274
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:09,130
right on I follow that and so let's take

2275
01:35:07,329 --> 01:35:12,760
that one more step farther so if we want

2276
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:14,859
to lock down our genetics even further I

2277
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:18,730
would think that the next step would be

2278
01:35:14,859 --> 01:35:20,579
doing you know kind of a strategy like

2279
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:23,259
some of these seed companies are where

2280
01:35:20,579 --> 01:35:24,819
they are developing chemo VARs and

2281
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:26,770
honestly now they're not they're not

2282
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:29,349
just clones but but but where they're

2283
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:31,750
selling seeds in bulk to for example

2284
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:33,550
hemp folks where they'll buy five

2285
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:35,439
thousand seeds but it comes with a

2286
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:39,199
license that you won't breed or share

2287
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:40,359
sorry that is that is kind of creating

2288
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:44,170
[Music]

2289
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:48,279
a safety zone for those seeds but not

2290
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:50,470
involving the US Patent Office that's

2291
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:53,529
right that's that's really creating a

2292
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:55,930
system where your recourse against

2293
01:35:53,529 --> 01:35:57,759
someone who violates that is a breach of

2294
01:35:55,930 --> 01:36:00,579
the agreement under which you sold in

2295
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,380
the seeds the problem with that is so

2296
01:36:00,579 --> 01:36:04,090
you know if I sell seeds that are

2297
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:08,020
restricted I say you're allowed to use

2298
01:36:04,090 --> 01:36:12,400
these seeds for growing plants to grow

2299
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:13,870
harvest and material I I can't stop you

2300
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:16,479
from breeding with these seeds unless

2301
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:18,789
unless I only sell that maybe I sell

2302
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:20,319
that under terms where I say you're not

2303
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:21,789
allowed to breed with these seeds and

2304
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,679
your purchase of these seeds is an

2305
01:36:21,789 --> 01:36:26,019
acknowledgment of an agreement between

2306
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:28,210
us that you won't breed with these seeds

2307
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:31,240
then if someone did go ahead and breed

2308
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:32,920
with those seeds or did try to sell you

2309
01:36:31,239 --> 01:36:35,019
know a second generation of those seeds

2310
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,340
without your permission and that was all

2311
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:38,230
in the contract you'd be able to go

2312
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:41,110
after them for breach of contract and

2313
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:42,939
again that comes to the problem of what

2314
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:44,349
about the person downstream from that

2315
01:36:42,939 --> 01:36:45,789
agreement what if someone else gets

2316
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:48,640
their hands on those seeds and they have

2317
01:36:45,789 --> 01:36:50,050
a defense of not being a party to that

2318
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,860
agreement not being aware of the

2319
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:57,039
agreement and so yeah you can you you

2320
01:36:53,859 --> 01:36:59,139
can have agreements like a shrink-wrap

2321
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:00,789
license in the software industry that

2322
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:04,660
restrict what people do with seeds you

2323
01:37:00,789 --> 01:37:06,729
sell but unless you can show that that

2324
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:08,859
the person that that accepted those

2325
01:37:06,729 --> 01:37:11,039
terms when they bought the seeds is the

2326
01:37:08,859 --> 01:37:14,199
person that is violating those terms

2327
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:15,550
that's you know you're not you can't sue

2328
01:37:14,199 --> 01:37:17,139
someone for breach of contract if

2329
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:18,159
they're not the party to the contract

2330
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:20,740
and that's the problem

2331
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:22,989
Wow that that right there is such a

2332
01:37:20,739 --> 01:37:25,269
messy thing to have it turn on right

2333
01:37:22,989 --> 01:37:28,569
because you know some of my favorite

2334
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:31,650
seed companies are licensing their seeds

2335
01:37:28,569 --> 01:37:33,939
because the material is so unique and

2336
01:37:31,649 --> 01:37:36,969
and I do I actually believe they should

2337
01:37:33,939 --> 01:37:39,429
be able to charge to to pay for the

2338
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:41,530
research and the significant part of the

2339
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:45,210
life that they put into developing them

2340
01:37:41,529 --> 01:37:47,619
but they can really only enforce it

2341
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:51,100
against the people they had the licenses

2342
01:37:47,619 --> 01:37:51,789
if somebody they had a license with gave

2343
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:55,090
it to a

2344
01:37:51,789 --> 01:37:57,159
friends surreptitiously they can only

2345
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:59,949
sue the person they had the license with

2346
01:37:57,159 --> 01:38:01,210
not their friend that took it and

2347
01:37:59,949 --> 01:38:03,970
crossed it with something else

2348
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:07,210
that's I would call that a big gaping

2349
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:09,130
hole it is and that's that's why people

2350
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:13,090
choose to plug that hole with a patent

2351
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:14,560
and you know one of my sayings I use a

2352
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:17,140
lot is if you're a hammer everything

2353
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,480
looks like a nail and if you're a patent

2354
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:21,250
attorney you can fall into the trap of

2355
01:38:19,479 --> 01:38:22,869
thinking the solution to every problem

2356
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:25,539
is a patent and I don't want to sound

2357
01:38:22,869 --> 01:38:27,279
like that I I try to learn what people

2358
01:38:25,539 --> 01:38:28,960
want to accomplish and then help them

2359
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:31,210
accomplish that in a way that's most

2360
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,590
consistent with their needs and their

2361
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:34,869
goals and their budgets so I don't

2362
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:36,210
always recommend patent protection but

2363
01:38:34,869 --> 01:38:39,579
if you're working with biological

2364
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:42,520
organisms that that self reproduce and

2365
01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:45,100
that are so easy to reproduce in large

2366
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:49,090
quantities if you're if you're free to

2367
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:51,340
do so not having some kind of a backstop

2368
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:52,960
of intellectual property rights just

2369
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:55,869
means that you've got to have much

2370
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,149
tighter control in other aspects of your

2371
01:38:55,869 --> 01:39:01,390
business plan there's just no other way

2372
01:38:58,149 --> 01:39:03,250
around it right now I'm advocating a new

2373
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:06,130
system that would change that but but

2374
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:08,590
the current system just doesn't it

2375
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:10,300
doesn't give you recourse against anyone

2376
01:39:08,590 --> 01:39:12,940
who's not a party to the agreements that

2377
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:14,380
you made great and I'm glad that you

2378
01:39:12,939 --> 01:39:16,029
mentioned your new system because this

2379
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:19,300
is where I want to go next but before we

2380
01:39:16,029 --> 01:39:20,979
do you go there we have talked about a

2381
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:23,140
lot of Vig areas back and forth and I

2382
01:39:20,979 --> 01:39:25,569
just like would like your bulleted

2383
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:28,840
action points for somebody who is

2384
01:39:25,569 --> 01:39:31,359
listening and they are breeding their

2385
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:33,850
own seeds what is the best thing that

2386
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:35,799
they can do right now to protect

2387
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:37,600
themselves as this evolves just give me

2388
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:43,690
the short version so that they can write

2389
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:48,730
it down and have a task list first thing

2390
01:39:43,689 --> 01:39:49,989
is to make sure you're you're selling

2391
01:39:48,729 --> 01:39:51,639
your seeds with some kind of

2392
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:53,109
restrictions on the label and that you

2393
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:57,480
make that sale as conditional as

2394
01:39:53,109 --> 01:40:01,359
possible try to sell only to trustworthy

2395
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:02,859
parties and if you can't do that and you

2396
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:05,289
value those seeds and you think they'll

2397
01:40:02,859 --> 01:40:07,479
have commercial value for a long time

2398
01:40:05,289 --> 01:40:08,949
the bad news is you really do need a

2399
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:10,379
patent and it needs to be a utility

2400
01:40:08,949 --> 01:40:13,800
patent

2401
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:16,270
okay and I think that that probably

2402
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:18,100
describes just about everybody in the

2403
01:40:16,270 --> 01:40:20,230
seed game so then what are the next

2404
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:22,930
steps they take to do that and let me

2405
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:25,059
just let me just amend that if if it's

2406
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:26,619
industrial hemp then you have two

2407
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:29,020
options you've got utility patent or

2408
01:40:26,619 --> 01:40:31,300
plant for any protection certificate but

2409
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:33,310
there are some reasons not to do PvP

2410
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:35,110
including that there's an express

2411
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:37,000
exemption that permits people to breed

2412
01:40:35,109 --> 01:40:39,039
with the seeds that they obtain that are

2413
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,529
protected that way so it still goes back

2414
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:44,199
to utility patent the steps are if you

2415
01:40:41,529 --> 01:40:47,889
want a utility patent make sure that you

2416
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:50,260
that you get an application filed within

2417
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:52,690
a year of the first the first public

2418
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:56,440
availability of the seeds or any part

2419
01:40:52,689 --> 01:40:58,689
any any part of the plant so you've got

2420
01:40:56,439 --> 01:40:59,769
to move relatively quickly make sure

2421
01:40:58,689 --> 01:41:00,909
that you're working with someone that

2422
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:03,310
knows what they're doing

2423
01:41:00,909 --> 01:41:06,340
find out how many plant patents they've

2424
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:08,340
filed before or not even plant patents

2425
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:11,739
but utility patents relating to plants

2426
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:14,440
and you know just just make sure that

2427
01:41:11,738 --> 01:41:15,849
you are getting what you pay for when it

2428
01:41:14,439 --> 01:41:18,009
comes to getting the legal advice that

2429
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:19,810
you need okay so so let's talk about

2430
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:23,949
this new idea that you've put together

2431
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:27,850
for a new spirited international

2432
01:41:23,949 --> 01:41:30,519
convention that would protect nearly all

2433
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:32,680
the people who are breeding cannabis

2434
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:35,470
plants because it certainly got me

2435
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:39,220
excited listening to it and it sounds

2436
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:41,500
like a really great way for to bring

2437
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:43,810
everybody together for the good of the

2438
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:45,729
availability of the plant and honestly

2439
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:47,500
it feels a lot like open source it the

2440
01:41:45,729 --> 01:41:49,119
more you and I talked about it so so go

2441
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:54,039
ahead and give us the the elevator

2442
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:56,680
speech if you will yeah I have been an

2443
01:41:54,039 --> 01:41:58,750
advocate I've been sympathetic at least

2444
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:00,850
to open source and I advocate its use

2445
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:02,979
for people who want to use it it's not

2446
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:05,470
for everybody but the problem the

2447
01:42:02,979 --> 01:42:09,069
biggest problem with open source in

2448
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:11,039
plant genetics is its contrast with or

2449
01:42:09,069 --> 01:42:14,738
as demonstrated by contrasting it with

2450
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:16,810
with computer software software open

2451
01:42:14,738 --> 01:42:18,609
source works because software has an

2452
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:19,360
automatic copyright the moment it's

2453
01:42:18,609 --> 01:42:21,130
create

2454
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:23,380
you don't have to apply for a copyright

2455
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:26,230
the problem with open source in plant

2456
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:28,300
genetics is that there is no automatic

2457
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:30,609
right that exists upon creating a new

2458
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:32,829
genetic selection you have to go apply

2459
01:42:30,609 --> 01:42:35,289
for that you have to pay for it and so

2460
01:42:32,829 --> 01:42:37,239
the analogy between an open source

2461
01:42:35,289 --> 01:42:40,439
software and open source plant genetics

2462
01:42:37,239 --> 01:42:42,609
breaks down at this point where a

2463
01:42:40,439 --> 01:42:44,469
copyright infringement is a form of

2464
01:42:42,609 --> 01:42:46,630
recourse you can use against someone who

2465
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:48,640
never agreed to your your the conditions

2466
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:51,430
of your open source software situation

2467
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:54,010
but if you create an open source seed

2468
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:56,380
sharing or genetic sharing community and

2469
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:58,960
someone is outside that agreement and

2470
01:42:56,380 --> 01:43:00,730
you don't have underlying IP rights to

2471
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,050
assert against them you don't have

2472
01:43:00,729 --> 01:43:03,219
anything to assert against them because

2473
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:04,779
you can't go that after them for

2474
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:07,060
breaching your agreement they weren't a

2475
01:43:04,779 --> 01:43:11,170
party to your agreement and so what I'm

2476
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:12,880
advocating is a form of plant breeders

2477
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:16,659
right that is very similar to a

2478
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:18,579
copyright and now copyrights exist upon

2479
01:43:16,659 --> 01:43:19,930
creation of an original work because

2480
01:43:18,579 --> 01:43:22,180
there there was an international

2481
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:23,950
convention though there still is called

2482
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:27,880
the Berne Convention that was

2483
01:43:23,949 --> 01:43:30,279
established in 1896 or 1886 I think in

2484
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:32,319
the the US I don't remember 86 96

2485
01:43:30,279 --> 01:43:35,349
whatever but the u.s. joined it a

2486
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:38,109
hundred and two years later and so as of

2487
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:39,760
that date copyrights in the US were

2488
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:43,479
automatically protected I think it was

2489
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:45,449
it was 86 and 88 so in 1988 the u.s.

2490
01:43:43,479 --> 01:43:47,559
finally joined the Berne Convention and

2491
01:43:45,449 --> 01:43:49,569
copyrights became automatically

2492
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:52,600
protectable as soon as you created an

2493
01:43:49,569 --> 01:43:53,829
original work now what I'm advocating is

2494
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:56,320
something very much like the Berne

2495
01:43:53,829 --> 01:43:59,409
Convention for plant breeders so that

2496
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:01,509
when you create an original cross and

2497
01:43:59,409 --> 01:44:03,609
you make a selection and you you

2498
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:05,560
establish a cultivar that you don't have

2499
01:44:03,609 --> 01:44:07,059
to apply for any form of protection it's

2500
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:09,640
already there it's there like a

2501
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:13,750
copyright and someone who violates that

2502
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:16,960
by illicitly obtaining and propagating

2503
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:19,770
your genetic selection would be in

2504
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:22,060
violation just the same as someone who

2505
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:24,850
illicitly obtained some software code

2506
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:26,140
and commercialize that that's what I'm

2507
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:27,730
advocating it's going to take some work

2508
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:29,619
but I think there are enough people who

2509
01:44:27,729 --> 01:44:32,379
would benefit from this and enough

2510
01:44:29,619 --> 01:44:35,469
people who care about it that I do

2511
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:38,679
10 for this just to be talk so if if

2512
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:40,779
every single seed is unique and you're

2513
01:44:38,679 --> 01:44:44,020
talking about giving everybody who's

2514
01:44:40,779 --> 01:44:46,029
plant breeding default protection how

2515
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:49,270
does that drill down to the uniqueness

2516
01:44:46,029 --> 01:44:52,029
of every individual seed that's a great

2517
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:55,270
question and if you if you read the blog

2518
01:44:52,029 --> 01:44:57,729
that I wrote about open source one of

2519
01:44:55,270 --> 01:45:00,850
the headings is my dad is such a pain

2520
01:44:57,729 --> 01:45:04,569
lol now the reason that's relevant is

2521
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:06,850
that anything we ever write anything we

2522
01:45:04,569 --> 01:45:08,979
ever write that is original is protected

2523
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:10,840
by copyright but that doesn't mean we

2524
01:45:08,979 --> 01:45:13,059
commercialize we do anything with most

2525
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:16,029
of those copyrights every email you've

2526
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:18,039
written today and my example in the blog

2527
01:45:16,029 --> 01:45:20,920
is everything my kids text on their

2528
01:45:18,039 --> 01:45:23,109
phones practically is copyright

2529
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:25,929
protected unless it's completely

2530
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:28,899
unoriginal like my dad is such a pain

2531
01:45:25,929 --> 01:45:30,760
lol that's not original enough to

2532
01:45:28,899 --> 01:45:32,469
qualify for copyright because my kids

2533
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:36,250
were not the first ones to type that in

2534
01:45:32,469 --> 01:45:39,448
a text even if they type it a lot so the

2535
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:42,698
point is that there's there's a there's

2536
01:45:39,448 --> 01:45:43,839
more copyright protected material out

2537
01:45:42,698 --> 01:45:46,029
there in the world that's being created

2538
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:48,239
every second than anyone is ever going

2539
01:45:46,029 --> 01:45:50,769
to do anything with in terms of

2540
01:45:48,238 --> 01:45:52,238
particular ting their legal rights but

2541
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:54,370
the fact that that protection is

2542
01:45:52,238 --> 01:45:56,169
automatic gives you all kinds of

2543
01:45:54,369 --> 01:45:58,329
latitude if you write a blog or if you

2544
01:45:56,170 --> 01:45:59,980
write software or if you you know

2545
01:45:58,329 --> 01:46:02,079
whatever whatever kind of creation you

2546
01:45:59,979 --> 01:46:03,939
you you do whatever kind of creative

2547
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:07,019
activity that that is protectable by

2548
01:46:03,939 --> 01:46:10,509
copyright you've got that just by having

2549
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:11,949
created it and by analogy you know if

2550
01:46:10,510 --> 01:46:14,920
you think about all the text of people

2551
01:46:11,948 --> 01:46:16,928
right that might be analogous to all the

2552
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:19,420
diversity that is in a single batch of

2553
01:46:16,929 --> 01:46:24,010
seeds every one of those seeds would be

2554
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:26,350
protectable would be would be under the

2555
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:28,510
basically the the the basic breeders

2556
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:30,070
right but what they choose to do with

2557
01:46:28,510 --> 01:46:31,510
that is another thing now how many

2558
01:46:30,069 --> 01:46:33,009
people how many things do we have that

2559
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:35,110
are copyright protected that we never

2560
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:36,480
care to assert our rights over but if

2561
01:46:35,109 --> 01:46:38,799
something in there is really valuable

2562
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:41,079
the difference between the text that you

2563
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,579
send and a book that you write then

2564
01:46:41,079 --> 01:46:44,350
you're going to have some rights that

2565
01:46:42,579 --> 01:46:46,000
you do care to assert but you still

2566
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:48,340
don't have to go

2567
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,140
apply for those rights now let's extend

2568
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:52,360
that let's apply that to an open-source

2569
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:53,980
system if every breeder that puts

2570
01:46:52,359 --> 01:46:58,149
something into an open-source system

2571
01:46:53,979 --> 01:47:00,129
already had a right to assert against

2572
01:46:58,149 --> 01:47:02,229
someone who used their their genetics

2573
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:03,730
without permission then an open-source

2574
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:06,639
system would work because within the

2575
01:47:03,729 --> 01:47:08,739
system you'd say all right we're gonna

2576
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:10,420
share seeds under conditions we've all

2577
01:47:08,739 --> 01:47:11,559
got rights under these CR these seeds

2578
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:15,039
but we're gonna share them under

2579
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:16,510
conditions that you will do you know

2580
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:18,369
this and that and you won't do this

2581
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:19,750
other thing with these seeds or that if

2582
01:47:18,369 --> 01:47:22,329
you do this other thing let's say if you

2583
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:24,310
if you commercialize something that was

2584
01:47:22,329 --> 01:47:25,989
derived from these genetics that you

2585
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:27,789
have to pay something back into a fund

2586
01:47:25,989 --> 01:47:29,199
that protects everyone from patent

2587
01:47:27,789 --> 01:47:29,680
infringement litigation or something

2588
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:32,260
like that

2589
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:34,980
so you can put conditions on the use of

2590
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:37,989
those seeds and if everyone had

2591
01:47:34,979 --> 01:47:41,699
protection of their genetic varieties

2592
01:47:37,989 --> 01:47:44,170
that was automatic then anyone who

2593
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:45,489
illicitly obtained those seeds and did

2594
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:47,859
something that was outside the

2595
01:47:45,489 --> 01:47:49,719
open-source system you'd have recourse

2596
01:47:47,859 --> 01:47:52,359
against them just like people have

2597
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:55,750
recourse against against a copyright

2598
01:47:52,359 --> 01:47:58,210
infringer so if it plugs the hole that

2599
01:47:55,750 --> 01:48:00,609
exists we talked about the fact that you

2600
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:01,779
can't sue someone for contract for

2601
01:48:00,609 --> 01:48:04,539
breach of contract if they're not a

2602
01:48:01,779 --> 01:48:06,189
party to that contract but you can sue

2603
01:48:04,539 --> 01:48:08,470
someone for breach of an intellectual

2604
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:10,210
property right without ever having a

2605
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:12,550
contract with them that's a really

2606
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:15,850
interesting and engaging idea the fact

2607
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:19,409
that if if every seed that is bred is

2608
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:24,850
automatically protected it opens us up

2609
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:29,979
to be able to more casually share the

2610
01:48:24,850 --> 01:48:31,810
seeds with other seed makers because we

2611
01:48:29,979 --> 01:48:34,629
don't really have to worry about what

2612
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:36,280
they're doing with it and so it's it

2613
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:38,529
reminds me of that old phrase fences

2614
01:48:36,279 --> 01:48:40,779
make good neighbors well it's like if

2615
01:48:38,529 --> 01:48:42,759
everybody who's breeding already has got

2616
01:48:40,779 --> 01:48:45,340
protections for their stuff but people

2617
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:49,690
generally don't mind if other people are

2618
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:53,230
breeding with their seeds as well then

2619
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:55,029
everybody kind of is this is on equal

2620
01:48:53,229 --> 01:48:57,159
footing which I think most is what most

2621
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:59,869
breeders want I think most breeders just

2622
01:48:57,159 --> 01:49:02,470
don't want their work usurped

2623
01:48:59,869 --> 01:49:05,809
right people recoil at the notion of

2624
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:07,880
having everything just just dripping

2625
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:09,590
with intellectual property because it's

2626
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:12,619
new to them and it sounds like that's

2627
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:14,210
just overkill but the real overkill the

2628
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:15,649
real problem is the difficulty and

2629
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,970
expense of getting the intellectual

2630
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:18,649
property protection because once you

2631
01:49:16,970 --> 01:49:20,119
have it you're free to do whatever you

2632
01:49:18,649 --> 01:49:22,939
want with it including just leave it

2633
01:49:20,119 --> 01:49:25,399
there and not not assert it at all we're

2634
01:49:22,939 --> 01:49:28,579
not we're not troubled by the automatic

2635
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:30,379
nature of copyright protection I would

2636
01:49:28,579 --> 01:49:32,829
say that plant breeding is at least as

2637
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:36,650
much a creative activity as writing is

2638
01:49:32,829 --> 01:49:38,750
you know certainly not not all plant

2639
01:49:36,649 --> 01:49:40,369
breeding results are created equal and

2640
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:41,960
not all writing is created equal but

2641
01:49:40,369 --> 01:49:43,849
it's all protected by copyright and it

2642
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:48,079
hasn't made you know planes fall out of

2643
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:49,970
the sky and and disaster happen all over

2644
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:51,619
the place it so it's it's it's a little

2645
01:49:49,970 --> 01:49:53,630
bit foreign and it in a way it's

2646
01:49:51,619 --> 01:49:56,000
counterintuitive just like you said all

2647
01:49:53,630 --> 01:49:58,430
of these rights that everyone have has

2648
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,310
would actually make it safer and easier

2649
01:49:58,430 --> 01:50:03,320
to share what we have because it would

2650
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:06,110
it would give us a way to kind of sift

2651
01:50:03,319 --> 01:50:08,539
between the people who are willing to

2652
01:50:06,109 --> 01:50:11,000
play by some some basic rules of respect

2653
01:50:08,539 --> 01:50:12,619
and trustworthiness and still have some

2654
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,300
recourse against people who aren't

2655
01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:15,920
willing to do that someone who comes in

2656
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,980
and and takes what you've got and then

2657
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,720
commercializes it and and does something

2658
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:21,829
you don't approve of or whatever you've

2659
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:25,220
got you're gonna have some recourse

2660
01:50:21,829 --> 01:50:27,319
against them also so I see one more big

2661
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:30,710
challenge to this the first one of

2662
01:50:27,319 --> 01:50:32,630
course being this this you know keeping

2663
01:50:30,710 --> 01:50:34,850
in balance protecting myself while

2664
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:36,230
wanting to share with you and and I and

2665
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:39,579
I like your I like your answer to that

2666
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:43,939
but as we've seen time and time again

2667
01:50:39,579 --> 01:50:46,939
well-funded folks are are just pushing

2668
01:50:43,939 --> 01:50:48,889
low funded folks to go to settlement and

2669
01:50:46,939 --> 01:50:51,109
not really getting their day in court

2670
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:54,590
just simply because they can outspend

2671
01:50:51,109 --> 01:50:57,139
them legally how would a small person in

2672
01:50:54,590 --> 01:51:00,380
your or an under financed person in your

2673
01:50:57,140 --> 01:51:01,720
system defend their automatic patent on

2674
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:07,670
their seeds

2675
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:09,440
well that that kind of depends on if

2676
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:12,109
they're trying to assert their rights

2677
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:14,659
against against someone who is who's

2678
01:51:12,109 --> 01:51:18,889
using their seeds without permission

2679
01:51:14,659 --> 01:51:22,909
that's a challenge because there you

2680
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:25,100
know the you face you face different

2681
01:51:22,909 --> 01:51:27,680
challenges when you're asserting your

2682
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:29,450
rights then when someone is asserting

2683
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,770
their rights against you you you

2684
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:33,679
basically you've got to fund the

2685
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:36,920
litigation upfront and if the abuse is

2686
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:40,460
bad enough then you may be able to

2687
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:43,250
recover damages one thing that I've

2688
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:46,069
advocated in addition to this open

2689
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:50,359
source system which is more about

2690
01:51:46,069 --> 01:51:52,729
defending against abusive patent suits

2691
01:51:50,359 --> 01:51:56,239
against defending people who are who are

2692
01:51:52,729 --> 01:52:01,399
sued for infringing and abusive patent

2693
01:51:56,239 --> 01:52:04,399
is a system of mutual defense and but

2694
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:06,500
that is about defending against being

2695
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:09,379
sued for an abusive you know an abusive

2696
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:11,960
over-broad patent that we that the

2697
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:15,590
community has already come to the disc

2698
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:19,850
um to the conclusion that is invalid and

2699
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:22,460
should be fought so I do advocate in a

2700
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:26,660
blog that I wrote called standing up to

2701
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:28,460
big AG a mutual defense approach where

2702
01:52:26,659 --> 01:52:30,619
it's kind of like NATO you know if you

2703
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:32,859
sue any of our members we're going to

2704
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:35,180
band together and use all of our patents

2705
01:52:32,859 --> 01:52:37,309
to see if there's any of our patents

2706
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:40,119
that we own that we could counter sue

2707
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:44,750
against you for infringing our patent

2708
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:47,059
that's better described in the blog than

2709
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:49,250
we have time for in this situation but

2710
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:55,100
basically it's a mutual defense approach

2711
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:56,840
and we are actually I'm I don't like to

2712
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:59,930
just write about things and not put them

2713
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:02,300
into action I am trying to form some

2714
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:05,630
kind of a coalition of United small

2715
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:09,079
cannabis companies and and individual

2716
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:12,020
breeders that can create that kind of

2717
01:53:09,079 --> 01:53:13,359
mutual defense in the event that one of

2718
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:19,570
them gets sued for patent infringement

2719
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:24,380
it's harder to put together a mutual

2720
01:53:19,569 --> 01:53:26,359
offensive approach just because it's

2721
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:27,619
it's it's harder to insure against it's

2722
01:53:26,359 --> 01:53:31,250
harder for it to get in

2723
01:53:27,619 --> 01:53:32,899
for that kind of outcome but it could

2724
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:35,390
still happen and I think depending on

2725
01:53:32,899 --> 01:53:39,699
how you fund the open source system you

2726
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:39,700
know if if the open source system has

2727
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:48,020
some kind of fund that people who

2728
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:50,329
infringe it have to you know if they

2729
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:52,010
let's say the the the damages that come

2730
01:53:50,329 --> 01:53:55,460
from an infringement of an open source

2731
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:57,470
system if those damages went into a fund

2732
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:59,899
that could then be used to further

2733
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:01,940
assert the rights against you know just

2734
01:53:59,899 --> 01:54:04,159
the people who violate the system that's

2735
01:54:01,939 --> 01:54:07,960
a pretty sensible thing to do with with

2736
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:10,220
proceeds from an open source fund but

2737
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:12,739
those are really two different things

2738
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:16,640
the mutual defense against offense

2739
01:54:12,739 --> 01:54:20,569
against being sued for infringement of

2740
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:22,700
an overbroad utility patent is kind of a

2741
01:54:20,569 --> 01:54:26,139
separate institution separate animal

2742
01:54:22,699 --> 01:54:28,909
from the the open source and open

2743
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:31,640
automatic rights approach all right I

2744
01:54:28,909 --> 01:54:33,859
follow that and so so a lot please allow

2745
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:36,079
me to distill this down to see if I've

2746
01:54:33,859 --> 01:54:38,359
got this right so so what you're

2747
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:40,699
proposing is kind of like this this this

2748
01:54:38,359 --> 01:54:43,189
two-part 1-2 punch thing the first thing

2749
01:54:40,699 --> 01:54:46,340
that we need to do is to set up an

2750
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:48,649
international convention so that there

2751
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:49,579
is a default setting that when breeders

2752
01:54:48,649 --> 01:54:50,839
and it sounds like you're talking about

2753
01:54:49,579 --> 01:54:53,779
all plants but since we're talk about

2754
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:57,529
cannabis where where cannabis breeders

2755
01:54:53,779 --> 01:55:00,679
the moment they make the cross and they

2756
01:54:57,529 --> 01:55:05,119
have resultant seeds those are by

2757
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:07,100
default defended by a patent and so that

2758
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:09,529
creates the protections that most

2759
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:13,070
everybody is needing and then your

2760
01:55:09,529 --> 01:55:16,039
second is let's pull these newly

2761
01:55:13,069 --> 01:55:20,090
protected breeders together into some

2762
01:55:16,039 --> 01:55:23,090
kind of cannabis breeders union and and

2763
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:25,670
call ourselves an organization and you

2764
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:28,640
know pay some sort of yearly fee that

2765
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:32,449
will go to litigation insurance so that

2766
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:36,020
if any one of us is having to defend

2767
01:55:32,449 --> 01:55:38,659
ourselves we are able to turn on the in

2768
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:40,969
turn to the insurance policy so that all

2769
01:55:38,659 --> 01:55:44,229
of all of we

2770
01:55:40,969 --> 01:55:46,939
sir funded cannabis folks are able to

2771
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:49,219
represent ourselves the same way that

2772
01:55:46,939 --> 01:55:51,768
NATO if one country gets attacked

2773
01:55:49,219 --> 01:55:54,380
everybody comes another defense is that

2774
01:55:51,769 --> 01:55:56,360
it do my close that's pretty close I

2775
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:58,069
would just I would correct not even

2776
01:55:56,359 --> 01:55:59,748
correct I just am and one thing that you

2777
01:55:58,069 --> 01:56:02,058
said about you know the automatic

2778
01:55:59,748 --> 01:56:04,038
protection for plant breeders it

2779
01:56:02,059 --> 01:56:05,719
wouldn't be a patent because patents get

2780
01:56:04,038 --> 01:56:07,130
applied for and they get examined and

2781
01:56:05,719 --> 01:56:10,189
they have certain rights it would be

2782
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:13,819
more like a copyright that is that that

2783
01:56:10,189 --> 01:56:15,498
is automatic and it's basically just a

2784
01:56:13,819 --> 01:56:18,639
prohibition it's not something you can

2785
01:56:15,498 --> 01:56:23,269
write claims for and that you that you

2786
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:25,969
you copyrights are inherently available

2787
01:56:23,269 --> 01:56:29,809
but they're they're not as I'd say

2788
01:56:25,969 --> 01:56:32,989
they're not as usually complicated or

2789
01:56:29,809 --> 01:56:34,369
strong as patent rights per se and so

2790
01:56:32,988 --> 01:56:36,198
what I'm advocating for is a really

2791
01:56:34,368 --> 01:56:38,478
basic breeders right that but that gives

2792
01:56:36,198 --> 01:56:41,569
you some recourse against someone who

2793
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:43,070
would in infringe your your rights all

2794
01:56:41,569 --> 01:56:45,349
you'd have to do is just show that yeah

2795
01:56:43,069 --> 01:56:49,009
this is your this is your part your your

2796
01:56:45,349 --> 01:56:51,769
selection your the result of your

2797
01:56:49,010 --> 01:56:54,409
breeding and that someone has in print

2798
01:56:51,769 --> 01:56:56,599
has had someone's taken it that the DNA

2799
01:56:54,408 --> 01:56:58,638
matches and therefore you have a right

2800
01:56:56,599 --> 01:57:01,369
to stop them from from making further

2801
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:02,989
use of it in a way that would be very

2802
01:57:01,368 --> 01:57:04,848
similar to a patent but it would just be

2803
01:57:02,988 --> 01:57:06,288
I don't think you'd want to use the term

2804
01:57:04,849 --> 01:57:08,210
patent because that implies it's gone

2805
01:57:06,288 --> 01:57:10,038
through this whole process that's great

2806
01:57:08,210 --> 01:57:12,469
route going so it's not really a patent

2807
01:57:10,038 --> 01:57:14,868
or a copyright it is not a patent but

2808
01:57:12,469 --> 01:57:16,729
it's kind of like a patent but it's not

2809
01:57:14,868 --> 01:57:18,889
in its and it's kind of like copyright

2810
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:21,710
but it's not a copyright it's some third

2811
01:57:18,889 --> 01:57:24,618
thing yeah I'm advocating the creation

2812
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:26,599
of a natural plant breeders right to the

2813
01:57:24,618 --> 01:57:27,889
the selections of you know the crosses

2814
01:57:26,599 --> 01:57:30,559
and the selections that that breeder

2815
01:57:27,889 --> 01:57:32,210
makes that would be equivalent to a

2816
01:57:30,559 --> 01:57:35,479
copyright it wouldn't be the same as a

2817
01:57:32,210 --> 01:57:37,578
patent but it would give the breeder the

2818
01:57:35,479 --> 01:57:40,010
right to control what people do with

2819
01:57:37,578 --> 01:57:41,840
that production just the same as a

2820
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:43,639
writer has the right to control what

2821
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:46,159
people do with his or her written work

2822
01:57:43,639 --> 01:57:49,219
you know as as you roll this out and you

2823
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:51,170
and you start to make this real you're

2824
01:57:49,219 --> 01:57:53,448
gonna have to find yourself a new

2825
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:56,029
vocabulary right because patent

2826
01:57:53,448 --> 01:57:58,219
the word is not only not what you're

2827
01:57:56,029 --> 01:58:00,948
doing but it's packed with all of these

2828
01:57:58,219 --> 01:58:04,279
expectations and and such from people

2829
01:58:00,948 --> 01:58:07,488
and then it's also not copyright and

2830
01:58:04,279 --> 01:58:09,050
it's also not open source and so what

2831
01:58:07,488 --> 01:58:12,529
you're creating is an animal that we

2832
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:14,329
have not seen in cannabis so far and I

2833
01:58:12,529 --> 01:58:17,509
think I think that you need some new

2834
01:58:14,329 --> 01:58:19,488
vocabulary man yeah we do and and but

2835
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:22,219
the whole reason to do this is to

2836
01:58:19,488 --> 01:58:23,959
facilitate open source it's to make it

2837
01:58:22,219 --> 01:58:26,359
so that you'd you can have recourse

2838
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:28,130
against people who are not parties to

2839
01:58:26,359 --> 01:58:29,960
your open source agreement if they're if

2840
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:32,840
they're violating your open source terms

2841
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:34,640
without ever having agreed to them it

2842
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:36,170
gives you a recourse just like people

2843
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:38,719
have a recourse against copyright

2844
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:40,760
infringers that's the whole point of it

2845
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:42,800
and there may be some other things that

2846
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:44,630
people could do with it but the the main

2847
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,420
the reason I came up with this idea is

2848
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:49,039
that it it would fit would make open

2849
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:52,520
source workable and I want to see open

2850
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:54,380
source be workable so it's it's

2851
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:56,810
explained in more detail in the blog

2852
01:58:54,380 --> 01:59:00,289
that I wrote about that and then in

2853
01:58:56,810 --> 01:59:02,179
terms of the mutual defence fund it is

2854
01:59:00,289 --> 01:59:03,890
it would be really a group that

2855
01:59:02,179 --> 01:59:06,170
purchases some kind of group litigation

2856
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:08,630
insurance I've done some preliminary

2857
01:59:06,170 --> 01:59:10,219
pricing on this and I I don't have a

2858
01:59:08,630 --> 01:59:11,929
strong enough commitment on the pricing

2859
01:59:10,219 --> 01:59:14,060
to be able to quote it or anything but

2860
01:59:11,929 --> 01:59:16,730
the idea would be that yes you have a

2861
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:18,980
coalition that forms an organization

2862
01:59:16,729 --> 01:59:20,599
that buys this group insurance and that

2863
01:59:18,979 --> 01:59:22,129
the group insurance covers people who

2864
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:25,550
get sued for patent infringement

2865
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:27,980
so that they have just as big a patent

2866
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:29,779
in a patent litigation war chest as the

2867
01:59:27,979 --> 01:59:32,089
people who are suing them so that the

2868
01:59:29,779 --> 01:59:33,679
size disparity goes away and then

2869
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:35,810
there's also a mutual commitment by

2870
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:37,940
members of this organization that if

2871
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:41,030
they have a patent that this other said

2872
01:59:37,939 --> 01:59:43,669
that this that this opponent is is

2873
01:59:41,029 --> 01:59:46,670
infringing that the defendant can use

2874
01:59:43,670 --> 01:59:48,560
this other organization members patent

2875
01:59:46,670 --> 01:59:50,420
against them just and it is in a way

2876
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:53,120
analogous to NATO that you know you

2877
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:55,069
point your guns at me everybody on my

2878
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:56,988
team's guns point back at you and so we

2879
01:59:55,069 --> 01:59:58,729
hopefully don't shoot each other we

2880
01:59:56,988 --> 02:00:01,759
decide to find a way to settle our

2881
01:59:58,729 --> 02:00:03,500
differences obviously this would need to

2882
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:07,400
be administered by some kind of a

2883
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:12,500
non-profit and but I think that

2884
02:00:07,399 --> 02:00:14,960
once once we had an idea of how many

2885
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:17,569
members were interested in that and what

2886
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:21,020
the insurance rates would be then you

2887
02:00:17,569 --> 02:00:23,899
basically charge a fee that covers that

2888
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:26,060
plus maybe the cost of one administrator

2889
02:00:23,899 --> 02:00:29,659
and then you have a mutual defense

2890
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:33,470
that's workable it it's not something

2891
02:00:29,659 --> 02:00:35,269
that I that I would advocate doing on a

2892
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:37,400
for-profit basis just because we have so

2893
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:39,410
many trust issues in this industry

2894
02:00:37,399 --> 02:00:42,049
already if someone thought this was just

2895
02:00:39,409 --> 02:00:44,029
a scheme to make money I don't think

2896
02:00:42,050 --> 02:00:47,619
people would want to be part of it but

2897
02:00:44,029 --> 02:00:51,139
if we see that see it as an answer to

2898
02:00:47,619 --> 02:00:53,659
the does the balance the the imbalance

2899
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:56,539
of power between big cannabis or big AG

2900
02:00:53,659 --> 02:00:57,409
and a bunch of small cannabis people who

2901
02:00:56,539 --> 02:00:58,699
still want to be able to stay in

2902
02:00:57,409 --> 02:01:00,170
business they don't want to have to

2903
02:00:58,699 --> 02:01:02,689
consolidate they don't want to have to

2904
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:06,230
sell to a big company they want to be

2905
02:01:02,689 --> 02:01:09,169
able to stand and and and do what

2906
02:01:06,229 --> 02:01:11,349
they're doing and and not not be at the

2907
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:13,699
mercy of this huge imbalance of power

2908
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:15,770
that the way to do that would be to form

2909
02:01:13,699 --> 02:01:18,559
a coalition that actually has teeth in

2910
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:20,600
it that can provide a mutual defense in

2911
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:22,310
the event that some of these over broad

2912
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:25,670
patents get asserted against one member

2913
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:28,039
of the community so Dale just because I

2914
02:01:25,670 --> 02:01:30,980
know you a bit I know that this is

2915
02:01:28,039 --> 02:01:33,159
actually kind of a activists kind of

2916
02:01:30,979 --> 02:01:37,099
heart taking thing that you're taking on

2917
02:01:33,159 --> 02:01:39,800
and yet most of the listeners including

2918
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:43,700
me you know like we're stoners who know

2919
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:46,220
about pipe dreams right and so what can

2920
02:01:43,699 --> 02:01:48,800
you tell us that that would encourage

2921
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:50,900
people to pay attention to what you're

2922
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,940
doing or think that this is reasonable

2923
02:01:50,899 --> 02:01:54,710
that this has come together instead of

2924
02:01:52,939 --> 02:01:59,599
just being a really great story to tell

2925
02:01:54,710 --> 02:02:01,909
over a bowl well I think the the that

2926
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:04,760
the answer always has to be watch what

2927
02:02:01,909 --> 02:02:06,260
people do and not just what they say do

2928
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:09,260
you cut them some slack in terms of

2929
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:11,090
getting things done and if you're not

2930
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:14,210
sure whether they're real or not talk to

2931
02:02:11,090 --> 02:02:19,069
them and offer to help and you know if

2932
02:02:14,210 --> 02:02:20,920
someone if if someone thinks that I'm

2933
02:02:19,069 --> 02:02:25,840
floating these ideas just

2934
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:28,270
for fun or just to give people kind of a

2935
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:30,460
like a temporary pipe dream or something

2936
02:02:28,270 --> 02:02:34,239
talk to me reach out to me ask how you

2937
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:36,189
can help because I do want to I do want

2938
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:38,379
to turn these things into action I have

2939
02:02:36,189 --> 02:02:40,299
become a bit of an activist even though

2940
02:02:38,380 --> 02:02:43,060
I still run a law firm and have to pay

2941
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:47,440
bills and things like that a lot of what

2942
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:50,380
I do and care about the most is not

2943
02:02:47,439 --> 02:02:52,089
really tied to anything that I can bill

2944
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:53,980
anybody for in my law firm I just want

2945
02:02:52,090 --> 02:02:55,779
to see things work well enough that

2946
02:02:53,979 --> 02:02:59,439
everybody in this industry prospers and

2947
02:02:55,779 --> 02:03:01,179
and achieves their their goals well Dale

2948
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:03,009
this has been great and I really

2949
02:03:01,179 --> 02:03:05,529
appreciate meeting an attorney who I

2950
02:03:03,010 --> 02:03:08,590
find both personable or divine

2951
02:03:05,529 --> 02:03:10,719
personable skilled and on my side and

2952
02:03:08,590 --> 02:03:13,510
usually I don't get all three in the

2953
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:15,510
same so so thank you very much for for

2954
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:18,280
spending your valuable time with us

2955
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:20,980
helping us get to the bottom of these

2956
02:03:18,279 --> 02:03:23,019
two biotech and United cannabis patents

2957
02:03:20,979 --> 02:03:24,750
that people are talking about a lot but

2958
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:27,310
didn't really understand very well and

2959
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:29,289
kind of bring this up to the state of

2960
02:03:27,310 --> 02:03:30,730
the art or the state of play of where

2961
02:03:29,289 --> 02:03:31,779
cannabis patents are today because we

2962
02:03:30,729 --> 02:03:34,419
really just want to protect ourselves

2963
02:03:31,779 --> 02:03:36,429
and it sounds like our best play is

2964
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:38,319
gonna be to continually work together so

2965
02:03:36,429 --> 02:03:40,359
IVA I'm pretty sure that we're gonna

2966
02:03:38,319 --> 02:03:42,069
have you back on again because this has

2967
02:03:40,359 --> 02:03:44,170

2968
02:03:42,069 --> 02:03:45,189
