[Applause]

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,060
thanks for a mentor what makes that very

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,060
fine well I really appreciate it and I

4
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:28,589
had this wonderful speech all imperative

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,970
it's pretty much ripped it up maybe I'll

6
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:34,409
have done a little bit of it but first

7
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:39,539
thanks so much for having today and you

8
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:42,599
know where to start praying for our so I

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,549
thought about trying to do is accept

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,329
like and share with and developing last

11
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,338
24 hours

12
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,228
Pappas's focus on email sent by the

13
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,878
Attorney General all right get that

14
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:53,518
specifically don't you touch on us in

15
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,228
your reductionism I just have such

16
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:56,759
tremendous of frustrations with you to

17
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:58,079
any gentleman so not just because we

18
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,640
kind of disagree with you I made it

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,338
really not right I have the spirits of

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,019
people all time breaking part of my job

21
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:08,489
as a lawyer to have an adversarial

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,350
system my family said it gets six boys

23
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,750
when moms covering sister I mean it's a

24
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,599
big town in Kenya where the Christmas

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,150
table makes people we don't all agree on

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,679
anything right we don't miss that's the

27
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,230
way it works the big families I'm used

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,640
to that but it's hard that the Attorney

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,770
General just want to get you the first

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,599
death I think this important is number

31
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,599
one we had no idea this time

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,109
[ __ ] we have no idea this is coming

33
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:40,289
myself Jeff you name it

34
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:44,039
number two is the Italian kettle since

35
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:48,349
became Attorney General refused

36
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,349
immediately accused me of the governor

37
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,450
these conversations on issues of this

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,069
magnitude the legalization marijuana for

39
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,659
God's sakes right what that means for

40
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,728
our country and our state that's pretty

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,250
good right and it strikes me that face

42
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:03,840
to face conversation is hope doesn't

43
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,909
you're in reanimated but their health as

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,500
an example right after I call that the

45
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,599
Attorney General Governor James Lee was

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,549
elected governor or president wobbles

47
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,488
coming in Washington and they're like

48
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:18,450
marijuana careful those of you trying

49
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:22,469
down and so we have a new system we're

50
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,818
going to place and we think how things

51
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,590
were really inserted that Colorado

52
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,298
Washington the two states have legalized

53
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,219
not sure what the Obama administration

54
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:37,709
would do and why the watch the Colorado

55
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:39,959
legalized and they asked for DC right I

56
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,590
will have me was a pretty

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,379
straightforward

58
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,719
I wanted to negate care holder

59
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,310
respectfully Yukito very clearly then I

60
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,979
would defend the will voters in

61
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,709
Washington State but there was no in me

62
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,539
that did not halt Washington having

63
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,430
legalized marijuana from my standpoint

64
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:58,858
right though the talk about things up to

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,700
that point but that's the best giving

66
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,260
from my standpoint

67
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,979
in contrast Attorney General Sessions

68
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:07,379
you meet people meet what aggravates and

69
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:10,169
even beyond that is we got a letter from

70
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,469
him because if he wants to go at the

71
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,979
babies

72
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:18,439
get a letter from them and the letter

73
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:20,449
signed by the Attorney General to watch

74
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,919
to take myself the government in which

75
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:24,349
she's very critical of Washington

76
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,329
State's utilization of marijuana okay he

77
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:28,939
has a disagreement I understand that but

78
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,430
the part that's so frustrating in that

79
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,650
letter he literally is making things

80
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,420
like oh there's a problem I think that

81
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,800
it's great market brought together your

82
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,500
medical and recreational marijuana

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,939
systems he cites made reported there's

84
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,000
just a problem that report is a years

85
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:45,530
old and such pointed to to never record

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
of course the state legislature who

87
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,400
brought those systems together these

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,870
employees Dannette or what grow the

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,090
better for him is employees how do you

90
00:03:52,870 --> 00:04:00,319
handle it i candidly it's hard to take

91
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:02,330
someone seriously the signs of erratic

92
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,039
unite right it's hard to take someone

93
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,290
seriously I want to be intellectually

94
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:09,349
understand what actually is happening in

95
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:11,239
a system that he purports to change so

96
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,400
that wasn't the only no me nervous

97
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,200
statements with Max that he just was it

98
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,090
was riddled balloons so the government

99
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,889
wrote a very very detailed letter back

100
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,988
builders check it out because August of

101
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,699
this year that you know was maybe a bit

102
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,259
more candid I would typically right

103
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,478
through the city US attorney kiddo but I

104
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:28,849
held things having said right things had

105
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:35,478
to be said so this did not only come as

106
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:39,710
a surprise it happened yesterday his

107
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:41,870
views on marijuana or very clear and I

108
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:45,228
just a couple points about what came out

109
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,910
so what we're surprised to is the lucky

110
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:48,228
mountainous fellow as you know it's very

111
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,740
very for you right now

112
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:53,180
linkie doc it's very very brief and it's

113
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,829
something that been crafted by numerous

114
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,310
team in 25 minutes it's not a

115
00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:00,379
complicated document right well in fact

116
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,180
the : random the argument I'll talk

117
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:02,600
about the positive as well as just a

118
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,620
peasant

119
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,230
attention to this important event

120
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,600
marijuana front but it's it's not a

121
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,250
detailed work product I guess I have a

122
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,860
surprise once he decided to do something

123
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,329
that this was what he did if it wasn't

124
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,120
more to it basically I'm not minimizing

125
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:19,099
at all what he did deeply disappointing

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,990
deeply troubling what do you ex are

127
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,780
long-term remain to be seen they'll talk

128
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:30,290
about that my perspective but since it's

129
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:32,089
been a whole year a specific step at

130
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,310
launching state to stop watching state

131
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:37,219
moving forward right what you did for us

132
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,600
to say hey use all US Attorney's you've

133
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,990
got the discretion basically do what you

134
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,990
think is appropriate

135
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,910
the other part that surprised me but

136
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,750
rolling back to Pullman grant which of

137
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,730
course was upon administration that said

138
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,829
he states like Colorado Washington which

139
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,439
is legalized that time it's essentially

140
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:59,120
an uneasy truce basically he's

141
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,189
essentially they're communicating you

142
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,899
can move forward and just make sure

143
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:05,990
marijuana up in the hands of minors

144
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:07,339
right economy state borders reasonable

145
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,079
request we can work with the benefit

146
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:12,079
when we have for a number of years now

147
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,939
so here if you eliminated outright you

148
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,529
took that that that nice that were

149
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,540
essentially it's a low priority to the

150
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:19,609
defrost marijuana pieces but he also

151
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,960
foot building later has always told will

152
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,970
read the footnotes very carefully right

153
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,620
in a footnote he mentions the object at

154
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,660
random in 2009 which many of you

155
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,430
probably know is a memorandum that

156
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,530
applied to medical marijuana in which

157
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,329
the department justice said to US

158
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:34,369
attorneys it's literally two metal rivet

159
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:36,259
US Attorney's post prosecute to stuff on

160
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,240
the ground all around the country great

161
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:40,490
and given a lot of the port of the US

162
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,350
Attorney's I'll get mental the better

163
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,420
with the Department jezus said was

164
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,490
becomes a medical marijuana in states

165
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,900
that legalized medical marijuana

166
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,810
marijuana

167
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:52,879
2880 or 29 when I thank you 29 states

168
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,500
I'd be blessed marijuana they said

169
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,360
selling a cancer patient is using

170
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,569
medical marijuana in one of those states

171
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,430
that is not a priority three exact words

172
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,560
the member was essentially saying yeah

173
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,389
no we're not focusing on that someone

174
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,000
business state has little marijuana it's

175
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,129
using it that's not your party the other

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,660
things to worry about

177
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,969
session says mental yesterday took that

178
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,470
back as well which I don't think people

179
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,090
fully appreciate right now around

180
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:21,200
there's so much going on right I'm not

181
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:23,439
sure that was the focus as much as take

182
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,839
back the clothing brand but what that's

183
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:30,170
again disturbing to be on on many many

184
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,029
levels so you know we're gonna go from

185
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,660
here I guess it's all things one days

186
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:36,889
happened becoming Attorney General my

187
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:42,230
staff will close with this

188
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:43,579
aptly turn to in Colorado because we're

189
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,860
the two states that legalize marijuana

190
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,089
we met all time at the conferences or a

191
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,680
staff spot all the time

192
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:50,269
[ __ ] leg create a workgroup those

193
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,889
states that have legalized marijuana the

194
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,569
AG's of states that have legalized

195
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,209
marijuana or one nothing like marijuana

196
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:58,389
and that's been a group that's been here

197
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,979
helping out where I guess five years

198
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,169
which we discuss all sorts of issues

199
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,120
related to the legalization of marijuana

200
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,720
from the legal standpoint of defending

201
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,560
the will the voters rate internally

202
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,500
my team has been preparing for something

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,870
like this happen for five years so we're

204
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,790
not highest one obsessed you we're not

205
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,970
hot flat-footed our arguments are

206
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,530
prepared we have contemplated

207
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,210
hypothetical scenarios in which the

208
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,159
little voters would be ported or

209
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:30,549
attempted to be ported by the federal

210
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,550
government

211
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:34,240
[Music]

212
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:15,139
like I piece it over the phone all right

213
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:20,630
now with them all each piece is

214
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:22,069
obviously different but the way I do my

215
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:24,439
job is very simple

216
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,930
I try to stay focused on my lane of my

217
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,390
responsibilities I can't do anything

218
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:31,849
that was a lot of Commerce okay I can

219
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:33,799
write letters to members of Congress and

220
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,060
he do something tell the banking

221
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,679
industry when it comes to the

222
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,599
legalization marijuana we sent those

223
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,189
letters we communicate up in a DC at

224
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,769
militants congressional delegation to

225
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,300
communicate my views on that okay but

226
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,970
I'm not any Congress I don't have that

227
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:50,990
hope that's not my ass on my lane right

228
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:53,990
write a letter so it you write but what

229
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,990
I can do my role is very specific

230
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,970
our job is to defend this piece of

231
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,500
Washington state law whether it's occupy

232
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,960
the state legislature or adopted by the

233
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,990
people through the initiative process

234
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:09,530
that's very important that when it comes

235
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:12,710
to it's critical and so we take that I

236
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,509
take that very very seriously to thing

237
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,850
the whole the voters each and every time

238
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,470
so just so you know the folks who work

239
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,540
on this they are the best attorneys in

240
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,769
the office or working these issues they

241
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,879
are the best attorneys the ottoman

242
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,710
support on this issue

243
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,539
I get where you can turn them to all the

244
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,879
time and have three years when comes to

245
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:29,899
marijuana legalization in part because

246
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,639
it's so important to the people who

247
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,139
passed it right in London in part

248
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,149
because it's you do patient support the

249
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,059
state of Washington right or the bottom

250
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:39,289
or cannabis or we do them legal advice

251
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:40,939
it's all sorts of issues that are out

252
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:42,500
there we need to be on top of our being

253
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,670
that comes with this in terms of the

254
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,570
future what's going to happen I've been

255
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:46,309
asked that a lot lately

256
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:52,550
I don't know that anymore than use your

257
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:53,689
brain but what could happen Washington

258
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:55,399
may be different than other states

259
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,920
because what Attorney General Sessions

260
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:01,990
has done is essentially said to those

261
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,339
mobile US attorneys you have discretion

262
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,779
do what you think is appropriate I'm

263
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,090
paraphrasing but that's essentially what

264
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,439
the memorandum said well you know

265
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,610
Governor Isaac spoke about this

266
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,170
yesterday that press conference we

267
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,509
headed some at some length quite

268
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:16,490
passionately where he said basically a

269
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:18,500
nobody attorney could walk down the

270
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,060
streets of Washington State trying to

271
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,220
shut down here a lot of things the

272
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:25,899
people spoken there and what they want

273
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,910
we have a system is google poll right

274
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:30,819
have a lot of authority but I do think

275
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:34,389
that you know US attorneys are aware of

276
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,070
what they serve in many figures and they

277
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:38,799
have a lot of discretion and how what

278
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,129
they choose I would submit mutations out

279
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,759
before those attorneys ones maybe 25 in

280
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:58,299
the future is to emphasize things we

281
00:11:45,759 --> 00:12:00,610
have a system okay people spent all day

282
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:01,959
right I've been when I focused on will

283
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,149
be like every other we haven't

284
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,560
understatement rate to people not every

285
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:09,039
day investing on average peasant

286
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:11,289
motivated people like they didn't

287
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,778
Washington state alone right there were

288
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:17,079
men old boy describe it it's a 2012 we

289
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:19,570
have a year old boys cry 2012 man woman

290
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,790
and child in our state alone at the 16

291
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,770
day supply

292
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:24,278
suddenly camp says no doesn't make any

293
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:26,049
sense

294
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,350
well we do something about that right

295
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:31,419
when we focus our energies on that so

296
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,370
that's the conversation all be having

297
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,750
right with the US Attorney's Eastern

298
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,149
District of Washington and the West

299
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,730
rotisserie from Washington but boldly is

300
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,429
up to them both should communicate to

301
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,470
them but they have a program to do that

302
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,179
right they're not elected official is

303
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,690
there a point but there are human beings

304
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:52,528
they're lawyers or smart people they

305
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,529
care about what you think

306
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,429
there is one ratio Hedgehog that's not

307
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:00,340
sex related before I have to get on

308
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:02,319
press your comments it is important in

309
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,170
Washington State setting side of the

310
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,970
session situation controversial one as

311
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:09,219
well as some respects less health other

312
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,009
states but the issue of whether not

313
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,590
local jurisdictions can ban and sell

314
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:17,080
marijuana can a city in a county and the

315
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,030
sale of marijuana and when our

316
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,710
initiative passed there was a lot of

317
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:22,179
questions around them because all the

318
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,310
jurisdictions started banning is health

319
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:26,409
care law you simply say if you ask

320
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,629
everyone you can't you can't do that and

321
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:30,759
so my office is asking about legal

322
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,950
opinion about them my legal pants are

323
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,500
not finding any important potentially

324
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,690
guidance in after or businesses but

325
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,309
court ultimate resolved now when we

326
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,810
issue a legal opinion our track records

327
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:42,759
pretty good we put a lot of fun of those

328
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:44,949
Attorney General's signed off on those

329
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,750
my sister general for selling me you

330
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,520
know there's some chart people attend

331
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,379
those but there are opinions for

332
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,970
guidance so we were asked to do that I

333
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,789
wanted sighs those are not policy

334
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,860
positions we're not massive we were not

335
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:58,059
asked to say is it a good idea if local

336
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,589
jurisdictions ban the sale of marijuana

337
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:02,529
that's how the question I'm asking

338
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:05,440
answering the question Hanson is legally

339
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:07,059
legally do local jurisdictions have we

340
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,070
how about demand axilla marijuana that's

341
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,569
the legal question I'm answering the

342
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,089
answer that question this is a few years

343
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:21,100
ago down was a yes into of the authority

344
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:23,350
of the or so so couple things without

345
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,970
too much of a legal side of it but at a

346
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,860
high level any most folks grasp

347
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,110
intuitively that both jurisdictions have

348
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,389
a lot of course granted authority by the

349
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,730
state pays coming

350
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,379
Nelson we set rules regulations as we

351
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,560
see a program or closest to people

352
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:40,889
that's how it works except right local

353
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,409
jurisdictions can be bound right or

354
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,509
limited by the state but only if the

355
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:47,129
state is very explicit about that in

356
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,779
other words the state has to say to the

357
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:51,720
legislature for the initiative process a

358
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:54,629
local jurisdictions you must do X or you

359
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,759
cannot do Y has to be very very explicit

360
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:58,649
Hamilton is what we call lots of cases

361
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,450
about this has its take pre-emptive

362
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,610
local jurisdictions from the usual

363
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,129
Boarding they have what they want

364
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,870
we read the initiative it's not

365
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,200
complicated if the initiative and had a

366
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:12,049
simple sense of saying all jurisdictions

367
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:17,030
must provide like a sailor marijuana

368
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:20,549
period that's fancy that's pinchy

369
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:23,639
initially does not say that doesn't say

370
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:26,699
that might be was I think it's a good

371
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,799
policy I'm saying legal aid well maybe

372
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,210
this assignment on that therefore local

373
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,129
jurisdictions retain their operated

374
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,740
always have now this has been important

375
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:36,450
since we started in 1990 edges around

376
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,549
the state have waited on that all I

377
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,690
haven't read my analysis both of

378
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:40,139
jurisdictions can ban the sale of

379
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,920
marijuana

380
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,659
I just Google this morning breaking down

381
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:48,269
california allows the ban and local

382
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:49,620
jurisdictions Alaska Oregon Colorado I

383
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,809
think every statements legalize has a

384
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,370
bad word there's a reason for that

385
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:56,219
two month commitment here's what is it's

386
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,440
important one so import local

387
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,060
jurisdictions are sued by a business

388
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,340
owner who wants to sell marijuana and

389
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,529
accountant ersity has placed a ban the

390
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,480
local jurisdiction has a too hard it's

391
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:08,579
like go to court as it's really for the

392
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,720
first one is let Burke's a guy who Frank

393
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,090
okay

394
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,930
the initiative doesn't preempt our usual

395
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,509
Authority

396
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:17,819
okay so this is what versus Eddie's

397
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:19,860
right we have our usual or whatever we

398
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,930
want and that's what we're doing but

399
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,310
they say in the alternative that's wrong

400
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:27,989
if purposing is wrong initiative does

401
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:29,549
preclude us from and silver want they

402
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,818
have an alternative argument the

403
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:34,988
alternate arm is

404
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:37,178
a federal law look at the federal law a

405
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:42,038
federal law on marijuana

406
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:43,988
the federal law preempts state law now

407
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:45,578
what they need to get that argument it

408
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:46,600
have no courts got that part of it yet

409
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,138
because they've all agreed that I'm

410
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,509
right

411
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,428
local decisions and and sell their money

412
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,379
so the courts haven't reached determine

413
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:55,178
whether or not federal a lot of them

414
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,069
state law view that wasn't ruching about

415
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:58,688
that is if it's that argument the

416
00:16:57,068 --> 00:17:01,088
important things or are speak two

417
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:02,708
important things and both we this is go

418
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,179
to the US Supreme Court you can decide

419
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:07,599
for yourself comment will give you the

420
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:09,819
USB port designers question does federal

421
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,009
law and state law that would just be a

422
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:13,509
local band that's an essential thread of

423
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:15,878
legalization marijuana not just in

424
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:17,459
Washington at all across the country the

425
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:20,349
only way to avoid that conversation

426
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,370
before the Austrian Court is if each

427
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:26,259
state allows or bubble bands some ironic

428
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:29,109
somewhat ironically local bands actually

429
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:31,298
my new preserve the legalization

430
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:33,638
marijuana if any state those courts it's

431
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:35,259
built you've got to do it it's only a

432
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:37,178
matter of time before that issue of

433
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:38,710
whether federal law and state law ends

434
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,740
up squarely before the US Supreme Court

435
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,778
we would be you know I just put that out

436
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,339
there now that was not a reason for our

437
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:46,750
decision I want to be clear we're just

438
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:48,730
look at the initiative the language of

439
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,829
the issues at language make flavor

440
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,528
although jurisdictions must Anna sell

441
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:55,839
marijuana we would've said an answer but

442
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:57,519
it does not so we'll see that piece has

443
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,439
not got none of those pieces got our

444
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,799
state to be poor yet retention someone

445
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,509
surprised me

446
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,759
so this issue may end up a little fans

447
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,869
before speech in court but whatever they

448
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,579
say it's not mutual

449
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:10,649
ex-girlfriend just write articles

450
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:12,059
morning states provide that and I'm

451
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,200
convinced there's a reason why they

452
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:38,609
specifically provided so just to wrap up

453
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:41,100
you know it's a prison actually if you

454
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:42,750
ask what single issue I spend the most

455
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,189
time as Attorney General thinking about

456
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,710
it would have been there along in

457
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,350
position because it impacts so much of

458
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,690
state government right such importance

459
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:53,339
to people so high profile the meet

460
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,410
unique media's interesting it's just

461
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:56,819
it's a big big big issue right I mean

462
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,009
geez you're asking about it's a big big

463
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,569
issue and it's one of the few issues I

464
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,750
was saying we're a little early receive

465
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:05,909
regular memos updating me on court

466
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,380
actions are on the stage and issues with

467
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,779
state care attendant liquor and cannabis

468
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,190
do you get a guy here hello Trump

469
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,629
becoming president pasta this year has

470
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,370
been a big focus on our litigation with

471
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,810
the president but I would say the issue

472
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:18,419
of marijuana legalization you know my

473
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,220
team knows this is this is critical to

474
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,310
me personally I think to our office and

475
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,170
so we're going to do everything in our

476
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:27,389
power and everything in my power to pull

477
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,769
the wool voters a that's our job be I

478
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,390
think is the right thing to do

479
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:34,569
see I think women

480
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:36,870
I think part of his head I felt they

481
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:39,250
were most vulnerable the first year

482
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:41,469
about her most vulnerable to the first

483
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,720
year I'm thankful that President Obama

484
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,548
and Eric Holder held their respect

485
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,019
classes the first year we feel like the

486
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:48,910
marijuana instead of visiting the first

487
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,429
year I think thinks they're that

488
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:54,580
different man Justin cannon right so the

489
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,890
fact that we had those five years come

490
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:58,839
for other states at maja war that was

491
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,360
six on them right this is all in one

492
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,668
direction we have this pilots in five

493
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,529
years to be a lot more students in ten

494
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:08,799
years more states bill it's all about

495
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:10,359
compression and I think people

496
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,069
understand that and I think that worth

497
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,109
