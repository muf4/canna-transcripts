1
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:21,359
tonight's demo is from Jeff Church also

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,700
known globally as Canada's Reverend Jeff

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,739
has mastered every modern extraction

4
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,439
technique and most of the ancient ones

5
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,168
he has travelled the world to both learn

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,179
exotic techniques as well as spread

7
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:36,899
modern techniques from the United States

8
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:39,329
he is a longtime patient advocate from

9
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,308
way back he has been in the front of the

10
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,590
laws helping humans get relieved since

11
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:46,468
the very early days here in Washington

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,649
Jeff is presently an extractor and hash

13
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,160
maker at 5:02 processor puffin farms and

14
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,609
he continues to consult everywhere Jeff

15
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:59,038
is absolutely one of my mentors but even

16
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,120
more so I'm really honored to call my

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:10,909
friend please welcome Jeff

18
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:13,978
[Applause]

19
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:17,729
it's awesome to see such a huge crowd

20
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:20,280
here and just just amazing so tonight

21
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:23,459
we've got ethanol hash oil along the

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,009
topic so you know a lot of you guys call

23
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,728
it at the moment a soil of people color

24
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,769
full extract canvas involve eco re so

25
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:34,170
there's a lot of different names but

26
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,759
basically what it boils down to is the

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,560
best method for the extraction and

28
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,299
that's ethanol and so that's why I

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,099
prefer to call it ethanol Nashville

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,770
rather than becasue person oil Rick

31
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:47,009
Simpson is great guy definitely helped a

32
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,810
lot of people find this oil but it has

33
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,959
nothing to do a bit at this point you

34
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,209
know and so that's where I've drawn a

35
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,920
little bit so tonight we'll make ethanol

36
00:01:54,209 --> 00:02:00,030
our bull I'll describe how to make

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,439
ethanol hot dog it's a flammable solvent

38
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:07,289
so we're not going to actually perform

39
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:09,389
the extraction here tonight so basically

40
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:14,039
there's there's a few different things

41
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:18,029
Vico a lot of people refer to that as a

42
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:20,280
full extract cannabis oil right so it's

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,469
a full plant you take every part of the

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,810
plant some people even the rinse of the

45
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:28,500
plant and they take that and they do an

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:32,639
ethanol extraction on it and you know a

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,639
lot of people do a warm long soak so 24

48
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,609
hours or longer from some people and you

49
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,400
end up with a really green extract

50
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:43,530
that's full of every constituent that's

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,109
in the plant and so for a lot of people

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,329
that is the medicine that's what they

53
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:52,250
want that's what they're after

54
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:55,049
for me personally I just really love I

55
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,500
love extracting the resin of the flame

56
00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:00,689
you know I'm not as into all of the

57
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,469
other constituents that are in the

58
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:05,460
plants

59
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:07,349
you know like chlorophyll I'm not really

60
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,110
interested in having that in something

61
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:14,400
that I smoke you know so so I'm more

62
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:19,410
into this quick kind of cold extraction

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,870
method so basically you've got feet oh

64
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,900
you've got quick watch quick watch is

65
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,830
kind of like a way to make a really nice

66
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,140
hash oil at home without having to use

67
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:33,000
butane you know you can do promise and

68
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,379
process is a great method as well to

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,370
make that show but if you want to use a

70
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:41,400
solvent you can take isopropyl alcohol

71
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,870
is what people used to use and I don't

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,330
recommend that anymore

73
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,060
but they have a quick iso method quizzo

74
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,400
is what people would call it and you can

75
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,909
do the same thing with ethanol with 95%

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,620
ethanol and do a quick extraction and

77
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,689
get something that's going to be nice

78
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,500
for smoking it's not gonna have much of

79
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,930
the green in there at all but you know

80
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,819
that's that's one one thing that people

81
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,250
do with it so people do this whole full

82
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,680
extracts canvas oil that's really

83
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,199
everything that's in the plant extracted

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,420
into the oil or you can do weight on the

85
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,250
other end this really quick wash that's

86
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,129
just going to get the resin heads of the

87
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:24,600
plant it's not going to contain it

88
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:27,449
everything else there's also along the

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,850
souks on flour as you can do any number

90
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,168
of things under the Sun you know with

91
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,470
ethanol which makes it a really

92
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:37,829
versatile and really easy to kind of

93
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,750
common in what process you want to based

94
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:42,300
on what your final product is going to

95
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,959
be what your final product is that you

96
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,418
desire so what you need to make ethanol

97
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,129
hash oil at home it's really simple you

98
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:55,250
need some ethanol and so this right here

99
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:56,430
is Everclear it's 95% alcohol you need a

100
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,970
beating

101
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:06,540
cannabis of course per you need a jar to

102
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:11,030
do the extraction you need a coffee

103
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,030
filter for doing a filtration

104
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:18,270
form of you know a press really works

105
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:20,399
well so this is a Taylor racer you don't

106
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:24,539
handle this right in there and press out

107
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:27,659
the last bits of the ethanol and you

108
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,730
need somewhere to store it you know a a

109
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,800
syringe works really well for ethanol

110
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,850
it's nice for dosing you can kind of see

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,449
where what amount you're actually using

112
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:43,110
and then a method of clicking the

113
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:45,839
ethanol off and a method of D carbonate

114
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,520
so for cooking the ethanol off what

115
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:53,519
we've gone to is a race paper and so the

116
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,099
rice cooker really is that perfect tool

117
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,779
for home you can run an extension cord

118
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,000
outside because none of this should ever

119
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,699
be done inside when you're cooking on

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,050
solvents in it but very interesting you

121
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:09,539
guys are gonna forget to have your house

122
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:12,180
if you do it and eventually it's let's

123
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,560
play pull the butane extraction in in

124
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,420
your kitchen but still it's not

125
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,819
something that you want to do so you can

126
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,040
run your extension cord out you can set

127
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,860
this thing up and the beauty about the

128
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,660
rice cooker is you're not gonna scorch

129
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,509
your oil because it's gonna turn off

130
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,600
before it's done you know this this is

131
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:32,639
meant to boil water so it's going to get

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,060
quite hot you know possibly up to 300

133
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,139
degrees but when it's got a it's got a

134
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,160
sensor in there

135
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,870
though they'll tell that the temperature

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,630
is spiked and they'll shut it off so the

137
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:51,079
switch gets thrown so so what what I go

138
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:55,649
for what I'm doing and ethanol

139
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:59,159
extraction at home is I really want just

140
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:01,379
beautiful golden picture and so you guys

141
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,200
can come and see this later so this is

142
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,800
what I made at home just in preparation

143
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:10,920
for this class so so what I like to do

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,230
is freeze the material and the ethanol

145
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,569
overnight so I like the deep freezer

146
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,160
this is colder than my you know freezer

147
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,490
that I've got with all the rest of my

148
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,110
food at home the deep freezer gets that

149
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,210
ethanol to that perfect temperature

150
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,870
where you definitely still pour it it's

151
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:29,819
not syrup Gerrits it's not like really

152
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,160
slushy you know which if you use like

153
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:36,269
dried ice to chill it and get into that

154
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,240
slushy kind of territory and so you put

155
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:43,409
it in there overnight then you take and

156
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:47,340
pour your ethanol over your cannabis and

157
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,439
I prefer not to kinda I don't want the

158
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,689
green that's inside of it all of the

159
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,339
resin is on the outside of the plant

160
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,019
material and the ethanol is going to

161
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,560
saturate through it and the extraction

162
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:00,629
of period that I'm doing if I ground it

163
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,530
my yield would probably be a little bit

164
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:06,209
better but better of what it would be

165
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,699
full of other constituents that are

166
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:10,019
inside the cell walls when when you

167
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,990
break the plant material you're

168
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:15,299
extracting what's exposed and so it's

169
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,460
not really what I'm aiming for some

170
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,790
people really like to have that green

171
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:23,430
hash oil for for eating and you know

172
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,840
that's that's a great method you would

173
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,970
definitely want to grind it if that was

174
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:33,600
the case so right just using buds yes I

175
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,399
used flowers for this they were actually

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,610
some old flowers that I just happen to

177
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,750
have around

178
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:46,570
somehow wasn't his folks it was it was a

179
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:48,370
perfect extraction that material so you

180
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,620
pour the ethanol over the material and

181
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,409
put it right back into the freezer and

182
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,259
let it soak for three hours and so

183
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:58,689
that's kind of the quick extraction

184
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:00,879
timeframe that you can get into to the

185
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,860
deep freeze and not have to worry about

186
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,990
I could probably extend that to five

187
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,639
hours if I really want to it and I have

188
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,830
to worry about too much of chlorophyll

189
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,958
being extracted but three hours I just

190
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:14,740
really like that number it seems to

191
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:17,619
always work well for people on the other

192
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,919
hand definitely will go for a 24 hour or

193
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:24,009
even one month long soaks if they're

194
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:27,759
really trying to fully digest every last

195
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:31,000
bit of what is in the cannabis plant but

196
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,730
to each their own you know I really love

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,409
hashish like I said so so I'm more on

198
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:40,300
the resin side of it rather than the

199
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:45,009
plant material side of it sure we will

200
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:48,729
talk about tea card I didn't yeah

201
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:51,309
there's definitely you know if you d

202
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,778
card some people say it's easier to

203
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:54,429
perform the extraction you're going to

204
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:56,559
get a more complete extraction I feel

205
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:58,509
like ethanol such a great solvent that

206
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,250
it gets the majority of what I'm going

207
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:03,309
after anyways he'll think it's really

208
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:07,570
necessary to D carpet and I really like

209
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:10,000
a acid form teacher and so in the acid

210
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,730
form teacher you're going to have all of

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,220
your terpene content there if you

212
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,570
haven't d carved your material for the

213
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,500
extraction so that's one thing to think

214
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,420
put your goal to smoke or to eat it's to

215
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,490
have a versatile oil that you can use

216
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:28,519
for it's going to be high in

217
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,339
cannabinoids so this stuff here was D

218
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,419
card so with the intention of eating but

219
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:37,399
it's very small so yeah it's something

220
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:39,588
and you know it could have more terpenes

221
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,509
in it if I didn't department it would

222
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,209
have tasted a lot better I could have

223
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:46,490
gone with a more gentle approach to it

224
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:49,899
but I went and put some heat on there

225
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:52,879
and and make sure the D part so now that

226
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:56,809
what most people are looking for an

227
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,028
ethanol hash oil for at this point is to

228
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:02,149
eat you know a lot of people are after

229
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:04,129
the RSO or the Zico for a cancer

230
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,110
Richmond you know and so that's that's

231
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:09,198
really you know where they go but you

232
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,360
can definitely make that with a quick

233
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:13,399
extraction you don't have to have all

234
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,269
those other constituents in there they

235
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:20,600
may play key roles to have to you know

236
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:23,230
to the healing but the cannabinoids

237
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,170
themselves have all been shown to help

238
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,269
cancer you know so it's kind of I'm not

239
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:38,509
sure what part of the plant really is is

240
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:40,459
healing us I just know that okay so the

241
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,769
point of reason the economic for is to

242
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:45,439
lower the temperature extraction so the

243
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,679
plant material is frozen the ethanol is

244
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,959
frozen then when you combine the two

245
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:53,239
certain constituents aren't dissolvable

246
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:56,359
like chlorophyll chlorophyll is not

247
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,089
resolvable freezing temperature or it's

248
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,620
not as readily dissolve so over time

249
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,389
you're still gonna get chlorophyll to

250
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,209
extract if you leave it in the freezer

251
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:07,850
for long enough but but starting cold

252
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:11,359
allows you not to have these undesired

253
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,649
constituents that come over yes so

254
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,089
please hold your questions in the end

255
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,489
Jeff's got a lot to do it

256
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,229
so all the questions write it down we'll

257
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:22,829
definitely talk questions at the end

258
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:26,819
here question so you freeze the material

259
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:31,078
for three hours and then what I like to

260
00:12:26,818 --> 00:12:37,228
do is just a simple coffee filter I put

261
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:42,019
it into the jar and then I fold over

262
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:44,158
most of it but leave just a little bit

263
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:47,038
unattached there so this there's an

264
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:50,129
airflow so there's this a space for

265
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:54,658
airflow in here so then then you just

266
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:56,879
take your your cannabis and and ethanol

267
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:58,438
and you pour it right on over over it

268
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,869
and then I'll take after everything's

269
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:04,558
poured out of it I take and put the

270
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:06,839
plant material in here and it's kind of

271
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:08,578
hard to squeeze right here like this and

272
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,909
one prop that I didn't bring tonight

273
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:14,368
it's a nice two cup measuring cup a

274
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:16,438
glass measuring cup and you can just

275
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:18,119
kind of set it on there and get your

276
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:20,748
squeeze going and not really lose

277
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:23,668
anything and then pour that into the cup

278
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:27,058
you break through the filter and so this

279
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:29,369
right here is the filtered extract you

280
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:32,009
guys can all it be in the event come up

281
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:33,389
here open it up and smell if you'd like

282
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:34,829
to you can actually smell some of the

283
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:37,198
dirt means it's really heavy with

284
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:39,748
alcohol so it's hard to smell but and

285
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:44,098
then this is this is the final coil over

286
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:46,709
here the wash but so you take this after

287
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:50,930
it's filtered and you put it into the

288
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:53,929
rice cooker flip the switch on and

289
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:57,109
within about half an hour with the lid

290
00:13:53,929 --> 00:14:00,049
on all of the ethanol for the most part

291
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:03,169
most of the ethanol I should say is gum

292
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:05,389
and it still has quite a bit to our

293
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:08,329
beans in there there's a little bit left

294
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:12,769
it's not very well dee carbonate anyway

295
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:16,820
so at that point you have a couple

296
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:21,169
options if you just have the rice cooker

297
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:24,589
you can take and push down on the switch

298
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:26,629
a little bit and ill pop right back up

299
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:28,850
so just hold it for like two seconds and

300
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:31,610
then let it back up and then do it again

301
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:35,089
and repeat until you start to see the

302
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:37,789
oil form little bubbles and so when it

303
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,800
forms the little bubbles you stop as the

304
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:42,139
boiling starts to slow back down you can

305
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:45,139
do that process again and then continue

306
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:48,019
that until the boiling has finished and

307
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:51,019
that's that's an easy way to deke art

308
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:53,990
it's not the most elegant it's going to

309
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,850
destroy some of the THC in your next

310
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,250
rack but it's going to get you Adi

311
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,310
carpet product without having to go

312
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,690
through a lot of extra hassle so if

313
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:06,169
you're if you're just trying to make it

314
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:09,560
a quick easy extract you can go there if

315
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:15,588
you want to take it one step further you

316
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:18,649
can have a pot on a hot plate with oil

317
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:22,730
in it and you keep that boil up use a

318
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:24,980
candy thermometer - 250 260 degrees

319
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,490
somewhere in that range and you take

320
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,430
your oil the rice cooker and pour it

321
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,919
into a jar well it's still warm so it's

322
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:37,969
easy to get out of there and then set it

323
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:40,759
in this in the pot of oil and D carbon

324
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:46,399
that way and so that's gonna take you

325
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:49,730
know anywhere from 20 minutes if you

326
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,470
focused a very small amount of oil 20

327
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,409
minutes from the time the oil reaches

328
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,778
that tutor

329
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:57,838
these 260 degrees also take a few

330
00:15:54,778 --> 00:16:00,328
minutes for it to warm up up to a couple

331
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,610
hours if you have a large amount of oil

332
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:06,559
there a 450 curve then you can watch it

333
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:10,980
boil of what's boiling off is ethanol

334
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:14,008
terpenes and carbon dioxide so when the

335
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:18,259
carboxylic acid is is broken by the heat

336
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:22,050
of the teach the acid turns into TC

337
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:24,449
delta-9 and so that's that's kind of you

338
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:27,688
know the D car process during that

339
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:30,448
process co2 is produced so it's just

340
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:34,409
it's broken off and you know that when

341
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:38,008
the slowing of the bubbling happens the

342
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:46,230
majority of your of your extract has

343
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:49,079
been D carved or not too little but in

344
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:53,188
in this pot you'll know that your heat

345
00:16:49,078 --> 00:17:00,870
is is pretty much break so then from

346
00:16:53,188 --> 00:17:03,179
there C so that's from there you've got

347
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:06,058
a few different options you can put your

348
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:09,029
extract into a jar it would be really

349
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:13,019
hard when you try to get it out so it's

350
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:15,240
not the ideal container for it to be

351
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:18,240
warming up that jar then trying to scoop

352
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:22,230
a little bit out I really like to pack

353
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,390
it into syringes because they are kind

354
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,338
of the easiest way to do something you

355
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,759
know you can see how much you just

356
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:32,308
dispensed see get an idea of how much

357
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,900
how many milligrams of cannabinoids

358
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:36,569
you're getting in your system if you

359
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,870
have a rough idea of what your extract

360
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:42,839
is which something but this method is

361
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:47,308
probably gonna be like a 60% cannabinoid

362
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:50,009
content at least if you do a cold

363
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:52,230
extraction and you can definitely get

364
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:54,750
higher than that but if you soak it for

365
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,849
longer you're gonna get lower than that

366
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,759
for sure

367
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:01,789
you know probably this mom one-month

368
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:03,230
soak would get you like a 30% depending

369
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,029
on what your starting material is could

370
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,630
he be in more than that that's really

371
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:10,430
really bad at starting material but but

372
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,910
yeah so I really like these syringes and

373
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:18,440
and we've been using is actually glass

374
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:20,660
on glass syringes and so the glass it

375
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,210
doesn't react with any terpenes it's not

376
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,590
going to be broken down so there's not

377
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:30,259
much terpene content left in Indy car

378
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:32,359
boy because you've cooked a lot of those

379
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,859
off during the deeper process but

380
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,529
there's definitely some left in there

381
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:39,349
too it means our solvents so passing it

382
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:41,809
into glass it's much better than packing

383
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:45,049
it into something that has any type of

384
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:47,149
plastic so Pilon and and any type of

385
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:52,329
plastic is going to absorb those

386
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,330
terpenes and give off plasticizers I

387
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:57,920
mean we enough of them already with all

388
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,920
the food that we eat that's packed in

389
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,240
plastic so probably the best to stay

390
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,170
away from it if you're making yourself

391
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,180
medicine so that's the the first way to

392
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:11,720
do it is to pack it into a syringe or a

393
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,060
jar and do it while it's hot right out

394
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,940
of the rice cooker or if it's already in

395
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,769
jars or pinch bother you you're you're

396
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,529
ready to write up to the detox process

397
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:24,440
it's the easiest way the oil is going to

398
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:27,710
be so thick that when you get it into

399
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,420
the syringe you literally can't i'm you

400
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,069
know i push on the syringe and there's

401
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,009
no motion there at all

402
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,230
so to dispense out of these syringes you

403
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:38,930
would just put it into a cup of hot

404
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,089
water or rather than the hot water and

405
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,450
the sink and that's that's one way to

406
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:47,089
get the pure pure oil out another route

407
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:50,390
that's really popular is to had some

408
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:52,759
sort of viscosity agent one way or

409
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,460
another so a lot of people use hemp seed

410
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,259
oil

411
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,470
MCT medium train-track you'll attract

412
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:04,099
which is a fractionated coconut oil is a

413
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,350
really popular one for people to add and

414
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:08,029
you can mix that in when it's hot and

415
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:09,919
then once you've loaded into the

416
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:12,139
syringes then you'll be able to squirt

417
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,850
it right out of the syringe and eat it

418
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,330
on the go without having to heat it at

419
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,819
all

420
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:20,089
so and it'll also help with the

421
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:22,909
absorption into your body so some people

422
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:24,980
really like to eat the oil just Rob

423
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,720
without having anything added to it some

424
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,180
people like to have something added to

425
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:40,250
it to help carry it into the body and

426
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:42,860
carry the syringe so I think that's

427
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,130
that's pretty much that's an all hash

428
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:49,219
oil from cannabis into the syringe it's

429
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,680
really an easy method of extraction so

430
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,319
you guys have some questions I'd love to

431
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:59,900
answer

432
00:20:53,319 --> 00:21:01,789
yeah sure it depends on the purity of

433
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,560
your teeth you know so it's all about

434
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,509
your starting material what what did you

435
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:07,519
put in for cannabinoids you're going to

436
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:09,799
get out a lesser amount such as those

437
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,509
maybe some left in your material but

438
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,809
that's pretty much what you're going to

439
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,809
get out

440
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,720
yeah

441
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,289
well okay so so it's really hard to kind

442
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,630
of nail that down I think that it's it's

443
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:36,849
gonna be dependent on your illness that

444
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,540
you're trying to take it for that's

445
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:42,909
really the big thing I know that a very

446
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:46,329
popular thing that people are doing is

447
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:50,070
the 60 and 90 days so they'll try to get

448
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:53,289
60 grams a full extract cannabis oil in

449
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:57,220
90 days and so you start off with a

450
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:58,899
grain of rice besides those and that

451
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,269
seems to be what pretty much everybody

452
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,180
can tolerate it might be a little bit

453
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:06,009
much for for inexperienced users but a

454
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,140
grain of rice seems to be about right

455
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:10,269
you can start with half that if you're

456
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,440
really an experienced and then move your

457
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:17,829
way up to a gram of day at the end of 90

458
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,140
days so it'll take 60 grams to get you

459
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:21,939
90 days and that seems to be a popular

460
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,210
treatment I'm not a doctor I really

461
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,700
don't I can't save that's what's gonna

462
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,529
cure 80 but not you know but it seems to

463
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,299
be a perfect popular thing that people

464
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:43,149
are claiming to have really good success

465
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:46,659
with right so I mean you you can still

466
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,700
take to material down to a testing lab

467
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,980
so if you made a batch of oil here in

468
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,250
Washington state like I'm pretty sure

469
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,049
the analytical 360 would test your oil

470
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,509
for me so just go down through this see

471
00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:00,639
how the location are and they'll they'll

472
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:03,190
do it and then you know how many

473
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,870
milligrams are in how much and you'd be

474
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,200
able to do so yourself by milligrams if

475
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:10,389
you want but most people don't have labs

476
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:15,460
like that you know have access to that

477
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:17,230
so we're lucky here yeah yes to respond

478
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,600
to the first question about using Keith

479
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,880
who's been my experience what advantage

480
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,879
we're using keep over flower' you

481
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,710
already have the trichomes and all of

482
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,440
this is a method of strip mining what's

483
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,960
on the outside when you lose key you

484
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,269
don't have plant material chlorophyll

485
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,340
isn't such a big deal you get gold a lot

486
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:39,160
easier and there's less need to

487
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:41,048
winterize because it's less fat to pull

488
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,730
out all those waxes right you can do the

489
00:23:41,048 --> 00:23:44,379
extraction hot and not have to worry

490
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,470
against a chlorophyll as long as the

491
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:54,280
Keith wasn't too green right yeah even

492
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:57,279
so the tops stuff but the rest of that

493
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,139
seven is largely trichomes even broken

494
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,210
and drop the issue of a lot of

495
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,070
chlorophyll and you can be a little

496
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,100
longer and warmer in yours

497
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:09,548
not just in sunny Los excuse me just

498
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:11,859
cellulose left yeah we give it a sliding

499
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,509
scale and your yield that three-hour

500
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:16,928
mark yes

501
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:20,619
so what I got here was probably two and

502
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:23,620
a half grams from an ounce so you know

503
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:27,459
it was a little less than 10% on the

504
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:30,609
yield when I make ethanol hash low for

505
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:34,120
502 we're not using flour we're using

506
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:36,759
leaf and bottom buds right so it's like

507
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,689
all the little little pieces so you know

508
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,908
if I want to

509
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,970
everything has its home you know so if

510
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:45,700
if it's good for this type of extraction

511
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:48,429
we use it over there if it's not so this

512
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,950
just happens to be where everything goes

513
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:54,220
there but we get about five percent

514
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,450
yield and we'll come up with about 60

515
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:59,420
percent cannabinoid content

516
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:03,110
the oil there as well so that's doing

517
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:05,930
the cold extraction three hours of just

518
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:08,839
a follow-up on that with the 582 how

519
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:12,710
much how much would you say your trim

520
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:15,980
goes to this type of extractions pho

521
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:19,789
well we're committed quite a bit of it

522
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:23,059
so pretty much everything you know we

523
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:26,509
moved to extracting flowers for all of

524
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:29,509
our co2 oil we have sugar leaf to make

525
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:31,609
bubble - and then pretty much everything

526
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:35,150
else like all of the things that are the

527
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:37,639
small buds and the rest of the not as

528
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,560
resin asleep but still has a tiny bit

529
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,640
you know there's a bit more shade leaf

530
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:46,069
that all goes to so a whole tier threes

531
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,170
worth is what we're processing into

532
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:50,950
ethanol

533
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:55,240
and so it's not out yet but it's coming

534
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,240
the whole mother started with

535
00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:00,759
computerize to take some other greenery

536
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:05,569
out of it so winterization is happening

537
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:07,549
with ethanol and then in a coal fire so

538
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:10,159
we're doing ethanol in a cold

539
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:12,079
environment and so the lipids that you

540
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,560
would be winterizing out of an extract

541
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,149
that's a seal to extract would not even

542
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:18,379
come out because they're going to stay

543
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,269
in the matrix they're going to stay

544
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,960
locked in there because they're the

545
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:25,910
conditions for them to be dissolved or

546
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,269
not there it's too cold and it's in

547
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:32,480
ethanol so ethanol doesn't you can't

548
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:34,400
dissolve most lipids in ethanol they can

549
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,950
flow I was worried about what you're not

550
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,850
worried but so you're looking at the 5%

551
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:43,789
water and that is all right compressed

552
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:50,009
and then we run

553
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:51,629
if you can go or not yeah I mean yeah I

554
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:53,400
don't know I wouldn't say that I'll be

555
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,040
like I think you're gonna cook off some

556
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,440
of that water in your decaf process so

557
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,509
that's that's really and actually you

558
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,670
know a lot of people used to use water

559
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:04,230
as a buffer in there D card so they

560
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,080
didn't toss them in there and they would

561
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,808
know because of how the water boiled out

562
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:13,529
when and when it was ready when it was

563
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:15,660
deeper yeah so I think that if you're d

564
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:18,000
carving it's not a big issue and I've

565
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,700
never even met my co2 winterization I've

566
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,250
never had an issue with water

567
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:27,480
except for from the smoke to process you

568
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:30,390
know we didn't extract water so yes what

569
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,710
do you think of the method of D carving

570
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:36,630
the bugs before you can use them with

571
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,390
the would have been a mason jars so that

572
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,760
the third mean supposedly stay in there

573
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,080
rather than doing that yeah I mean you

574
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,609
know there's all kinds of different ways

575
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,109
to do it and that's another another

576
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:50,129
thing that you could do you could take

577
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:55,019
this tincture even and set that into you

578
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:57,510
know a hot bat right but then you're

579
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,700
gonna have you know a closed environment

580
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:02,039
with the solvent that's that's boiling

581
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,509
away and I just I feel like you know

582
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,269
that that could be dangerous

583
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:08,220
in a home environment you know it's not

584
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,960
something I was trying to recommend yeah

585
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,970
but it's it's still impossible in the

586
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,210
terpenes if you're aiming for an alcohol

587
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,769
teacher rather than an RSO of oil you

588
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,990
could totally retain the tincture or

589
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:22,619
retain the terpenes and have the

590
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:25,620
tincture being activated but you're

591
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:30,479
going to change the terpenes from what

592
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:33,839
they were on a flower to a degraded

593
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,759
version of that just like the THC is to

594
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,379
creating down the terpenes are also

595
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,690
going to create down something you'll

596
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,880
still be present Clemens yeah

597
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,529
so Mike advice my experience not that

598
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,940
I've done this

599
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:49,430
we hope larger jar and the Bollier and

600
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,230
you need to periodically open it perfect

601
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:54,560
because the solvent will vaporize him

602
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:57,980
and you'll hear the lid pan so you want

603
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,529
to use a headspace by having a volume

604
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,990
above the liquid and burp it when it

605
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:04,940
pops yep and but then when you burp it

606
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,779
oops apply it now I understand that

607
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,779
stage

608
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:26,990
to keep the terms of heating and break

609
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:29,389
in the car all right well I mean it's

610
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,890
gonna force the terpenes out right it's

611
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,720
good for seven all it's gonna force

612
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,730
terpenes up so you'll end up with a

613
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,990
hacksaw eventually if you had the lid

614
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:41,329
off so tonight here season's question

615
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,970
right though is she might be carving the

616
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:47,329
flower and a mason jar sealed prior to

617
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:49,750
you to double right yeah so so I mean

618
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:52,519
you know you can totally do that as well

619
00:29:49,750 --> 00:30:38,429
d carbon tiny tiny laughs and then

620
00:29:52,519 --> 00:30:44,528
extract any ounce material

621
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:46,450
how much did water-pipe work for me so

622
00:30:44,528 --> 00:30:48,669
but given your mileage may be a little

623
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,159
bit different but nothing on how fluffy

624
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:53,259
is if you grind it down like I don't

625
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:58,089
suggest definitely be able to use less

626
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:59,798
ethanol but it's totally fine to grind

627
00:30:58,088 --> 00:31:02,048
it especially if you're just eating it

628
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:03,338
there ain't not smoking it get the

629
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:05,950
cannabinoid side of the plant material

630
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:08,858
and give it out in the most efficient

631
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,859
way and that would be saving you ethanol

632
00:31:08,858 --> 00:31:13,569
by grinding forget about the little bit

633
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:18,148
of green you're gonna have in there your

634
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:18,148
cost of production is lowered if you

635
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:27,849
know but it is a cost yeah so back on

636
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:31,299
the keep subject can you go into the

637
00:31:27,848 --> 00:31:33,329
ratios starting material amount to keeps

638
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:36,788
you know how much alcohol you'll need

639
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:39,728
saturated yeah you know I mean I don't

640
00:31:36,788 --> 00:31:41,919
really I haven't really recorded

641
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:44,558
anything on he's extraction about

642
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,469
ultimate really know definitively it's

643
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:50,678
just you know I would say that you're

644
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:53,558
probably going to need more ethanol than

645
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:55,028
you would work for a flower extraction

646
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:56,378
right to be able to get all the

647
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:58,719
cannabinoids because there's going to be

648
00:31:56,378 --> 00:32:01,298
a saturation flavor team so it's not

649
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:03,009
just you know cover it till like with

650
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:04,960
flour that's all you do you just cover

651
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:07,569
the flour material make sure that's all

652
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,879
in the in the alcohol and you've got the

653
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:12,338
extraction with Keith if you just

654
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:14,259
covered it that's really not enough

655
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:16,739
you're gonna have to have a lot more

656
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:22,390
ethanol to perform that extraction

657
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:24,670
double it says yeah I'm sorry yes

658
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,350
they're a bit like so now we're doing

659
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,360
all this mystery right

660
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:30,009
what do you deal with that co2 material

661
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,349
you think about going to be a general I

662
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:34,480
love it I love it so that's exactly what

663
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:36,219
happens with it so I don't perform the

664
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,990
extraction myself okay that's exactly

665
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,900
what happens with the plant material

666
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,789
it's a great method use every part of

667
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,680
the plant that you can there's going to

668
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:48,420
be something I've actually keeps

669
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:53,980
material after it was co2 extracted and

670
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:58,960
tested the key is 20% THC and so that's

671
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:01,620
great ethanol actual extraction material

672
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,319
I agree and I think that wipe them so

673
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:06,909
I'm curious about it is that we did

674
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:10,470
something similar in my brother's farm

675
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:14,650
and process back some ways and we got a

676
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:17,140
one-to-one but like a hi CDC I've never

677
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,850
chromium profile which was quite an

678
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,470
interesting you know and with your

679
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:21,939
medicine Creek analytics so I don't know

680
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,339
if that's something where you want to go

681
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,980
and check the and out enjoy differences

682
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:28,929
post rip and then maybe even the lower

683
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,839
leave if you'd like isolate the strain

684
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:35,529
variance something I've got I mean I

685
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:39,099
would say that the CBC it would be and

686
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:42,129
my you know my knowledge it's what an

687
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:45,189
easier extracting instrument then THC

688
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:47,740
acid so it's going to come over first in

689
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,200
the co2 extraction so that's what my

690
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:56,099
experience is but I mean just same kind

691
00:33:50,200 --> 00:34:00,569
of the opposite maybe the co2 or BHO

692
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:00,569
sure pho could be totally different

693
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:07,490
not exactly yeah but we had a 20% CDC

694
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,710
extract it was a co2 quick fraction that

695
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,440
we took off the very very beginning of

696
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,780
the run really and so it was yeah really

697
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:19,070
really high I think it was 40% terpenes

698
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,929
and 20% CNBC's seriously yeah you know

699
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,260
but that's not a product that's out on

700
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,260
the mark

701
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:50,479
[Applause]

702
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:53,868
you sterilized how you stare like dry

703
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:57,889
set so tri-set sterilizations up in it

704
00:34:53,869 --> 00:35:00,798
so you know I ran into this issue with

705
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:04,190
braked in the medical days and we had

706
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:10,460
some bubble hash that tested positive or

707
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:12,108
some nasty microbeads and so we're like

708
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,588
oh my gosh what's going on here and so

709
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:18,108
when you do dry step you do it cold and

710
00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:21,650
then this cold hatch gets brought out

711
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:24,108
and it collects and condenses moisture

712
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,869
from the atmosphere and you can actually

713
00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:30,920
have some issues with psoriasis having

714
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:33,680
microbes if you're doing eco or you know

715
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,509
that's an actual wouldn't eat though

716
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,649
ethanol hatch so you don't have any

717
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,969
worries about that as long as you're

718
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,639
performing to the extraction pretty

719
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:43,789
quick because ethanol can kill any of

720
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:47,719
those bacteria but if you're pressing

721
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:52,400
rosin from it it's an issue and so what

722
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:56,450
we decided to do was we did a UVC light

723
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,548
treatment right out of the tumbler so

724
00:35:56,449 --> 00:36:01,639
the moment came out of the freezer came

725
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:04,788
out the tumbler we got that hash and we

726
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:06,768
in thin layers to the UVC light

727
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:08,719
treatment to it and never had a

728
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:10,639
microbial issue with it so it basically

729
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:13,880
stopped any other microbes from being

730
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:18,710
able to bloom into that heat so I don't

731
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,320
know that's exactly BG lines are

732
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,539
available

733
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,470
a vapor lock my daughter up or very

734
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:27,599
neutral oscillations yeah you know the

735
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:29,759
13 wants to keep up a purple diversify

736
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,799
the rating they have individuals that

737
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,630
they have everyone on the Left would

738
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,400
talk to has not moved the decimal point

739
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:39,990
to the right you have 54,000 rules

740
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,920
coming out the thing don't do that you

741
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:46,049
have to have it in a nice contained

742
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,539
contain the contraption basically like

743
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,220
we build a box for our UVC light and

744
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,320
then I actually had an extension cord

745
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:56,069
going way to the other end of the lab

746
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,470
and because it's I believe is like a

747
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,510
lose elements created this there's some

748
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:03,809
nasty kind of stuff that's created when

749
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,170
the UVC light burning so I always had it

750
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:06,269
you know

751
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,849
I switch over on the end of the

752
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:10,289
extension cord switch about allowed it

753
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:13,139
for it to sit there for a little bit

754
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:15,809
came by opens it up before I was doing

755
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:17,609
stuff so Mosul it didn't take some extra

756
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:20,610
caution and yeah they sell them on

757
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:23,220
Amazon they can get up there good time

758
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:25,740
for each button switch they use the

759
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:27,959
lights at Home Depot for $18 get three

760
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:30,449
different boys put it on they walk out

761
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,369
the room push fit of site yeah

762
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:36,109
yep you act like you don't want to look

763
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:39,440
at a couple more questions anymore

764
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,440
alright that's it
