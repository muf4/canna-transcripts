[Music]

2
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:09,779
hey this is Shengo from the shaping fire

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,830
podcast and i got a good one here for

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,599
you today I was at the Washington

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,839
cannabis summit a couple of weeks ago

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,390
and they had an economic policy panel

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,699
that focused on how legal cannabis is

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,710
impacting the state as a whole and one

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,010
of the people on the panel was Toby

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,929
Patterson and he is a senior forecast

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,390
analyst for the Washington State Office

12
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,460
of Financial Management that means that

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,989
he is the guy with the crystal ball who

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,829
works for the governor and gives advice

15
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:40,169
well Toby was not consulted when the

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,378
Washington cannabis market was set up

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,609
and he just goes off during his time to

18
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:46,649
speak on the panel it's pretty

19
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,738
incredible he does not toe the state's

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,739
normal message he trashes the original

21
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,390
BOE tech numbers that the entire state

22
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:56,609
regulatory structure was based on he

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,558
goes on to explain that why the the

24
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,359
present assumptions are wrong as well

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,659
and he does it with this you know wry

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,969
sense of humor that is really rare in

27
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,469
the bureaucracy and you know I don't

28
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,890
know why this guy isn't running to LCV

29
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,959
this guy is super sharp and so um I took

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,060
the video I took of the panel and I

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,309
focused in right on Toby so it's a

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,540
little grainy but you know I just cut

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,890
out everything else since we want to

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,540
focus on what he has to say

35
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,519
and then I pulled out all the steps with

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,640
him so this is kind of like a highlights

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,408
reel of Toby Patterson at the Washington

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,030
cannabis summit from the cannabis

39
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,359
Alliance so check this guy out he's

40
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,359
awesome

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:41,590
[Applause]

42
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:43,359
Hey I also better tonight I'm not a

43
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,930
research economist the office Financial

44
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:49,060
Management the state three economists

45
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,350
that support the governor's a policy

46
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:57,329
staff and other it's a piece like the

47
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:59,069
legislators you I I work for the USDA

48
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,679
National Agricultural Statistics

49
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,508
services before I came back to

50
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:07,420
Washington I here's those in the other

51
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,990
Washington sweating and time as a

52
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,990
statistician

53
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:25,989
so my toes research economists with the

54
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,268
families pretty fun but it leads me off

55
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,090
in all sorts of different ways but I

56
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,810
also wanted to thank Walker inviting me

57
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:47,289
here and I also want to know the people

58
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:49,599
here are like really late so to the LCD

59
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:53,169
to provide economic guidance on how to

60
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:57,579
institute a working market I indicated

61
00:02:53,169 --> 00:03:01,689
that the market should find and I said

62
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:03,080
the number of consumers was unknown that

63
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:06,409
the quantity demand

64
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,570
it was some unknown member as well and

65
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:12,109
further the number of producers in the

66
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:15,319
bog produce no sign that I recommended

67
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,360
the notion that the number of producers

68
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,340
and retailers would equilibria as the

69
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,140
market matures and thus the number of

70
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,599
licenses should not have a maximum what

71
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:28,609
I said

72
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,340
several of the LCB constituents that the

73
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:37,910
table Kahili disagreed and I said hey

74
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:42,289
I'm a capitalist so they'll see be

75
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:46,269
higher than anti cannabis drug policy

76
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,269
persons that guide their economic system

77
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,590
so if I mind I was saying what a working

78
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,650
market for canvas and a reasonable

79
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,080
expectation Republic is where consumers

80
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,800
can buy a high-quality cannabis product

81
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:09,560
that is uniformed the canvas is

82
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:12,500
pesticide free and Preston so in essence

83
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,100
an orderly stable market that safe free

84
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,439
of antitrust and protections so what's

85
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,980
the problem

86
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:32,860
we did not cover recovered from the 1936

87
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:36,110
propaganda market farmers and fighters

88
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,509
is instead the convoluted password of

89
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,569
entrepreneurs equal to eat eager to

90
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:44,810
create a capitalist market and crotchety

91
00:04:41,569 --> 00:05:04,189
men wriggling based on our candid ology

92
00:04:44,810 --> 00:05:05,870
and reaching a lot so I looked at this

93
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,449
and I one of the things that always

94
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,370
intrigues me about market failure is

95
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:12,560
asymmetric information you might

96
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,319
remember like the the cigarette industry

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,990
used to say that cigarettes are actually

98
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:24,199
good for you so I thought okay

99
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,680
I'm gonna look at this from purely like

100
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,539
what do we have here what is what is

101
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,629
provided to the public to know about

102
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,000
this industry so I just looked around I

103
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:37,610
said okay well that old Seabee is is

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,589
tasked with providing some sort of

105
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:48,790
education material on marijuana cannabis

106
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:48,789
reefer whatever so I said okay whoa

107
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:57,908
I picked one subject fairly random I

108
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:59,769
said said said can't getting high

109
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:02,218
cosmetic problems and I said okay

110
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:05,168
ballistics

111
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:07,149
so I pressed on the link and it said

112
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:10,389
science-based information for the public

113
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:12,489
I said okay well that's interesting it's

114
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:16,019
produced or presented by the University

115
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,019
of Washington no offense

116
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,490
it was the alcohol and drug abuse

117
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:28,990
Institute and it says scientists think

118
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,939
that cannabis causes problems

119
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,519
remembering problems with grades and

120
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:36,159
negatively affects learning hi

121
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,769
I know it's tough there's no citations

122
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:43,050
whatsoever and it says science based

123
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:45,609
right at the top so I get a little okay

124
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:48,399
you claim science-based so where are the

125
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,259
citations and then so they look like

126
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,999
that what was this one professor that

127
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,288
used to be here and he just because I'm

128
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:55,778
one of the nice right out of the season

129
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,728
for the public did read and digest we

130
00:06:55,778 --> 00:07:01,269
just he just summarized correct there

131
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:03,158
and I say okay well that it well the

132
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:05,649
person pointed me to the National

133
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:07,598
Science Foundation or the National

134
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:10,060
Academy of Science current release maybe

135
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,338
somebody seen that's like 170 pages

136
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,009
order but I hadn't read it as a okay

137
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:19,658
well that contradicts everything that

138
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:22,270
your website says so what what is the

139
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:25,769
point is this education what is it what

140
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:25,769
are you trying to do what I never play

141
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:32,399
but so what is the purpose of this and

142
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:35,668
asymmetric

143
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,098
who's winning what why are the wider the

144
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:42,359
allegiance is still there to this

145
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:45,209
prohibition mindset what is the purpose

146
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,519
and that's something that I wondered of

147
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:51,418
you know but I look at all sorts of

148
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,788
markets been so the LCB adopted the same

149
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:56,748
provision strategy as they use for

150
00:07:53,788 --> 00:08:00,228
alcohol the same number of retail stores

151
00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:05,099
exactly that's the weather they got the

152
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:15,329
233 stores right Costco stolen okay we

153
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:20,908
need something it's enforcement of

154
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:22,800
enforcement so the woman history of

155
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:25,199
prohibition has wide cultural

156
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,009
implications you may have heard

157
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:32,250
marijuana is a very dangerous drug yet

158
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,469
this hypothesis is profoundly unproven

159
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,019
and reality is not an impressive support

160
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:40,019
of the assertion the canvases at all

161
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:43,188
dangerous though the only thing I will

162
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:47,789
say that canvas is dangerous is

163
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:48,208
enforcement right how many people have

164
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:49,980
ever seen

165
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:54,149
dying from cameras not but how many

166
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,028
people have been arrested anyways so

167
00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:02,339
what happens next up we can just see but

168
00:08:57,028 --> 00:09:03,838
I will know that in Washington the

169
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,380
latest estimates are they're about

170
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,829
11,000 direct employment jobs in the

171
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,958
cannabis industry though the wage rate

172
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:19,039
is somewhere in the mid 13th dollar an

173
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:22,339
hour range so it's seemingly I I was

174
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,459
shocked it was that low but

175
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,230
[Music]

176
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,230
you know as the black market still there

177
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:40,930
so that's kind of I'll leave you with

178
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:42,580
that sort of ambiguous question so but

179
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,439
beyond that you know what's really the

180
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,379
economic cost of prohibition I mean

181
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,780
that's why that's sort of in my mind I

182
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:53,289
was like why why are we in this sort of

183
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:55,350
lockstep of it's not it's not a free

184
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:59,469
market at all this is the small

185
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:02,110
microcosm of a few licenses which are

186
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:12,850
given a maximum number for what reason I

187
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:16,389
don't figure you mentioned you would

188
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:19,269
share your work to the LCB gotta eat but

189
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,949
did you share your report on stork at 40

190
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:22,629
or your thoughts or what you shared with

191
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,210
us let's start that and then a follow-up

192
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:27,309
to that if you don't mind if you can

193
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,259
provide your thoughts on how to expand

194
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:33,269
access without that moving the market

195
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,269
share of pre-existing retail licenses

196
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:46,240
there I talked to the LCB a few

197
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:49,270
different times and in the first

198
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,589
instance that was like at the end and

199
00:10:49,269 --> 00:11:01,439
then another instance civils at 5:02

200
00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:03,910
occurrence you know I think that they I

201
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,390
think they are made of my data so to

202
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:12,149
speak whether I said whatever I said

203
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:18,629
which I again I'm for free when I know

204
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:21,909
I'm for the free market for save I was I

205
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:25,588
was pressing them to let the market

206
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:25,588
expand as it should

207
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:32,200
been a type of way where Congress to the

208
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:38,950
market can come and Weaver's lead us

209
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:42,640
they bought business to to guide the

210
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:47,410
retail system my I I place the idea of

211
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:52,330
online with entering into a medical

212
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:53,949
perspective though if you look at like

213
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:58,028
how many how many places can you buy

214
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,600
aspirin not say that the retail

215
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:03,919
establishment

216
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,490
much but there's obviously a demand for

217
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:11,269
medical products that my mind's eye

218
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,959
should be more accessible than one of

219
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:17,929
the three stores and I recently did a

220
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:21,078
look at how how far or anyone the state

221
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:23,599
had tried to get to a you know how many

222
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:27,349
do more than 20 miles to the campus to

223
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:32,290
self publish that data yet but I will

224
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:36,649
put that out working with the Telex team

225
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:38,919
but I think that the market in my mind's

226
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,919
eye should

227
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:45,120
we're seeing and there's a lot of smoke

228
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:45,120
in there

229
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,639
you don't mind me showing it on

230
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:03,790
apologize we're at Aqaba stores and you

231
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,480
you specifically said that cab is in

232
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:09,099
other words yes you know how do we

233
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,409
adjust from here we already have

234
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:19,420
licensees go me you know we have the

235
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:22,509
other issues but we need access what you

236
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:25,149
know why in my mind it should be based

237
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,830
it should just be population based and

238
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,720
it seems to me that was quite simple

239
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,810
that you look at you just have that some

240
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,480
proxy of what the demand looks like do

241
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:37,039
you do it like how many bars there are

242
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:43,889
what I mean

243
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:47,189
even similar really but Medical than

244
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:52,399
it's like you know how many stores you

245
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:58,140
have becomes a whole other thing so I

246
00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:01,620
you know we had a bunch of the 502 bow

247
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:04,110
texts that he came out there were four

248
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,940
hundred seventy something medical

249
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,509
establishments paying taxes to the

250
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:13,790
department how they study got out and

251
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:13,789
said 333 I don't know

252
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,620
[Laughter]

253
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,520
okay this look like our last question

254
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:09,009
primarily atole

255
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,939
and with respect to the notion of access

256
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:13,600
to the product

257
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:19,030
I've been forecasting and estimating the

258
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,190
size and cervixes started and I kinda

259
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:24,370
had the urge of midway through last year

260
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:27,370
that was independent of the SSP would be

261
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,740
a physical invasion and it struck me

262
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,960
that it appeared as though of a

263
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,149
significant number of consumers that

264
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,769
have been using the regulated system

265
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:40,659
were beginning to stop using or whatever

266
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:46,289
but when you look at the trends actually

267
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:47,980
across time and standardize it against

268
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:50,139
population characteristics of

269
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,278
low-larious it's very clear that

270
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:56,830
something happened about midway through

271
00:15:53,278 --> 00:16:00,639
not last year year before that just hurt

272
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,980
and badly right now I think this market

273
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,159
is underperforming by about 20% under

274
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,050
the new basis transactional basis

275
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:10,769
largely driven by the lack of retail

276
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:14,169
access even though there's 500 business

277
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:16,750
licenses allocated there were fewer than

278
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:19,870
400 stores that sold more than a

279
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,750
thousand dollars hospital every year and

280
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,389
it just blows my mind and fewer than a

281
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,549
half of those have a medical

282
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:29,769
certification and are they thought so

283
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:32,229
from the government's perspective the

284
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:34,480
governor's respect if revenue is

285
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,190
important to this state particularly as

286
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,589
our reduction strategy if you're

287
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,220
shipping a recreation where are we used

288
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:46,570
to through this product why is it

289
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:49,209
acceptable that an agency of the

290
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:51,850
government can use crap science which is

291
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:55,989
demonstrably just ridiculous also

292
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:58,329
controller to slap on something that

293
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,070
basically is this is something that our

294
00:16:58,328 --> 00:17:02,169
stores we used to regulate so that's how

295
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:07,449
many kind of Islamic they were staffed

296
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:10,269
without to release the revenue and at

297
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,910
the same time while forcing medical

298
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:14,740
issues and medical providers to either

299
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,920
go into the regulated system or

300
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:21,099
decriminalized themselves and then the

301
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,529
basically shop spigot to regulation and

302
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:28,088
computer legislation of businesses so

303
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:31,119
that fewer than 5% of the producers have

304
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:33,009
produced better products less than 1% of

305
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:39,129
the product sold was meant for the last

306
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:41,500
year that's a sales tax and and fewer

307
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,510
than maybe 1/5 of the access points we

308
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,130
have the degree in cross area are earned

309
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:48,700
they will serve patients as patients

310
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:52,240
that is the purposes in my opinion we

311
00:17:48,700 --> 00:18:05,860
make our money serve these do you think

312
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:10,808
the governor might be interested I think

313
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:13,298
I think Jay is interested in marketplace

314
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:17,079
whether he's down at this fundamental

315
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:19,418
level or the micro level of this John's

316
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:23,079
right I don't know because as I've said

317
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:26,440
before actually not here but the entire

318
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:31,990
amount of revenue to the state is dust

319
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:35,140
and wind this industry is very small so

320
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,130
do they care that they care only as much

321
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,330
as the money

322
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:49,059
right aerospace really care tech they

323
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:51,480
care know this the reality is that when

324
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:54,639
they started for these single licenses I

325
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,650
joking was did little convo she said

326
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,880
well in 11 years they'll actually get to

327
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:04,030
the 233 licenses well they still aren't

328
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:09,659
there but now we have we get to 530

329
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:11,950
whatever any yeah it's a really weird

330
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:15,280
you know I don't understand what they're

331
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:18,580
doing with that but I will say that it

332
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,879
was when Portland well 14 you know made

333
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:23,619
it legal to grow that home I got on the

334
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,740
phone with some producers I don't have

335
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:28,869
anybody I I just call it ran sort of the

336
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,069
guys that were in Vancouver and I said

337
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:33,189
hey what's going on

338
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:36,928
and a couple my wives lost 50 percent of

339
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,250
my business back like week and so

340
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:41,500
recently I was down in Portland one of

341
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:44,470
the guys out to look and Matthews and I

342
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,509
just spent an 8 for 17 bucks and it's

343
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,720
some of the best I've ever had

344
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:51,759
and I said okay cool he goes that would

345
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,600
have been 56 bucks in Seattle where is

346
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:58,379
John so what the nobody's bringing it

347
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,379
back and forth

348
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:14,189
I think I mean my own personal big take

349
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,990
away whatever my affiliation I think

350
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,730
what happened to the medical industry is

351
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,730
totally unethical and immoral
