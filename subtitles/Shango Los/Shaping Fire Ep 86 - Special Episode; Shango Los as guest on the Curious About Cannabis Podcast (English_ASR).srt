2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,638
i'm not really a big fan of holidays

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960
ever since i was a kid everyone around

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,198
me had these huge expectations on what

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,600
they wanted their holiday to look like

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,160
it created an ungodly amount of pressure

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
to perform for the delight of others and

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
to soothe them when their childish

9
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,159
desires were not met

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
it is exhausting and i've only realized

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,079
how much it has impacted my life in the

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,679
last couple of years during quarantine

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,759
because of all the time i've had for

14
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,039
self-reflection and a bit of tick-tock

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,960
therapy too

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,920
i shared this with you as a cautionary

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,079
tale about keeping your expectations low

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,920
because on this episode on shaping fire

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,239

curious about cannabis podcast the

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,359
show's host jason wilson is absolutely

24
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,198
delightful and we share a similar vibe

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
the interview covers my thoughts on

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,039
using outdoor regenerative cultivation

27
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,280
techniques indoors the rocky transition

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
from medical to recreational markets for

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,079
cannabis patients at the state level how

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,720
to form local growers collectives and

31
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,959
how i form the one here on vashon island

32
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,560
the rise of autoflowers of course and

33
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,879

shaping fire the podcast among other

35
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,679

00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,679
there

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
and jokes about the holidays and low

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,118
expectations aside i'm sharing this

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,040
interview because i'm actually proud of

40
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,640
what jase and i produced i certainly

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,400
don't share all the podcasts where i

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
appear but this one is especially well

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,560
done and i think you might enjoy it

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799

recording my side of the video outside

52
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,280
on my deck and it was pretty chilly that

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,960
morning and i got the sniffles

54

00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,839

now of shaping fire it's gotten to the

103
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,399
point where uh it can support me now so

104
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,359
so that is nice it was a lot of a lot of

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,799
years of doing multiple jobs um but but

106
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
i'm at the point now that i can i can

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,920
really focus on the show and you know um

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,519
i'm very grateful for the opportunity

109
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,598
that's yeah that's so awesome and

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
hopeful for me to hear because i'm only

111
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,759
you know we're just past like a year and

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,599
a half or so of curious about cannabis

113
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,239
um running and so i'm in that period

114
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,719
right now working like multiple jobs

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,560
balancing this too and trying to to make

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,199
it all happen so i can totally

117
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,360
totally relate to that that hustle

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
um and i know that a lot of my listeners

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,800
because they've told me a lot of my

120
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,199
listeners do already listen to shaping

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,960
fire but to those that are unfamiliar

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,160
don't know who you are do you mind uh

123
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,279
providing just a little bit of

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
background

125
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,439
into um

126
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,879
you know first what shaping fire is and

127
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,639
then i want to work backwards and just

128
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,439
talk about kind of your relationship

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,360
with cannabis and and uh your general

130
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,399
story

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
all right well then i guess i'll just

132
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,359
start with talking a little bit about

133
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
shaping fire and then you can lead me

134
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
wherever you want to leave perfect after

135
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,720
that

136
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,000
so um

137
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,360
shaping fire is a audio only podcast

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,720
that focuses on uh cannabis health

139
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
cultivation

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,039
and uh solventless extraction techniques

141
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,119
and so

142
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,120
it is in the early days but for the

143
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,038
first year

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
i was focused to a great deal on

145
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,918
cannabis business but over time um not

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,759
only were there a lot of other people

147
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,519
covering cannabis business but i i

148
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,759
realized that after

149
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,639
medical cannabis went away in my state

150
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,038
of washington and my national clients in

151
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,199
medical started converting to rec that

152
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,360
um the vibe changed in the scene

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,038
and i wasn't as excited about covering

154
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
business anymore i was really much more

155
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,478
interested in

156
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,839
cannabis patients

157
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,918
different uh cultivars um um how working

158
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,159
with them in different preparations

159
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,359
helps uh human health

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,960
and then

161
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,879
um after

162
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,120
uh you know after i learned how to make

163
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,159
um uh ice hash

164
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,038
and then once ice rosin came on the

165
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,080
scene

166
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,240
i realized that that most of us can do

167
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,079
all the things that we need for cannabis

168
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,160
at home without even

169
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,000
interfacing with the licensed market and

170
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,680
while and while i wish the licensed

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
market success and i've got lots of

172
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,160
friends in the licensed market

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
um uh i found that that wasn't the part

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
that i was most excited about the part i

175
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,478
was excited about

176
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,519
was um small cannabis communities home

177
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,318
grow

178
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,478
and and you know people trading cannabis

179
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,240
so that so they had greater variety so

180
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,959
so that's essentially what uh shaping

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,759
fire covers now um we have got uh you

182
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,519
know some of the best um guests in the

183
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
whole world available to us

184
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,758
we're pulling in

185
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,199
you know

186
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,479
botany botanists um scientists from the

187
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,439
lab folks who are you know neurologists

188
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,318
um

189
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,478
also cannabis breeders uh you know a

190
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,039
master uh master hashmaker sounds like

191
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,719
that right yeah but but folks are very

192
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,680
talented and experienced with making

193
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
hash and and so um i bring him on the

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
show and

195
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,120
and we talk a lot of specifics the idea

196
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,080
of the show was always

197
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,319
to give people enough um uh information

198
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,240
to be able to take action it frustrates

199
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
me when i listen to a podcast that is

200
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,160
supposed to be teaching me but it leaves

201
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,918
all these big gaps and so i really do my

202
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
best to

203
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,879
provide content that gives people a nice

204
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,478
full package so that they can either

205
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:25,519
make decisions or or do the technique or

206
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,639
or understand their health better in in

207
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,439
one nice tight 90 minute package

208
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
and so uh so so that's that's the nature

209
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,199
of the show and um

210
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,519
you know i like to say that uh shaping

211
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,919
fire with shaping for your get educated

212
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,839
while we respect your time right um i

213
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,758
don't spend a lot of time like you know

214
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,000
i don't get high on the show i don't i

215
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,439
don't talk about my guests with talk to

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,439
my guests about what cultivars they're

217
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,360
smoking like there's different shows

218
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,199
that do that and that's cool and

219
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,639
and it draws a kind of audience that

220
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,919
wants that kind of

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,160
um

222
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,240
um i don't know bro vibe right yeah like

223
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,840
hanging out yeah

224
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,079
yeah totally and they'll do these long

225
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,000
shows but but the kinds of folks who

226
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,959
tend to listen to shaping fire tend to

227
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,399
be you know cannabis uh enthusiasts who

228
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,638
also have got other things they've got

229
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,918
to get done maybe they run companies

230
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,439
maybe they are you know made their

231
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,680
decision makers uh or they're just like

232
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,598
people who are busy yeah and so i try

233
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,519
not to waste folks time i try to get in

234
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,639
get the point get people the information

235
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,719
that they're going to need on whatever

236
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,400
the topic and then and then end the show

237
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,680
and you know in a cheerful way

238
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,439
absolutely well and that's that's

239
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,799
something i really respect because

240
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,719
that's been

241
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,000
um a big part of my approach too and

242
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,760
part of that comes from just like my

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,158
analytical thinking as a scientist but

244
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,319
i'm like yeah i don't get high on the

245
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,759
show just it's really just what's the

246
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
the core piece of information that's

247
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,519
interesting and and making that

248
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
digestible and i noticed that in your

249
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,399
marketing you know that uh we're trying

250
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,479
not to waste your time um and i i love

251
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,440
that um and i also appreciate what you

252
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,560
just said about watching the

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,720
this transition and the vibe change from

254
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,239
as things switch from medical to wreck

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,680
because i definitely

256
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,278
experienced the same thing here in

257
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,399
oregon you know i was involved in the

258
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,039
medical program

259
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,679
i was a medical patient and also working

260
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,000
um you know building this lab to try to

261
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,599
help people understand what was in their

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
products and we were dealing mostly with

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,759
patients a lot of medical patients that

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,839
were make growing their own cannabis

265
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,120
making their own products and wanting to

266
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
understand whether they were safe to

267
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,959
consume and what the potency was and

268
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,518
that sort of thing and then you do see

269
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,879
this shift and now

270
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,440
all of it is just so so different

271
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,320
and it's hard i think for some people to

272
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,160
appreciate just how substantially

273
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,800
things have changed if they weren't

274
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,079
involved in the medical systems before

275
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,000
you know everything started to come

276
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,920
online especially in other states that

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
you know are taking a little longer to

278
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,479
to make some of these changes to their

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
laws

280
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,360
um so can you speak to that a little bit

281
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,879
uh just to expand a little bit more on

282
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,039
your perspective

283
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:06,480
on just exactly how things changed from

284
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,559
uh kind of the early medical days into

285
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
um you know the legal systems that we

286
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,359
have now what were some of those changes

287
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,519
you started to pick up on

288
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,919
sure um i've got three that i think are

289
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,278
probably good to hit on the first one is

290
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,078
we've already hit on a little bit which

291
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,559
is

292
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,639
the the players changed who was involved

293
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,639
uh during the medical days um you know

294
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,679
there were there were more heritage

295
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:33,439
cultivators and heritage medicine errors

296
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:35,599
who were involved um who were not uh

297
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
they were fringe folks because there was

298
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,879
a lot to lose back in the metal medical

299
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
days too when they were still still

300
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,120
being raids and and things and the laws

301
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
were changing and so many people were

302
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,399
working in the gray market

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,240
that um you know most of us had some of

304
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,200
the people in law enforcement who were

305
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,799
supporting our our you know ability to

306
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
create medicine and put it in the hands

307
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,719
of cannabis patients but there were

308
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,360
other folks in law enforcement who were

309
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,639
not ascribing to that and so uh it made

310
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,399
it very risky and and you know

311
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,199
once it became

312
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,720
more safe for capital

313
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,360
um

314
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,000
and licensing started to happen

315
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,759
the the capital came and with that comes

316
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,278
a different kind of risk assessment and

317
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,000
different um

318
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,879
different uh bureaucracy for the the

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,078
players and a lot of the the heritage

320
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,439
cultivators they didn't have the the the

321
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,559
credit score

322
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,200
to to rent a loan a legal location or

323
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,239
they didn't have the business acumen

324
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
because

325
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,560
at their heart they were farmers right

326
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,639
or alchemists how they saw themselves

327
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,559
not really as business people

328
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,439
and the people who were organized and

329
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,199
did have capital to be able to to rent

330
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
legal places and go through the state

331
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,839
bureaucracy and end up getting the

332
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,679
licenses and know how to hire out for hr

333
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,240
and know how to sell to investors those

334
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,919
are a different kind of person and and

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839
again i don't intend and it's not my

336
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,639
goal here to diss those folks because i

337
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,600
think that uh increased access in every

338
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,839
state is important and access is is a

339
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,120
priority

340
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,760
um it very much changed from a

341
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,159
we're in it for the patients and i've

342
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,559
been around cannabis all you know for

343
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,278
years and we're trying to do our best by

344
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,479
the patients into being something that

345
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:25,600
has

346
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,560
more

347
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,278
neon lights and and finer packaging you

348
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,679
know yeah and now the vibe changed and

349
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:36,078
and and for you know and so so that was

350
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,879
a significant difference um the second

351
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:42,559
thing i'll point out is that the

352
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,000
the the varieties of products change now

353
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,199
certainly

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,240
now that we're many more years in um to

355
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,879
legalization in or at least licensing in

356
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,278
some states there are beginning to be

357
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,639
more

358
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:57,360
patient-focused products

359
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
but

360
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,800
just about every state that has medical

361
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,519
first and then they go wreck there is

362
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,000
this sudden dearth of medical products

363
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
when the licenses uh come out

364
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,559
because licensed folks know that the

365
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,120
things that are always a reliable sell

366
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,518
are high thc flour and so that's what

367
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,679
everybody starts with you know and i had

368
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,480
plenty of clients who are making this

369
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,039
transition they're like all right

370
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,639
start with the high thc flower once we

371
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,039
get that established then we're going to

372
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
roll out the other products well for

373
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,199
patients who had gotten off their their

374
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,560
pharmaceuticals

375
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,240
that gap could literally kill them um

376
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,679
either because they had to go back to

377
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,959
pharmaceuticals and they were dealing

378
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:45,599
with those side effects or um they had

379
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,359
gotten to a point where the body had

380
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,480
healed enough in certain ways that they

381
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,120
couldn't go back to those same

382
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,600
pharmaceuticals without it being a bumpy

383
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,839
ride of getting your body back attuned

384
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,519
to a pharmaceutical solution instead of

385
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,680
an herbal solution

386
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,000
and so um

387
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:06,078
so uh you know a perfect example for

388
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,320
that is um full extract um cannabis oil

389
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:13,039
so an ethanol extract most of us know it

390
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,320
is rso so rso usually disappears from

391
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,879
the market

392
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,440
during the transition from medical

393
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,120
to recreational and then when it does

394
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
start to show up in a wreck market

395
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,159
you'll find companies who are like

396
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,360
selling their co2 rso right which is not

397
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,198
you know you know

398
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,440
it's not the same thing right

399
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,679
because it's more economical for them to

400
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,399
run it you know through a co2 machine

401
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,599
than it is for them to do the more often

402
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,759
laborious

403
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,639
um ethanol extraction

404
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,759
and um and so the

405
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,959
there's this there's this little variety

406
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,519
of

407
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,278
uh products are gone however with the

408
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,679
legal market some really cool things

409
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,120
have come about like um really uh great

410
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,519
dispensers

411
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,078
um for for rso

412
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,799
and some of the inhalers are pretty

413
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,958
incredible um certainly the uh the

414
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,759
advancement of vaporizers has just

415
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,518
wildly expanded so there's been a lot of

416
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,600
things that they could that have come

417
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,639
with the licensed market too but i think

418
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,680
that's more to do with the the idea that

419
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,600
um

420
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,000
it's easier for these cannabis companies

421
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,278
to get funding now for their novel

422
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,759
products where um you know uh medical is

423
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,078
pre-capitalist capital right and so

424
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,480
there was it was a lot harder to for for

425
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,519
those companies and my third example

426
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,959
also involves rso the uh the full

427
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,440
extract oil you know back in the day

428
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,239
if you had if you needed rso because you

429
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,920
were sick um you could go to

430
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,079
at least on the west coast you could go

431
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,799
to some kind of uh you know patient

432
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,479
cannabis exchange of some sort right

433
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,198
and you know they they were often you

434
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,879
know straddling the gray market and you

435
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,758
know they they were they're often you

436
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,519
know kind of straddling legality but the

437
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,240
heart was there and the quality was

438
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,839
there often and um the people were

439
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,759
smiling and there were lots of hugs and

440
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,839
it felt like a family thing

441
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,639
and um and depending on where you were

442
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,199
regionally you could get um a one

443
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,639
milliliter syringe of high quality rso

444
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:19,039
for between 15 and 60 bucks 15 or 50

445
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,198
bucks depending on where you were

446
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,559
and and here and here is the example

447
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,159
part is that

448
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,479
you know just about everybody i knew who

449
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,919
made rso had a discount for people who

450
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,399
were doing a 60 milliliters and 90 days

451
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,838
cannabis protocol right yeah because if

452
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,759
you if you had cancer and you had found

453
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,160
yourself um you know gonna try rso

454
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,879
you're either already kind of like an

455
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:48,078
herbally minded person yeah or you were

456
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,278
already broke because the western system

457
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,039
had already taken all your money the

458
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,278
doctors are already taking them all and

459
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,759
so you were you were at your last bet

460
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,159
and you were gonna try cannabis right so

461
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,240
usually you know the people who had

462
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,799
cancer and were ready to try rso were

463
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,400
already broke and we all felt bad for

464
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,240
them because they had cancer right yeah

465
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,519
terrible terrible thing to have to deal

466
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,759
with and so you'd get people who

467
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,959
you know would give somebody a huge

468
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,720
reduction

469
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,439
say say if they were selling their

470
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,400
syringes for you know fifty dollars

471
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,000
normally

472
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,720
they would you know if you're gonna buy

473
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,279
60 we'll drop the price down to 25 bucks

474
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,959
right we'll do it half price and like

475
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,200
sure some of that is like you're buying

476
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,519
in volume right everybody you know

477
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,279
volume discounts are good but but really

478
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:34,960
it was more than that there was a lot of

479
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,359
heart in that price

480
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,960
and um

481
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:44,159
the the licensed market is not able to

482
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,240
do that kind of price reduction

483
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,240
and so uh you know there is not bulk

484
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,919
purchasing really in the license market

485
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,880
like you know if you if you need

486
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,280
multiple syringes of rso you buy one for

487
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,600
72 dollars and another for 72 dollars

488
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:02,240
and then another for 72.

489
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,759
and so people who need cannabis to live

490
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
it has become harder for them to

491
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,160
purchase at reasonable prices in the

492
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,480
wreck market which of course is keeping

493
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,038
the um the alternative unlicensed market

494
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,480
very much alive throughout the country

495
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,240
and um and you know the the the rocky

496
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,519
transition from the medical markets in

497
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,880
most states to the wreck um markets

498
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,440
um it has

499
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,120
it's kind of done bad for both it's it

500
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,798
was bad for the medical heritage

501
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,199
processors it's also bad for the

502
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,200
patients and also because

503
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,840
you know this black market is still

504
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,038
being kept alive because it's so needed

505
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:41,038
it's also bad for iraq so mostly

506
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,759
you know the state's mismanagement of

507
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:47,038
these transitions from medical to

508
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,519
licensed recreational has just uh given

509
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,440
us a a a worse

510
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,200
of all options

511
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,000
yeah everything that that you just

512
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,400
brought up it brings out a lot of

513
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,640
memories for me thinking about oregon

514
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,320
and the transitions that we saw you know

515
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,400
going from medical

516
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,639
to

517
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,798
to recreational and one thing that i

518
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
think about from a patient perspective

519
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,798
particularly when you talk about the

520
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,759
reduction in the diversity of products i

521
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,519
remember

522
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,839
how much experimentation was going on

523
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,160
with cbd thc ratios

524
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:23,119
leading up to like 2016 or so and

525
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,480
obviously it's still happening but um

526
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,319
in the medical system

527
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,360
you know uh

528
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,960
if i

529
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,719
went to somebody and said i was looking

530
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,400
for a certain ratio or

531
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,759
once dispensaries became legal because

532
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,480
for a while they were kind of in this

533
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,119
weird gray area um

534
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,599
yeah once they became officially legal

535
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,678
you know you could find four to ones

536
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,279
three to ones two to ones one to ones

537
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,559
like you could find all of these things

538
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,200
you know there wouldn't be a lot of them

539
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,798
but they they were solid and uh for me i

540
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,400
have these spinal cord injuries and i

541
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,839
found you know like a two to one to four

542
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,400
to one is uh very nice for that

543
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,918
i noticed that when things went uh

544
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,840
recreational you really don't see a lot

545
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,840
of that anymore um

546
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,759
you know you might see some one-to-ones

547
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:10,240
um but that's that's most of what you

548
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,599
see and it's either high thc

549
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,519
high cbd is now kind of getting

550
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,798
relegated to hemp but you still see that

551
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,839
in dispensaries um from time to time

552
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,519
um

553
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,359
but but that's it and so for someone

554
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:24,400
like myself that is a medical patient

555
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,599
that no longer has a card because it's

556
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,960
now legal

557
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,000
um

558
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,960
that uh that was a big change um

559
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,640
and so i i definitely um

560
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,200
have seen a lot of those those same

561
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,720
changes too and hearing you talk about

562
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,960
it you know it's obvious you have a lot

563
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,720
of passion for the patience and a lot of

564
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,159
passion for that you know like you're

565
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,319
saying the

566
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,440
um the kind of source where all of this

567
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:53,279
you know is is really coming from so

568
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,960
to kind of rewind quite a bit um

569
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,119
do you mind sharing

570
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,919
uh how did your relationship with

571
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:03,038
cannabis um get started is it something

572
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,960
that goes back into you know teenage or

573
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,038
early 20s for you or is it something

574
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,919
that you discovered later how did that

575
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:12,480
relationship come about

576
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,159
um i would say i had i had two

577
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,880
beginnings of my relationship with

578
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,760
cannabis because uh the first time was

579
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,640
um

580
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,879
my freshman year of college um

581
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,640
i went home he lived in new york he went

582
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,159
home for christmas and he came back and

583
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,520
he brought some joints

584
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,600
and i had never had access before um

585
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,960
and and you know had never you know seen

586
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,279
it around or anything it just wasn't

587
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,679
where i lived and yeah you know uh

588
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,519
suburbs catholic school that whole thing

589
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,960
and um and he brought it back and you

590
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,879
know i for whatever reason i was

591
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,240
immediately interested in like there was

592
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,919
no second thought he's like oh you want

593
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,159
to try this i'm like yeah let's try new

594
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,080
things you know yes and so we tried it

595
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,799
and i immediately thought it was great

596
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,678
from a an um an experiential

597
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,319
you know

598
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,440
both recreationally because it was fun

599
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,599
um but also i you know i immediately got

600
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,000
the idea of the mind expansion part yeah

601
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,639
i'm like oh wow i really it really

602
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,279
shifts my perspective in ways i can

603
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,759
consider my mundane life in new fresh

604
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,798
ways so i thought that was really cool

605
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,759
and you know it took me you know

606
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,918
about four weeks to get my first bag

607
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,240
after that and then i don't think i've

608
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,480
been without it ever since you know you

609
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,038

610
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,640

624
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,880
so then we've got like just like like a

625
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,480
lifetime of being somebody who enjoys

626
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,320
cannabis myself

627
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,079
but then um

628
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:08,720
2011 came and um i was in a car accident

629
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,879
i suffered a dual concussion resulting

630
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,159
in a traumatic brain injury

631
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,159
and um the neurologist actually told me

632
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,440
off the record he says you know um i

633
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,080
recommend

634
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,200
that you um you know

635
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,480
consider

636
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,159
uh

637
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,038
using mushrooms

638
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,400
to help rebuild your neural net and kind

639
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,558
of soothe the the the overactivity that

640
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,240
i was getting the over stimulation

641
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,000
and he says um

642
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,279
and he said you know i also recommend

643
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,038
that you move out of the city and so i

644
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,918
moved out to vashon island where i live

645
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,000
now

646
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,440
and and and he also said i understand

647
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
that there's some you know healing

648
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,000
properties in cannabis he says i can't

649
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
recommend any of this for you officially

650
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,919
he says but but if you're you know um

651
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
like look into this stuff and i was

652
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,799
astonished right because you know back

653
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,640

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,720
right right cannabis and i was i was i

656
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,918

657
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,839
and um and so i'm like huh edison huh

658
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,080
all right and so i started looking into

659
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,918
it and um started you know reading the

660
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,839
early research mostly coming out of

661
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,759
europe and everything i'm like wow there

662
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,639
really are medicinal properties going on

663
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:18,400
here

664
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,559
and um

665
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,320
and then and then my dad got really bad

666
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:26,879
knees and so um so so i had already

667
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,720
learned how to make a cannabis tincture

668
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,799
for myself

669
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
to help keep my

670
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,639
my nervous system calm and then i

671
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,360
wouldn't get over stimulated

672
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,278
um but then my dad knees got really bad

673
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,199
and and the the pharmaceuticals he was

674
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,278
using for anti-inflammation really had

675
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
some bad side effects

676
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,519
and so um

677
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,558
i i said hey i bet you i could put my

678
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,599
tincture

679
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,720
in some like like body lotion or hand

680
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,278
cream or something and whip them

681
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,278
together and boom topical right and so i

682
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,720
tried it and it worked and my dad put it

683
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,400
on his knees and he's all like oh my

684
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,000
gosh this works so much better and for

685
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,320
so much longer

686
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
than this like ugly pharmaceutical that

687
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,839
he was one and i don't mean to diss all

688
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,600
pharmaceuticals right sure there are

689
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,158
there are appropriate pharmaceuticals at

690
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,480
appropriate times but in this case an

691
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,799
herbal remedy was much better for my dad

692
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,960
and um he was very enthusiastic about it

693
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,798
and um and that made me feel good about

694
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
it as well because um you know my

695
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,200
parents were historically um

696
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,960
discouraging me from yeah

697
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,840
cannabis or you know like drugs in

698
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,440
general right sure yeah parents and uh

699
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,759
but but at this point i'm like wait a

700
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,080
minute something here this is helping me

701
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,759
soothe my brain injury and heal and now

702
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,240
it's helping my dad too

703
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,319
what else is going on and so i dove into

704
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,079
both um

705
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,399
like learning about

706
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,519
cannabis medicine from you know any

707
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,000
sources i could and also trying to learn

708
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,679
uh herbal preparations um i live here in

709
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,079
seattle i live pretty close to bastyr

710
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,519
university yeah and so my whole area is

711
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,599
just like dripping with herbalists

712
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,960
they're everywhere and so you know if

713
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,240
you're you know if

714
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,278
you're nice to them they will tell you

715
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,200
their secrets and so and so that's that

716
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,798
that's when i got my rebirth in the in

717
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,798
the cannabis medicine

718
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,240
in in 2011

719
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:13,839
and um

720
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,640
and then of course you know things

721
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:19,119
things have continued uh since then

722
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,720
yeah and and how did that i mean first

723
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,359
of all i want to say

724
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,798
um i get why people wanted us to talk

725
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,639
because

726
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,798
in some ways we have some

727
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,038
big parallels between the the two of us

728
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,038
because

729
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,960
i went through a similar experience with

730
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,879
my mom so after i had all these spinal

731
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,558
cord injuries and trying to figure out

732
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,400
how to get control over

733
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,759
you know myself and and the things that

734
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,798
i was dealing with

735
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,720
um

736
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,798
i had been a regular cannabis user just

737
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,640
like you had described and then you know

738
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,519
kind of discover this new perspective of

739
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,360
looking at it and then uh my mom had

740
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,558
really bad fibromyalgia and you know

741
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:59,199
arthritis and stuff and very similarly i

742
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:02,079
gave her some extract that we mixed with

743
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,440
a uh like a coconut oil based um topical

744
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,960
this yeah i can't remember what it was

745
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,600
just really simple just mixed it in

746
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,679
there and likewise she's like oh my gosh

747
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,199
this is better than any pharmaceutical

748
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,320
i've ever taken for

749
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,240
you know for these these problems

750
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,918
so it's funny

751
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,120
those parallels

752
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,200
i can

753
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,798
um totally relate to

754
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,679
and how did

755
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:28,000
so you you know you start to understand

756
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,600
how cannabis is affecting you and

757
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,839
helping you find this kind of new

758
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,079
balance that you need in your life

759
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,079
and then that's bleeding out into loved

760
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,000
ones and seeing the effects that

761
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,119
cannabis can have on them

762
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,480
um

763
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,918
when did your passion for

764
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,399
education

765
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,640
start to really manifest where you

766
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,678
really started to move forward in

767
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,960
sharing

768
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,720
all of these things that you were

769
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
learning with other people because

770
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,399
you've been doing i mean beyond the

771
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,879
podcast you've organized uh all sorts of

772
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,239
events um on vaishan island and other

773
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,559
things like that and i definitely want

774
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,839
to talk about

775
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,720
the work that you've done to really

776
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:09,119
bring the community together um to learn

777
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,038
and share knowledge and everything so

778
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,678
what were the yeah

779
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,158
how did those seeds i guess get

780
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,480
germinated if you will to bloom into a

781
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,720
lot of the education

782
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,480
i see where you're going yeah um so so

783
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,278
the way the way the timeline went out is

784
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,759
um

785
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,640
hit my head in 2011

786
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,558
started making my own preparations and

787
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,360
you know when you're making tincture

788
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,119
and and it's working for you and and

789
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,119
people your friends and loved ones find

790
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,879
out you're making it suddenly they're

791
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,038
using your tinctures

792
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,640
and then and then their loved ones are

793
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,398
using your tinctures

794
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,360
and and then medical

795
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,558
got going uh more significantly in

796
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,439
washington

797
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:55,359
um or at least my participation of it

798
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,200
was was increased and my tinctures um

799
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,240
became being sold through the the

800
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,278
washington medical market nice and it

801
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,120
was great um i was able to

802
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:09,200
make these tinctures and share them

803
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,479
through um you know legal dispensaries

804
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,399
and um

805
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,640
it was at that point that people started

806
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,639
asking me questions because at that

807
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,240
point they're all like okay which of the

808
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,320
four tinctures do i want why do i want

809
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,720
them you know what you know which which

810
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,038
ver which cultivar what preparation is

811
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,600
going to help me now versus something in

812
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,440
high cbd that is designed to strengthen

813
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,000
your endocannabinoid system and will

814
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,519
help me long term you know like like and

815
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,119
and that was when i first got into

816
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,119
thinking about and teaching dosing

817
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,439
strategies to patients

818
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,079
and so i loved that i really enjoyed

819
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,759
that and um and you know the the medical

820
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,678
days were a heyday right not not only

821
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,599
because everybody was so not not

822
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,080
everybody but the vast majority of

823
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,079
people were very nice um

824
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,519
but also the margins weren't as tight as

825
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,839
they are today

826
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,398
and so you know you could actually do

827
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,720
this and and and support yourself and

828
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,359
and while i never got to that level

829
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,038
right um uh we you know the market

830
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:12,000
transitioned yeah to legal before you

831
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,720
know i i had like a business business

832
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,839
right my volume was never of units where

833
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,759
that was never

834
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,319
significant but people liked it right

835
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,720
people and that that buoyed me and i

836
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,480
started teaching so then when there was

837
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,399
the um

838
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,000
when when the market started to um

839
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:33,439
well before we talk about the market

840
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,278
pivoting it was at the same time that i

841
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,679
um began

842
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,759
reaching out to the the underground

843
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,399
cannabis growers on vashon

844
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,158
because uh vashon has been known for its

845
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,319
high quality cannabis all the way back

846
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,399
to the 70s you know bands would come

847
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,480
through seattle and they'd try to like

848
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,918
get their vashon hookup and pick up some

849
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,558
weed for the rest of tour and all that

850
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,399
kind of stuff and so i knew that these

851
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,678
these cultivators were here on vacheron

852
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,278
but i also knew they were very much

853
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,038
still in the underground

854
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,679
and but but because there were so many

855
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,440
people producing on the island um

856
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,159
prices for ounces on the island were

857
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,840
just like ridiculously low you know and

858
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,399
um that was great if you lived on the

859
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,639
island but it was really bad for the the

860
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,038
cultivators who were trying to support

861
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,440
their families on it and

862
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,440
and i realized that um there were all

863
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,360
these dispensaries

864
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,919
a short ferry ride away in uh in seattle

865
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,678
that um would love to have the produce

866
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,120
from my island

867
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,640
but none of the none of the cultivators

868
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,398
wanted to leave the island i didn't want

869
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,399
to i still don't know right

870
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,839
you know once you moved here you're like

871
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,319
you're like ah i don't want to go to

872
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,240
babylon yeah right yeah

873
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,000
i don't want to go to that it's noisy

874
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,159
and everybody's driving crazy and

875
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,839
everything's good here we'll just stay

876
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,320
in place yeah

877
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,720
but um but because i was you know i was

878
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:55,278
more recently on the island than these

879
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,360
cultivators who grew up here um

880
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,798
i wrote a one-page invitation talking a

881
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,678
little bit about

882
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:06,720
um this group that i wanted to form on

883
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,200
vashon um called vimeo

884
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,079
which stands for the vashon the vashon

885
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,798
island marijuana entrepreneurs alliance

886
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,639
and i wanted to know what they

887
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,879
wanted as far as representation like

888
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,440
what what can you use as a cultivator

889
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,360
what would help you in the underground

890
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,399
and so i made up a bunch of these

891
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,719
letters

892
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,879
and i started giving them out

893
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,440
to the kinds of people on the island who

894
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,360
i thought would know cultivators so

895
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,000
particular types of farmers certain

896
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,359
types of community organizers i'm like

897
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,880
i mean like you don't have to tell me if

898
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,319
you know a cultivator but if you know a

899
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
cultivator would you give them this

900
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,200
letter and they're like huh that's

901
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,720
interesting

902
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,399
yeah and so

903
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,798
these these these letters went into the

904
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,558
underground i made like 25 of them

905
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:52,879
and these these um these black market

906
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,200
cultivators started like showing up at

907
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,600
the oddest of times too because nobody

908
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,720
was calling me i would just be you know

909
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,558
you know

910
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,839
at a baseball game or a softball game

911
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,678
you know and somebody would come up to

912
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:06,000
me and say like you know you're shango

913
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,360
right i'm like yeah i'm like hey i got

914
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,038
your letter

915
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,479
wow wow

916
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,359
and they're like you want to go for a

917
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,640
little walk i'm like yes and so we'd go

918
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:18,879
and we'd talk and and you know the the

919
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,880
universally everybody wanted secure

920
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,080
right everybody was afraid to get busted

921
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,278
for their grows

922
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,960
and so i knew that um normalization on

923
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,880
the island was one of the important

924
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,079
things that vimy was going to do

925
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,760
um

926
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,158
and then and then the other thing was is

927
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,398
that everybody um was spending way too

928
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,039
much money on inputs yeah all the

929
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,639
impulses fancy ass inputs are expensive

930
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,480
and so um

931
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,320
so the very first thing i did when i

932
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,880
formed vimeo was to um start essentially

933
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,720
a media i guess propaganda campaign that

934
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,080
was pro cultivator

935
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,319
and um uh you know thing things like um

936
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,000
um you know

937
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,240
we were you we back in those days we

938
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,319
were using words like pot and and

939
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
marijuana a lot more than we were now

940
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,158
right so so we would do thing you know

941
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,878
we would put out things like you know

942
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:13,119
hug your local pot grower you know you

943
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:17,199
know um uh uh uh pot growers are local

944
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:20,399
farmers too yes um you know uh uh pot

945
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,158
cultivation is a family farm things like

946
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,398
this right which which got the rest of

947
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,800
the island to realize that um you don't

948
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,279
have to look at cannabis as a scourge

949
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,440
these are members of the community and

950
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,599
and we should embrace them and then the

951
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,200
second thing i did is i started pulling

952
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,639
together more of these cultivators and i

953
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,719
said um

954
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,358
you know this is still in the old days

955
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,838
when people were uh throwing away their

956
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:46,239
soil after every run right yeah instead

957
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,320
of keeping it and aging the soil and you

958
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,918
know more of a no-till kind of regen

959
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,440
thing right back in these days people

960
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,239
were just dumping their soil and thought

961
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,639
they had to start with new soil

962
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,959
so so you know we started bulk but we

963
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,039
started bulk purchasing soil and just

964
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,720
having you know a higher quality soil

965
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,960
than was available generally on the

966
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,879
island and we were just having it come

967
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,159
and be dumped at one location and

968
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,599
everybody would come with their truck

969
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,239
and fill up their truck and then head on

970
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,559
home and you know we got these hugely

971
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,000
better prices well after that people

972
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,078
were all like all right chango what else

973
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
what else you got for us you know and so

974
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,079
we started doing you know some other um

975
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,599
you know soil amendments we started

976
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,039
buying bulk

977
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,960
and um

978
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,759
you know this was this was well ahead of

979
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,240
my awareness of the more serious

980
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,720
regenerative scene which i am you know a

981
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,799
big part of now but in these early days

982
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:39,598
i knew i liked organic farming because i

983
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,079
i grew a little bit of organic food um

984
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,359
but i certainly didn't have like the the

985
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,119
regenerative whole mindset um i i was

986
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:48,719
just very stoked that we were using

987
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,800
natural amendments and i knew how to

988
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,879
make compost tea right yeah like that's

989
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,880
good you know just the idea was like you

990
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,200
know like let's let's try to like get

991
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,880
people off the bottle yes

992
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,838
that was a thing that early

993
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,280
um

994
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,799
and so we started doing that and people

995
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,119
really liked that well

996
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,200
at this point the the the underground

997
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,680
growers started to trust me more and i'm

998
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:11,519
learning a whole lot about what it means

999
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:14,159
to be a cultivator because i had i was

1000
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,000
not a cultivator i was an enthusiast and

1001
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,440

1002
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,519

00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:55,920
tonight one way or another and they're

1022
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,079
like

1023
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,400
all right let's give this a try

1024
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,760
and um i took it over there and i came

1025
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,358
back with money

1026
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,040
and so when i

1027
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,598
and i got them

1028
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,599
about 150 of the price that they would

1029
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,240
normally get on the island nice that

1030
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,680
made me very popular yes

1031
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,919
you know and so they're like wait you're

1032
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,598
saving us money on the inputs and you're

1033
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,800
bringing us home more money and setting

1034
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,880
up these relationships and then

1035
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,560
eventually once they

1036
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,559
they got set up

1037
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,400
you know the the the cannabis was

1038
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,960
finding its way off the island which

1039
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,838
honestly was making the cerned parents

1040
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,480
people

1041
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,078
a little happier you know

1042
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,920
because i was a public figure since i

1043
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,480
wasn't a cultivator i could be out front

1044
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,280
more and so i was out front saying nice

1045
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,838
things about cannabis farmers explaining

1046
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,680
their needs and explaining that this

1047
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,679
organization i had started was helping

1048
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,719
filter a lot of this cannabis off the

1049
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:53,118
island which that so caused them to

1050
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,838
embrace my new organization a little bit

1051
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,599
more but the farmers were also thrilled

1052
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,838
and um because they were able to get

1053
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,400
more for their products so

1054
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,920
so so this all happens but then

1055
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,559
everything falls apart at the end of

1056
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,599
medical um so we we you know we got

1057
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:12,320
together um as vimeo as a group a few

1058
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,480
times to go through the regulations when

1059
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,720
it came out like the the how to apply

1060
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,400
for a license i went and i read it all

1061
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,598
and i marked it all up and then got

1062
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,440
together all these people who are

1063
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,119
interested in getting licenses and

1064
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,679
essentially talked

1065
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,160
the regulations to everybody

1066
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,838
and the more and then we met three times

1067
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,159
like this and the more we got into it we

1068
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:33,920
more we realized that this sucked yeah

1069
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,078
and that this was this may this was

1070
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,079
going to be really expensive

1071
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,000
and didn't really have the needs of the

1072
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,720
cultivator at heart

1073
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,838
and um you know a couple of people tried

1074
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,598
um almost no one

1075
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:48,960
succeeded and um because they again they

1076
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,119
were they were wanting to give their

1077
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,358
money to a different kind of license

1078
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,440
holder yeah than people who were

1079
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:57,119
participating in the medical kit and so

1080
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,800
i had to make a decision at that point

1081
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,440
because um

1082
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,599
you know i wasn't going to be involved

1083
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,519
with the medical market anymore

1084
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,200
and um i what didn't look like i was

1085
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,039
going to move into the licensed market

1086
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,960
so what are we going to do and it came

1087
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,119
back to my first love which was teaching

1088
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,199
patients teaching dosing strategies and

1089
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,358
creating a safe place for cultivators

1090
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,239
and so the the initial meetings that we

1091
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,598
had just to learn about regulations

1092
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,078
became

1093
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,559
uh patient outreach meetings and so they

1094
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,079
became like you know um you know uh

1095
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,320
you know one doctor would come to well

1096
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,920
actually we're very lucky to have dr

1097
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,838
ethan russo i was gonna say yes

1098
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,039
neurologist lives on the island he's my

1099
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,639
neighbor yeah and so and so dr russo

1100
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,679
like you know came and talked at one of

1101
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,759
these events and explained the

1102
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,598
endocannabinoid system and everybody's

1103
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,680
all like you know this was very new

1104
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,720
information for for the people yeah

1105
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,919
right

1106
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:54,078
but also if if you are a an event

1107
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,358
promoter and you're trying to book

1108
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,599
speakers

1109
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:01,039
if a cannabis um

1110
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,680

1112
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,759
ethan russo right like

1113
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,838
they're figuring that you're pretty okay

1114
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,640
and i got all these yeses from

1115
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,880
international like cannabis talent who

1116
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,118
would come and i tell them that we're a

1117
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,880
patient outreach organization we don't

1118
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,440
charge any money to attend we're

1119
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,358
donation based only we do not pay our

1120
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,440
speakers but

1121
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:28,400
you know we'll um

1122
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,400
we had a sponsorship deal with the one

1123
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,920
uh hotel on the island i said you know

1124
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,440
if you come to the island overnight i'll

1125
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,039
put you up for the night

1126
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,480
but really you're just coming because

1127
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,719
you care about patients and you want to

1128
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,760
talk to the real deal people

1129
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,358
and people flocked to vashon and so

1130
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,079
suddenly now we've got this scene which

1131
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:48,559
grew from vashon to seattle to the

1132
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,720
pacific northwest you know we we've had

1133
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,639
people flying from colorado and from the

1134
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,559
bay area for different different events

1135
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,598
we've had because the the variety of

1136
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,639
teaching at these events was very down

1137
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,960
home

1138
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,719
good vibe stuff

1139
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,240
and um so that's where that's where the

1140
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:06,318
education of the circle always around

1141
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,679
your question that's where the education

1142
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:12,159
came in is it was it was originally

1143
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,000
let's organize cultivators because i'm

1144
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,399
interested in them and i wanted to be

1145
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,760
helpful on on this new island that i

1146
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,440
called home

1147
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,599
and then and then i saw things that i

1148
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,599
could do to be of service to them and so

1149
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,359
i did those things which helped my

1150
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,640
reputation as being somebody who was

1151
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,400
trustworthy

1152
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,960
and then and then we pivoted that into a

1153
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,440
patient organization to the point that

1154
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,039
you know i speak here at the senior

1155
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,639
center a couple times a year and i'm on

1156
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,960
the local radio station as a guest

1157
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:42,719
regularly and been on the front page of

1158
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,159
the newspaper you know it's like um

1159
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,719
there's i've got i've developed this

1160
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,399
niche for myself where um

1161
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,879
like i have been referred to as like the

1162

1163
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,680
times but not because i was selling bags

1164
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,240
right right i don't sell flour

1165
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,000
i'm i'm it's because i'm teaching

1166
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,679
everybody and then telling people where

1167
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,239
they can get the stuff that they need to

1168
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:07,440
feel better whether it's in the wreck or

1169
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,879
unlicensed market i just you know um so

1170
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,358
so that brings us you know pretty much

1171
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,200
to where we are now with vimeo where you

1172
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,119
know um unfortunately we've been on

1173
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:18,159
sabbatical because of covid right yeah

1174
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,680
um and vimeo will be the last group to

1175
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:21,358
get people coming back together because

1176
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,199
we're all patients right

1177
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,559
and so like we are at the most high risk

1178
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,519
and also you know

1179
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,639
there are a lot of people in the

1180
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,800
cannabis scene who um who are resisting

1181
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,440
vaccination yeah and so

1182
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,599
um i can't i'm certainly not going to be

1183
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,200
that guy who checks everybody's id at

1184
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,400
the door that's that's not really how i

1185
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,598
roll yep

1186
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,400
so we're just going to have to wait

1187
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,400
we're going to have to wait until um the

1188
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,079
risk has decreased it enough that we can

1189
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,160
bring together a room of a hundred

1190
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,640
patients and not have it be super

1191
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,199
dangerous so you know we won't have

1192
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,598
meetings until you know at least spring

1193
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,318
of 22 which is a bummer right yeah for

1194
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,760
sure

1195
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:00,480
good two years that's gonna leave us

1196
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,560
with a good two years without meetings

1197
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,119
um but you know gotta keep the patients

1198
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,199
safe exactly i mean it's it's the weird

1199
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,039
situation we're in i mean i i felt the

1200
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,519
same thing i used to

1201
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,759
do in-person workshops pretty regularly

1202
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,599
on cannabis science topics

1203
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,040
uh was doing guest lectures at

1204
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,440
universities and everything and it's

1205
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,519
been i mean pretty much once everything

1206
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,280
kicked off around you know february

1207
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,599
march of 2020

1208
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,400
you know it's like i have a daughter i

1209
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,400
also regularly see you know my parents

1210
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,358
who have all sorts of medical conditions

1211
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
you know

1212
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,519
myself and my wife have medical

1213
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:38,879
conditions so it's we've been basically

1214
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,400
you know just being very strict on um

1215
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,920
in-person events and having to get

1216
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,000
people together and it's

1217
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,280
um it's been interesting because i've

1218
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,599
had to rely on virtual communication

1219
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,400
um leaning more on podcasting leading

1220
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,720
more on on that sort of thing

1221
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,200
but it does feel weird because you like

1222
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,199
to be with people and there's there are

1223
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,118
these interactions and moments and

1224
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:03,118
knowledge sharing that happens in person

1225
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,000
that's so hard to

1226
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,079
um

1227
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,440
to get those dynamics captured in a

1228
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,760
virtual setting i'm sure you've

1229
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,358
experienced this where you see the

1230
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,760
knowledge sharing the questions being

1231
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:16,078
asked the looks on people's faces these

1232
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,240
different subtleties that come out in

1233
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,640
in-person events um

1234
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,919
that's really really special um

1235
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:23,039
at least you know those are the kinds of

1236
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,119
things that

1237
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,679
lead me to want to do those things more

1238
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,079
and more and seeing all that happen so i

1239
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,440
yeah i can imagine it's been hugs yeah

1240
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,960
yeah hugs

1241
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,639
hey like like

1242
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,240
you know it's like it's that simple like

1243
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,400
you know i live on an island i'm a

1244
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,879
single guy i live in a house by myself

1245
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,519
on the water right but i am not getting

1246
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,760
enough hugs yeah and you know

1247
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,759
at first when kovid came and all the

1248
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,480
conventions were canceled

1249
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,480
i must admit it was nice to get like six

1250
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,838
months to a year of a travel break right

1251
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,240
because i had been traveling two three

1252
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,920
weekends a month to to speak at events

1253
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,358
and to teach and whatever

1254
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,200
and um

1255
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,199
that had gotten to be a lot i was i was

1256
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,598
getting tired of being you know being a

1257
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,480
road warrior all the time yeah um

1258
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,720
but

1259
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,280
i really really like my

1260
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,439
my my national and now international

1261
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,040
group of cannabis family like the people

1262
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,720
i would see at events

1263
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,559
and so it was cool to have a break for a

1264
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,159
while but now the break has gone longer

1265
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,039
than i've needed

1266
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,879
um i am um you know i uh because i'm a

1267
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,119
i'm a high risk patient because i've got

1268
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,160

that this year right um

1273
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,119

kind of switch a little bit here you

1298
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,199
know we've been talking about

1299
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,160
um

1300
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,159
how

1301
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,440
all of this is developed and the work

1302
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:38,799
that you've been doing but i do want to

1303
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,720
spend some time

1304
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,079
just talking about you know the

1305
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:43,759
the show the curious about canvas

1306
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,920
podcast i want to talk about what makes

1307
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,800
you curious about cannabis

1308
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,039
um

1309
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,359
and so uh you know

1310
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,599
i'll just lay out one basic question

1311
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,960
related to the podcast and then spend on

1312
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,519
other things but

1313
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,400
um what are some

1314
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:03,280
insights that stand out to you

1315
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,358
that you've gained from all of the

1316
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,200
people that you've talked to you know

1317
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:10,318
over the past four years or so on the

1318
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:13,439
podcast what are some notable things

1319
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,559
that stood out to you that um

1320
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,480
uh maybe

1321
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,719
changed your perspective a little bit or

1322
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,719
that you just were totally unaware of

1323
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,799
that that kind of blew your mind but

1324
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,199
what are some uh kind of the more

1325
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,559
significant insights that you've gained

1326
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,558
from doing shaping fire

1327
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:34,239
well i would

1328
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,239
one thing for sure would be

1329
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,879
understanding how

1330
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,759
different each human's body is this idea

1331
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,599
of individualized medicine yeah um i

1332
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,440
really kind of thought that cannabis was

1333
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,119
the same for everybody and that's like

1334
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,838
wildly untrue

1335
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:53,440
um how how people react to different

1336
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:56,078
terpene profiles how people um you know

1337
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,720
cannabis is is biphasic right meaning

1338
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,800
you can take a little bit of thc

1339
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,959
which will reduce your anxiety but if

1340
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,599
you take beyond your personal threshold

1341
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,720
it will cause anxiety right and because

1342
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,640
of cannabis byphasic nature um we're all

1343
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,439
we all have different thresholds

1344
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,519
and so um you know somebody big get the

1345
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,440
relief they need with the tiniest little

1346
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,440
puffy puff whereas somebody else is

1347
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,679
going to be like pulling tubes and

1348
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,519
blowing clouds to get where they need

1349
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,838
based on what you know how many

1350
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:29,440
receptors they have and and

1351
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:31,759
how busy those receptors are and so

1352
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,760
the understanding that each patient

1353
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,000
needs to be addressed

1354
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,599
uniquely and without carrying over too

1355
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,800
many assumptions

1356
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,200
that was good for me to learn as a as a

1357
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,920
health educator but it was also good for

1358
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,399
me

1359
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,358
for just generally realizing that i

1360
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,680
should

1361
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:50,880
not generalize people

1362
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,118
entirely

1363
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,240
um to respect each person's individual

1364
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,720
nature

1365
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:59,598
um and i kind of got to that through

1366
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,759
trying to help people relieve their

1367
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,760
you know their but their body issues and

1368
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,119
just realizing that oh

1369
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,480
you know um

1370
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,559
everybody's different and on a lot of

1371
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,719
issues not just their medicine and not

1372
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,040
to assume i know folks so that was that

1373
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:15,679
was a breakthrough thing for me um

1374
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:18,559
another one was i had no idea i was so

1375
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,759
interested in soil science ah yeah um

1376
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,078
[Music]

1377
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,400
when when i first started cultivating it

1378
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,800
was just like take the bag soil put it

1379
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,720
in you know throw in some kind of

1380
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,160
nutrients from the store and grow a

1381
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:34,318
plant that's great um but then i started

1382
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,279
you know talking to

1383
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:36,800
um

1384
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,559
what would become known as the

1385
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,800
regenerative scene people and realizing

1386
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,200
the back of all the biological life in

1387
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,920
the rhizosphere and the protozoa and the

1388
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:50,159
microbes and how these folks get along

1389
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,960
and how for me one of the first things i

1390
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:57,118
realized was that um you know we get

1391
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,880
cold early in the season right so so

1392
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,640
we've already had it's it's it's like

1393
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,240
the second week of october coming into

1394
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,719
the second week of october now i've

1395
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,919
already had 50 degree nights for four

1396
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,078
weeks

1397
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,318
and and i did until i started learning

1398
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,400
about soil that i realized that the soil

1399
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,239
and the containers were going to sleep

1400
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,240
the microbes and everything were cysting

1401
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,879
up and then the plants would just go to

1402
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,399
mold so it wasn't that oh my my plants

1403
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,119
were unhealthy

1404
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,599
and then i got mold it's that the soil

1405
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,160
went to sleep which signaled to the

1406
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:31,119
plant that that were done for the season

1407
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:32,239
and so you should mold for the cycle of

1408
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,039
life

1409
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,039
well that was fascinating to me and so

1410
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,519
next thing you know i'm i'm reading

1411
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,920
everything i can on

1412
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,000
soil science and regenerative

1413
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,599
you know growing techniques and and and

1414
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,760
um

1415
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,039
creating your own inputs on your own

1416
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,040
property

1417
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:54,880
and uh you know when it comes to shaping

1418
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:56,719
fire the guests that i have um very much

1419
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,160
are based on what i'm interested in

1420
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,879
learning next

1421
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:03,199
um you know yeah and uh and luckily the

1422
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,880
show the show's at a point now where um

1423
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,838
you know everybody everybody takes my

1424
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,000
call right so it's cool i can i can i

1425
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:11,358
can reach out to whoever and say hey

1426
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,639
would you come on the show and talk

1427
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:14,400
about this thing that i would like to

1428
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,799
learn about and you know everybody's

1429
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,920
like yeah that would be great and um and

1430
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,920
i think that

1431
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,880
i think that because i don't fake that i

1432
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,119
know all this stuff before the show um i

1433
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,960
think the audience digs that because

1434
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,200
people it's very common for people to

1435
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,440
say um i like that we're learning so

1436
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,519
much together yeah and cause like you

1437
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,440
know you know some some podcasts they

1438
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:37,119
pretend that they know everything and

1439
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,720
they you know they'll even talk over the

1440
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,720
guests and try to tell

1441
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,078
like tell the guest story it's like i'm

1442
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,879
much more of a like

1443
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,920
get my mom ke i keep quiet and try to

1444
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,720
let the guest to tell their truth and

1445
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,079
then ask good questions um

1446
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:53,439
and then when i learned something like

1447
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,240
you know it's common for me to go like

1448
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,119
oh

1449
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,959
i never got that before and yeah

1450
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,920
and then you can almost feel my audience

1451
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,358
going oh me too yes

1452
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,760
and so um

1453
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,358
you know um i'm not i'm not gonna front

1454
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,839
for a second that i know all of this

1455
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:12,078
stuff you know after doing you know four

1456
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,519
years of my own show and then another

1457
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,240
105 episodes before that for

1458
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:18,239
entrepreneur.com

1459
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:19,439
you know i've done over you know 200

1460
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,159
episodes and i've been doing this for

1461
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,440
like five years or so i know a lot now

1462
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:27,598
um but i learn new stuff on every

1463
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,358
episode because that's why i do those

1464
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,680
topics so i can learn

1465
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:33,440
that's that's perfect i mean and having

1466
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:37,199
that

1467
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,639
lifelong learner mentality um i think is

1468
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,159
great i mean that's something i'm always

1469
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,960
trying to

1470
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,719
promote um that regardless of whatever

1471
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,639
niche you've specialized in that you

1472
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,000
know a lot about there's always so much

1473
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:49,440
more to learn

1474
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,119
um

1475
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,318
and uh to maintain that curiosity

1476
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,559
um is great it's humble too exactly yeah

1477
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,400
humble too yeah so as soon as you start

1478
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,480
you think you know everything

1479
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,000
you know not not only will you stop

1480
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,199
learning but you'll probably also start

1481
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,719
being a prick exactly yes that's uh yeah

1482
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,078
some of the biggest [ __ ] you'll meet

1483
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,919
in the industry are those that have a

1484
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,039
little bit of knowledge that think they

1485
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,280
know a lot

1486
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,880
um absolutely i think that's called with

1487
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,480
the like dunning-kruger effect or

1488
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,119
something there's actually a

1489
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,400
um a model for that that you can look up

1490
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,640
there's a graph anyone listening that

1491
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,000
wants to look it up you can actually see

1492
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,318
uh this theory

1493
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,440
related to knowledge acquisition and

1494
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,358
confidence

1495
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,838
and um you know when you get a little

1496
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,279
bit of knowledge you often overestimate

1497
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,279
how much you know when you have a lot of

1498
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,200
knowledge you generally under represent

1499
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,480
how much you know because you've become

1500
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,838
humbled um and recognized that you know

1501
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,280
even the things i think i know a lot

1502
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,599
about

1503
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,000
you know who knows there's

1504
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,318
always more rabbit holes and and new new

1505
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,519
things to shine light on and everything

1506
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:54,960
um and one thing i wanted to make sure

1507
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:56,239
that we spent time on because i know

1508
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,679
that you're really into regenerative

1509
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:59,598
agriculture now

1510
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,039
and something we talked about before we

1511
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,359
started recording that i found really

1512
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,199
fascinating was that you've been trying

1513
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,838
to figure out how

1514
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,358
it might be possible to take

1515
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:12,159
you know permaculture regenerative

1516
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:13,519
agriculture principles

1517
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,399
and take them from the outdoor

1518
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,559
cultivation environment and find ways to

1519
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,599
integrate them in the indoor cultivation

1520
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,119
environment

1521
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,838
so before we wrap up i definitely wanted

1522
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,760
to make sure to spend some time

1523
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:27,440
speaking on that so i know we've talked

1524
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,119
about a little bit already off camera

1525
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,559
but um can you share a little bit about

1526
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,680
your recent

1527
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,480
indoor

1528
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,279
cultivation foray and um what you

1529
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,679
learned from that experience

1530
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,400
yeah so i've got to admit i um i have

1531
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:45,519
evolved my thinking and um again another

1532
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:48,798
thing that makes one uh humble yes uh so

1533
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,079
so for years i have been a proponent of

1534
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,639
only outdoor

1535
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,160
um i think that the quality of the

1536
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:56,558
medicine that comes out of outdoor

1537
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:58,239
plants that are grown under the sun is

1538
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:02,160
higher than indoor

1539
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:04,159
because the wider spectrum of light

1540
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:07,679
means that we are

1541
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,838
creating a wider terpene profile a a a

1542
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:13,679
stronger cannabinoid profile and just

1543
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:15,838
generally the plants thrive better um

1544
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:19,279
i understand the appreciation of indoor

1545
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:21,599
from its uh connoisseur level rag appeal

1546
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,680
and beauty but that's a different topic

1547
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,400
i really like the medicinal value of

1548
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:29,358
outdoor plants and i also didn't have a

1549
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,358
place to grow indoors and so i was i was

1550
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:33,440
you know i was an outdoor guy because

1551
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:37,039
that's all i had access to

1552
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,960
and and i you know i believe the gospel

1553
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,558
of northern california outdoor that

1554
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,480
that's like you know

1555
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,559
that's the best way to go

1556
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,519
and so that's what i've practiced um you

1557
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,319
know and

1558
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:51,599
and over the years i have increased my

1559
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,679
soil knowledge and using natural inputs

1560
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,400
and you know natural farming techniques

1561
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:58,000
and knf and and so i've got a you know

1562
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,200
i've got a pretty good sense of what i'm

1563
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,358
doing outdoors now and um and keeping my

1564
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,358
soil alive over the year and and using

1565
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,759
that same thriving soil the following

1566
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:08,719
year so that's great um

1567
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,200
however

1568
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,480
it became important to me to

1569
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,399
um

1570
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,519
do two things number one

1571
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,000
i needed new things to explore on the

1572
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,679
instagram the shaping fire instagram you

1573
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,119
know i've got i've got like what like 11

1574
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,118
000 followers

1575
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,880
and um

1576
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,200
and you know i'm trying to always

1577
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,119
provide helpful tidbits yeah well that's

1578
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,519
a lot harder to do if you're an outdoor

1579
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,559
grower during the winter yeah and i'm

1580
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:36,400
like you know

1581
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,240
let's see if i can let's see if i can do

1582
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,880
this stuff indoors

1583
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:42,558
and so um i uh

1584
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,400
in this new house that i moved into last

1585
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,760
year i've got i've got a little bit of

1586
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,559
room so i just set up a simple 4x4 tent

1587
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,720
and i'm a big fan of letting the plant

1588
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:55,359
roots talk to each other yeah and so

1589
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:58,239
instead of making individualized

1590
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:01,119
containers i set up a really nice four

1591
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:04,959
foot by four foot by um

1592
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:08,240
20 inch deep bed nice and then i used

1593
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,400
the um the layered biomimicry soil

1594
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:13,118
technique that um was taught by that

1595
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,358
stopped by leighton morrison um on my

1596
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,039
show and and so i asked him to get

1597
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:17,838
involved to make sure i did the bed

1598
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,159
right

1599
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,199
and i wild crafted all my

1600
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:25,118
inputs

1601
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:28,558
which was a pain in the ass

1602
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,480
i it's funny i highly recommend it for

1603
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,400
quality of flour

1604
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,440
but i don't recommend it for the amount

1605
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,838
of hassle um like i never realized that

1606
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,760
wild crafting silt was gonna be so damn

1607
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:44,239
hard and so and so anyway so i wild

1608
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,920
crafted everything for the bed

1609
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:47,919
and built it out

1610
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,200
and um and then

1611
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,838
um

1612
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:53,358
because in my head like i understand

1613
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:55,039
that there are indoors there's lots of

1614
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,279
options right there's you know there's

1615
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:59,279
there's hydro there's rockwool cubes

1616
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,119
there's all this other kind of stuff but

1617
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,559
but none of those are really how i do

1618
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:06,480
things i um um i like the uh

1619
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,400
you know um

1620
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,318
jeff lowenfeld says you know if if a

1621
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,798
worm can't live in it it's not really a

1622
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,558
growing medium and like i i know that i

1623
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,159
know that it's it's up for argument and

1624
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,559
and you know and and i'm not trying to

1625
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,879
pick a fight with the with the rockwool

1626
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,960
people but but for me that's where my

1627
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,680
head is is i wanted to use real soil

1628
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,358
biology because i'm a soil nerd yeah and

1629
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,679
so um

1630
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:31,598
so i wanted i started bringing in as

1631
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:34,078
many of the techniques that i could find

1632
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:37,280
from outdoors indoors

1633
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:40,480
and um did you know did my first run

1634
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,480
and i found um i i i found lights that i

1635
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,358
really liked i like their spectrum i

1636
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,079
like the the company's philosophy um and

1637
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,519
that's uh that's bios lighting they make

1638
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,400
they make really good lights for both

1639
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:55,039
humans and for and for cultivation

1640
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,960
they're actually a nasa spinoff company

1641
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:59,440
that their scientists helped developed

1642
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,240
the um the led growing setups for the

1643
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,559
space station which is as a as an odd

1644
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,639
thing i actually used to work on i was i

1645
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,240
was gonna say yeah

1646
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:10,000
yeah that's a funny thing to mention

1647
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:13,039
back i used to live in colorado for a

1648
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,679
while uh in late 90s

1649
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:18,719
and i worked for a technology company

1650
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:20,480
that was making rfid devices for a space

1651
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:23,118
hob what was the original name for the

1652
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,000
space station and so um

1653
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:27,358
you know stuff that i have touched um is

1654
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,719
you know theoretically still up in the

1655
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:30,400
space station so that's cool that's

1656
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,558
super cool

1657
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,920
got off the got off the the point but

1658
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,798
the the

1659
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,880
the first run out of the tent was like

1660
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:42,079
the best things i have ever grown in my

1661
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,640
life and like i i recognize how

1662
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,880
difficult that is too as a as a devout

1663
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,960
outdoor guy that i grew this stuff

1664
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,960
indoor that is without a doubt the best

1665
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,920
weed that i had ever grown

1666
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,318
and honestly it was like the top

1667
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,838
five things i had ever even smoked wow

1668
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:01,199
and i'm like oh

1669
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:03,519
and what i realized was how limited i am

1670
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:04,960
by how short and crappy our summers are

1671
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:06,159
where i live here in the pacific

1672
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,199
northwest

1673
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:08,078
um

1674
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,239
you know

1675
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,720
if you think about it a simple

1676
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,959
eight-week flowering period if

1677
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:19,519
if if the plants start to flower here

1678
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:22,400
around august 15th that's october 15th

1679
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:25,280
we are soaked and cold by october 15th

1680
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,119
yeah so really we only really get about

1681
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,798
five weeks of growing season before

1682
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,480
things start going to hell and i

1683
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:32,239
realized that um i'm actually a lot

1684
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,119
better grower than i thought i was it

1685
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:37,358
was that i was trying to grow well in a

1686
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,960
poor environment so as soon as i took

1687
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:40,960
those same regenerative techniques and

1688
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,639
brought them indoors

1689
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,880
i hit it out of the ballpark well that

1690
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,558
made me feel really good you know yeah

1691
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,400
year after year of getting beaten down

1692
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,880
by the bad weather right yeah i feel

1693
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,960
like a schmuck you know i'm like ah you

1694
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,480
know someday i'll be decent you know

1695
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,639
i'll just i'll just keep on learning and

1696
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,159
keep on plugging away and then i grow

1697
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:02,400
once indoors and it's like holy smokes

1698
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:03,440
and and so that that made me feel good

1699
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,240
um

1700
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,599
and so um i'm still torn right because

1701
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:10,959
um

1702
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,640
it really it was really satisfying to me

1703
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,199
to grow

1704
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:18,078
flowers that i could never finish here

1705
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:21,358
indoors and have them finish beautifully

1706
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,839
like really finish not like oh it needed

1707
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,679
10 more days outdoor right but we can

1708
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:27,199
take it now that's what i've been

1709
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,399
yeah

1710
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,000
well that stuff still you know that

1711
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,519
stuff's still great to process into

1712
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,079
tinctures and rso and stuff like that

1713
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,119
but it's not like fun to smoke yeah

1714
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,039
um

1715
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,200
you know because it's it's just not

1716
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:42,079
there but the indoor stuff is definitely

1717
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,960
there so so i'm at this new point now

1718
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,280
where

1719
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:50,240
um i am absolutely a lover of outdoor

1720
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,680
but because of where i live

1721
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:55,679
i absolutely see the need for indoor

1722
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:57,759
but if i'm going to do indoor i'm not

1723
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:00,239
going to be using bottles and rock wool

1724
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,720
and a and b formulas and stuff right i

1725
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,558
am going to be using like like

1726
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,558
whole nature

1727
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,920
soil additives

1728
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,119
wild crafted when i can do it

1729
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,559
responsibly but otherwise you know

1730
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,480
you know

1731
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,760
build a soil you know gives out you know

1732
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,079
cells a lot of really great inputs you

1733
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,640
know yeah and you know get stuff from

1734
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,079
like there and um

1735
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,159
and then

1736
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,400
leaving the only real problem for me the

1737
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:27,838
fact that i'm using electricity right

1738
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,200
right for my lights

1739
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:30,239
which um

1740
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,159
you know

1741
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,439
i try to you know have a small carbon

1742
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:37,920
footprint and i'm somewhere in between

1743
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,358
a i use so little electricity in the

1744
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,559
rest of my life

1745
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:46,000
and my carbon footprint is so small that

1746
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:48,160
if if i'm going to choose to

1747
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,440
spend my allotment electricity on the

1748
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:52,318
lights

1749
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:55,280
that's my decision to make yeah and and

1750
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:58,318
so i do that but even more importantly

1751
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:01,039
um i am aggressively researching and

1752
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:04,480
continuing to talk to um

1753
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:07,359
uh solar people because i think that

1754
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,760
when the day comes that we can

1755
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,679
um you know capture the sun and put it

1756
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,480
in batteries and have that push enough

1757
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:16,480
juice to run led lights it will

1758
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,440
absolutely remake the home grower

1759
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,280
industry yeah i totally think so um i i

1760
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,720
believe that that time is soon i don't

1761
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,640
think it's far away and so um so you

1762
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:29,279
know am i totally comfortable with you

1763
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,920
know using lights to grow indoors no

1764
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,480
but i picked good led lights that don't

1765
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,358
use a lot of electricity i am producing

1766
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:41,119
my own medicine which i think is legit

1767
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:45,759
and as soon as there is a a

1768
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:46,559
real opportunity to you know

1769
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,079
teach

1770
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:52,640
using solar at home for home grow

1771
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,559
i will have that show first yes

1772
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:55,679
i will be all into it so

1773
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,599
so

1774
01:03:55,679 --> 01:04:00,558
so yeah i'm in this transition place

1775
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:03,119
where um i am a devout outdoor grower

1776
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:05,680
who now has fallen in love with indoor

1777
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:08,720
and uh you know i'm like wildly excited

1778
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:10,879
about my second cycle coming up here so

1779
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,598
that's super cool and what did you uh

1780
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,119
what did you grow for your um for this

1781
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:18,960
first round of indoor experimentation

1782
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,680
yeah so um

1783
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,679
so

1784
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,199
before i go into it um people will be

1785
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,118
like probably shocked that i'm gonna

1786
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:27,439
name five plants

1787
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:29,680
um this was part of my learning curve

1788
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,079
five plants is way too many for a four

1789
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:34,159
by four tent

1790
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,960
so we will we will definitely cause you

1791
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:36,480
know

1792
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,318
tie that up to

1793
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,240
a learner's error and that's right i

1794
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:41,838
just wanted variety i wanted to finish

1795
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,318
five different things so i could try

1796
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,880
five different things but it was

1797
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:50,400
it like overgrew like crazy oh sure yeah

1798
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:54,480
um with it with that um the the

1799
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:56,480
i grew the the the hot hot bicket og

1800
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,559
that has been it was bred by nick

1801
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:02,318
reiston at lime rising farm that's a

1802
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:05,039
cross of uh gmo and cherry pie

1803
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:06,639
it is an absolutely delightful strain

1804
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,920
and then um

1805
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:12,719
i was uh given seeds um that were bred

1806
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,960
by my good friend and a very popular

1807
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,239
cannabis guy michael hinden

1808
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,960
who um

1809
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:20,639
who died a year ago now um um as a

1810
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,039
matter of fact i was on my way to pick

1811
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:25,358
up these seeds when i found out that he

1812
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:28,720
had been murdered um the prior day oh my

1813
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:30,719
gosh and um i was like at the airport

1814
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:33,199
going down to meet with leighton

1815
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,719
morrison in in

1816
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,960
in southern california then we're gonna

1817
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:39,038
drive to

1818
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,519
house and then i found out that that he

1819
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,880
asked and and so there's a lot of

1820
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,559
grieving there

1821
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,960
but then um

1822
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,480
you know his business partner

1823
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,838
you know

1824
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:54,240
uh widow um brianna reached out to me

1825
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:55,679
and she said hey you know um

1826
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:57,118
i knew it was going to do this thing

1827
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:00,399
with you and he was going to give you

1828
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:02,640
seeds for the patients on vashon

1829
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,039
and i still want to continue on with the

1830
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,078
things that that michael wanted to do

1831
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,680
and so

1832
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,240
she sent me um

1833
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,239
almost a complete set of of the modern

1834
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:14,000
epigenetics first release and they're

1835
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:16,639
all runs crosses

1836
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,239
and so that became extra special right

1837
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,679
because not only are these crosses that

1838
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,519
i was hot to grow

1839
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:24,078
but it's like michael right this is

1840
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,440
michael's work and so it became a real

1841
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,480
um

1842
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,920
um

1843
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,000
um you know

1844
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,960
labor of love for lack of a better term

1845
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,199
and so

1846
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,079
um we grew um

1847
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:37,838
i grew uh michael's secret stuff which

1848
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,720
is gmo runs

1849
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:41,599
and then also um

1850
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,318
um

1851
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,359
uh

1852
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:47,440
uh jet fuel og runs

1853
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:49,519
uh called private jet

1854
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,039
and that's a stinker that's a really

1855
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:52,639
great plan the michael's secret the

1856
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:55,839
michael secret stuff is a good plan

1857
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:58,798
because i like gmo but the jet fuel og

1858
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:01,440
runs it was just like nasty and caustic

1859
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:02,960
and stony it's really great

1860
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,679
and then

1861
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,358
and then the two opposite corners

1862
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:11,279

land race uh acapulco gold oh wow um

1864

1865
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:15,838
which was okay it didn't turn out as

1866
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,119
nicely as i had hoped it would it was

1867
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:19,920
beautiful it just didn't have a lot of

1868
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:24,079
nose to it yeah and then um and then i

1869

the obama strain so anyway so yeah but

1875
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:40,400

three plants which is probably still

1886
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,760
more than i should have but my goal is

1887
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,400
to to grow them and then just weave them

1888
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,599
back and forth yeah see how that goes

1889
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,920
you know one of the cool things that

1890
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,960
like since since i'm not cultivating for

you know because i was i was naive i

1906

just didn't have the experience and so i

1907
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,399
use those you know those things to teach

1908

1925
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,239
so that's okay

1926
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,079
we'll see where it goes

1927
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:33,439
and have you absolutely have you played

1928
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:36,079
around with um autoflowers at all

1929
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:38,318
oh yeah well um i've i fell in love with

1930
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:41,119
autoflowers and became a big proponent

1931
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:44,239
of them about three years ago um as soon

1932
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:48,079
as i learned what an autoflower was

1933
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:50,238
um by uh you know by by going into the

1934
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:53,198
fields in oregon actually in oregon near

1935
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,799
you um oregon cbd seeds oh yeah yeah

1936
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:55,919
seth and eric crawford right good

1937
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,279
friends of mine

1938
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:02,640
and so their first auto was a was a um

1939
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:05,198
all cbd hemp cultivar called rna really

1940
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,360
nice auto and when i was there and they

1941
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:09,039
explained to me how that's how they're

1942
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,198
not dependent on the sun they're

1943
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,198
dependent on you know their length of

1944
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:14,559
light and that they automatically mature

1945
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,319
and flower

1946
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,320
i'm all like holy hell

1947
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:24,238
patience everywhere that is not

1948
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:26,158
california needs these yeah because um

1949
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,399
so many of the genetics are designed for

1950
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,158
california weather and then and then we

1951
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:31,679
don't have california weather in most of

1952
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:32,719
the rest of the country

1953
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,640
and so

1954
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,560
the idea that um

1955
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,719
you know we can start something yeah

1956
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,320
june 1st and harvest it middle of

1957
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,359
september when we're all still in

1958
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,198
drought

1959
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:46,079
that was like

1960
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:47,198
and so i immediately dug into that hard

1961
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:49,119
um

1962
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:52,399
i started hunting out autoflower

1963
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:54,479
breeders and putting them on my show and

1964
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:57,359
um hunting out seeds so that i could

1965
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,479
grow and take pictures and learn myself

1966
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:01,759
and um

1967
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:04,000
hooked up with jeff lowenfels who

1968
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,000
put out a book on autoflowers

1969
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,079
and uh told him that when the book came

1970
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
out i wanted to have him on on my show

1971
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:11,359
for his first interview and that was

1972
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,520
cool he actually invited me to write

1973
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,158
something for the jacket

1974
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,920
on the jacket of nice so that's cool

1975
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:19,359
and uh and

1976
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,600
as we talked earlier you know i did a

1977
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,079
lot of traveling to teach about cannabis

1978
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,480
and i was usually being booked to talk

1979
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:27,679
about something patient oriented right

1980
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,839
and so

1981
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,600
my i guess this would have been two or

1982
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,119
two three years ago i don't know covet

1983
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,800
days everything matches

1984
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,399
yeah but but but

1985
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,279
you know about a year and a half before

1986
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:41,279
we started all the covety stuff um i was

1987
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:43,679
just touring going to conventions and

1988
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,719
teaching autoflowers which you know

1989
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,039
historically have a pretty bad

1990
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,760
reputation because the past seeds have

1991
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:52,079
been very low yielding pretty pretty

1992
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,920
weak but like the new generation of

1993
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:56,238
seeds are fantastic and you know they're

1994
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,399
not going to get to be monster plants

1995
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:00,079
that you know we all still love

1996
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:02,079
but like most people don't have the

1997
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,840
weather to grow those monster plants or

1998
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,359
at least to finish them right yeah you

1999
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,719
might be able to grow a monster plant

2000
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:08,960
but are the plant are the flowers ever

2001
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,039
going to finish yeah not most places in

2002
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,560
the country so anyway i kind of took the

2003
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,238
the autoflower

2004
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,600
gospel on the road

2005
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:17,759
and um

2006
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,600
and i reached out to lots of autoflower

2007
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,360
seed companies and i said hey do you

2008
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,719
want to sponsor my talk

2009
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:24,799
and all it takes for you to sponsor the

2010
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,560
talk is to send me a box of seeds that i

2011
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,520
can give away to patients after the

2012
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,840
talks

2013
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,679
and of course they're like hell yeah

2014
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,360
shango and so all these all these folks

2015
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,279
sent me seeds

2016
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:36,960
and i you know i asked everybody hey you

2017
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,679
throw in a couple extra for me so i can

2018
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,198
grow them and and put pictures on on

2019
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,960
instagram and i'll send you traffic

2020
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:44,079
they're like yeah we're good with that

2021
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,239
so

2022
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:47,760
so i would go to all these all these

2023
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:49,599
cities and give my talk about

2024
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,400
autoflowers and then say

2025
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,800
you know

2026
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:55,279
if you are a patient come up and get a

2027
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:58,159
seed pack if you have if you are not a

2028
01:12:55,279 --> 01:13:00,479
patient um don't come get a seed pack go

2029
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:02,238
go buy one from one of these seed

2030
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:04,319
providers go out on the floor and buy

2031
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,238
them at the show but if you know if

2032
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:08,960
you're if you consider yourself a legit

2033
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:11,119
patient come get packs it was great like

2034
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,119
patients are usually neglected right you

2035
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:14,719
know especially at trade shows because

2036
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:16,399
they've got no money to spend usually

2037
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,920
right yeah and so suddenly they're

2038
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,399
they're they're the ones getting the

2039
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,920
free stuff and it was like high quality

2040
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,839
good seeds

2041
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,440
and um so that was really good and i

2042
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,520
mean and it felt good it's good to be

2043
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:29,599
the conduit for that kind of love from

2044
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,719
the from the breeders to the to the

2045
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,320
patients

2046
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:37,439
and um and so i'm very grateful that the

2047
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:39,679
autoflower community has embraced me

2048
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:42,399
and even though i'm not a breeder all i

2049
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,560
want to do is is help spread their

2050
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,279
gospel and and why you should buy their

2051
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,400
seeds so you know um

2052
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:49,198
and um

2053
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:50,399
and

2054
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:51,599
i think they get that my heart's in the

2055
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:53,759
right place you know i'm not i'm not

2056
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,920
trying to take anything from the scene i

2057
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,880
i just want to make what i want to make

2058
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,279
their

2059
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,199
art history more popular and and we've

2060
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:04,319
done a great job so that's really great

2061
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:06,479
i am um you know even though um

2062
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:09,359
autoflowers still tend to get a lot of

2063
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,519
flack by a certain kind of grower um i'm

2064
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,759
really honored to be you know one of the

2065
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,000
people um at the at the forefront of

2066
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,679
teaching autoflowers absolutely i mean

2067
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
it's super fascinating to me for some of

2068
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,600
the very reasons that have come about in

2069
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,960
um just talking about your

2070
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,640
experimentation with indoor and

2071
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,640
everything um

2072
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:30,000
just thinking about how you translate

2073
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:33,039
cannabis cultivation to other places

2074
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,520
other than california and the lower half

2075
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:38,079
of oregon

2076
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,440
you know we have to

2077
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:40,640
expand

2078
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:42,879
our

2079
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,960
conceptions of you know of all of these

2080
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,440
things and recognize like you said that

2081
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,520
everywhere is not california um having

2082
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:52,799
that sort of arid environment and these

2083
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,400
long you know summers and everything um

2084
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,600
that's not gonna be the case and i

2085
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:57,039
mentioned before the interview started

2086
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,560
that i'm from the southeast and so i'm

2087
01:14:57,039 --> 01:15:00,479
keeping my eyes on

2088
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,560
you know tennessee north carolina

2089
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,319
arkansas all these places that are the

2090
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,239
hemp's starting to get big so they're

2091
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,559
jumping into large fields of cannabis

2092
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:09,519
cultivation and are recognizing like oh

2093
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,679
no

2094
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,040
like this doesn't this doesn't quite

2095
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,560
translate everything i've been reading

2096
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:15,760
and all these books and everything it

2097
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,960
doesn't quite

2098
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,640
match up um and so

2099
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:24,719
seeing experimentation with

2100
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:26,480
autoflowers um i find particularly

2101
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,079
fascinating from that perspective how

2102
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:30,718
can autoflowering

2103
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:32,079
varieties be used in places that

2104
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:33,840
typically do

2105
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:36,880
get a little more humid that the rainy

2106
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,719
seasons start really early

2107
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:42,319
or in places where you know you get

2108
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:44,239
these cold fronts that come really early

2109
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:46,238
seeing how that can be a bridge to

2110
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:47,359
especially because as places legalize

2111
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:48,879
cannabis

2112
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,519
they usually don't let you bring

2113
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:54,239
cannabis from other places uh other

2114
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,320
states and so you're stuck with you know

2115
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:59,198
in whatever state you're in once it goes

2116
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:01,359
medical or you know full adult use legal

2117
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:03,919
you've got to work with the climate and

2118
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,519
situation you have which is one reason

2119
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,359
why people often

2120
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,159
retreat i say retreat that's not the

2121
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:12,238
best way to put that but they they tend

2122
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:14,158
to default back to indoor because they

2123
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,119
just figure outdoor isn't even an option

2124
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:16,158
so

2125
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:18,800
it'll be interesting to see if

2126
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:21,119
autoflowers as they get

2127
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,800
bred and improved upon because they've

2128
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,679
definitely changed a lot since like the

2129
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,079
90s um i remember back in the day like

2130
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,359
the old um like high times magazines and

2131
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:30,880
stuff you know you'd start to see

2132
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:33,839
advertisements for

2133
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,279
auto flowers for closet grows um you

2134
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,119
know so that the plants would be small

2135
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:39,519
enough that you could keep in a

2136
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:42,800
a little grow box or you know people

2137
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,960
used to grow in like uh pc cases you

2138
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,800
know that they would outfit uh to grow

2139
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,439
plants in and so seeing

2140
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,400
autoflowers come from that you know kind

2141
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:53,519
of

2142
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:55,279
early start to where it is now is just

2143
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,640
really fascinating to see and it's got

2144
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:58,880
me really especially from a scientific

2145
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:01,360
perspective i'm like i want to do trials

2146
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,840
with autoflowers and start to look at

2147
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:06,319
the biochemistry of these things and and

2148
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,760
see if we notice any interesting things

2149
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:09,439
in some of these genetics that we don't

2150
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,800
see in other things because you never

2151
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:12,319
know until you look

2152
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,400
um

2153
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,840
so um yeah that's all fascinating and

2154
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,759
something i definitely wanted to to

2155
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,520
check on because it seems like for

2156
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,360
a place like washington that would

2157
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,920
definitely be the way to go as far as

2158
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:25,839
outdoor cultivation

2159
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,359
for sure i mean the the some of the

2160
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,840
early autoflowers that i was growing

2161
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:32,719
were like 100 days but but this summer i

2162
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,760
got to grow a bunch of 60 days wow

2163
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:36,719
wow

2164
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:39,280
like that's wow fantastic fantastic

2165
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,359
autoflowers over 60 days

2166
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:42,800
and you know they're not big plants but

2167
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:44,479
you know just like we were talking

2168
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,760
earlier about individualized medicine

2169
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:47,759
for patients

2170
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,119
you need individualized genetics for

2171
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,520
growers yes

2172
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:53,119
you know a lot of patients you know okay

2173
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,880
great it's it's wonderful that they

2174
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:56,238
could potentially grow a 12-foot plant

2175
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,319
but how the hell are they going to take

2176
01:17:56,238 --> 01:18:00,319
that down you know people with mobility

2177
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:02,639
issues yes or who are growing in a

2178
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:05,279
backyard and they don't want to get

2179
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:07,360
their stuff ripped right yep for their

2180
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,359
there are particular growers that

2181
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:11,439
growing a

2182
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:14,399
two and a half three foot maybe a four

2183
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:16,079
foot plant that's going to stay short

2184
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:17,839
but maybe they grow a few more of them

2185
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:20,079
so they have some variety

2186
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,239
there are people who who don't need the

2187
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:24,800
traditional monster plant because that's

2188
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:26,559
not what they need and so in the same

2189
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,800
way that we talk about

2190
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,960
individualized medicine i like to talk

2191
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,560
about individualized cultivation yeah it

2192
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,119
isn't that one's one seeds are

2193
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,760
necessarily better than the other it is

2194
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:40,800
the the seeds highest use for that

2195
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:43,360
particular cultivator and um you know i

2196
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,560
think it's another other way that we as

2197
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:47,759
educators

2198
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,679
can encourage people to uh you know be

2199
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,199
be in service to

2200
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:53,199
you know the people that we're trying to

2201
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:55,119
educate whether or not they be you know

2202
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:57,919
people who identify as patient growers

2203
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:59,359
or just home growers or

2204
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,760
or you know

2205
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:04,079
extractors right it's it's all about you

2206
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,079
know being in service and

2207
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:08,960
so that the individual cannabis

2208
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:11,439
enthusiast can choose which attributes

2209
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,800
of our scene work best for them yeah

2210
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:15,519
it's i

2211
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,440
it drives me nuts when people compare

2212
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,920
like growing styles like how you are

2213
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:21,439
growing is wrong like dude you're

2214
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,920
talking to this guy on facebook or

2215
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:26,079
instagram how do you know anything any

2216
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,960
of the details of this person's needs

2217
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:28,719
right

2218
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,399
like like person will figure out what

2219
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,840
works best for themselves don't worry

2220
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,719
about yelling at them that they're an

2221
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,679
idiot

2222
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:38,000
absolutely i think that's that that uh

2223
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,880
yeah kind of goes across the entire

2224
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,520
industry in general um i think as the

2225
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:46,000
industry's like kicking off um

2226
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,320
and people are much more public

2227
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,880
with their cannabis usage and growing

2228
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:54,319
and everything yeah you see so much

2229
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,239
typical human dynamics bickering and

2230
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:58,158
posturing and comparing and everything

2231
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:00,238
and it is important to make that note

2232
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:02,319
that everyone

2233
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:05,198
has their own

2234
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:07,039
relationship and specific

2235
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:08,638
uh situation that they're in that

2236
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:09,439
they're gonna find things that work for

2237
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:11,920
them

2238
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:13,839
and there are lots of options

2239
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,039
um and so

2240
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,000
getting caught up and trying to

2241
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:19,920
understand what's best um right away is

2242
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,238
just kind of a

2243
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,840
kind of a fool's errand um it's yeah

2244
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:27,039
what's best for you

2245
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:29,039
um is is definitely a great message to

2246
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,800
get out there i also just glanced at the

2247
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:32,158
time just noticed between

2248
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,079
our cuts we've probably gone on for like

2249
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,879
an hour and a half here so i want to be

2250
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,760
respectful of your time i apologize for

2251
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,239
not

2252
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,039
noticing that sooner

2253
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:43,039
but

2254
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:45,119
this has been a wonderful conversation

2255
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:46,639
chango and

2256
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,119
i wish we could go on for another hour

2257
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:50,480
and a half or two because um

2258
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:52,639
especially as we get going here and

2259
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:54,399
comparing stories and stuff um there's

2260
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:56,960
so much that's popping in my brain

2261
01:20:54,399 --> 01:21:00,479
memories and things from

2262
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:02,960
the past 10 years or so um

2263
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:05,599
that uh yeah there's there's so much to

2264
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,119
learn from uh from where we've come from

2265
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,679
and and where we're going and i guess

2266
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:12,559
the last question i'll pose to you is

2267
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:15,279
what do you hope to see from the future

2268
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,719
um as cannabis you know i say the

2269
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,198
cannabis industry but when i say the

2270
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:21,279
cannabis industry i really just mean the

2271
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,678
widespread proliferation and

2272
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:25,759
normalization of cannabis you know

2273
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:28,079
broadly whether that's in the legal

2274
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,400
market or home growing or you know

2275
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,559
whatever manifestation that has but what

2276
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:35,519
do you hope to see from the future of

2277
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:37,199
the cannabis industry as we move into

2278
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,679
you know the next several years five

2279
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:42,158
years or so

2280
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:44,639
well start with the most uh difficult

2281
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:46,238
thing that i would like to see and um i

2282
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,520
would like to see

2283
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:48,399
um

2284
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,840
more

2285
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:54,319
states

2286
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:57,039
adopt and hold a one acre cap like they

2287
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:59,279
were supposed to have in california

2288
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:01,279
but then the lobbyists got beaten up so

2289
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:03,279
that people are now stacking licenses in

2290
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:05,119
california because originally there was

2291
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:07,039
supposed to be a window of opportunity

2292
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:09,439
for small heritage growers and family

2293
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:12,719
farms to get well established in the

2294
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:14,799
market before the big commoditized

2295
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,840
cannabis companies were supposed to be

2296
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:21,199
able to to do anything in california

2297
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,400
and um effective lobbying by

2298
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:24,799
big money

2299
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:26,399
totally made that disappear just one

2300
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,920
night in the morning it was gone and no

2301
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:31,279
one was willing to talk about how that

2302
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:34,480
happened yeah and so i'm hoping that um

2303
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:37,599
as we see the the rise and strength of

2304
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:39,198
these msos these multi-state operators

2305
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,440
which are essentially like you know

2306
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:44,399
mcdonald's for weed right right that the

2307
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:45,439
quality is is is not you know what it

2308
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:47,839
could be

2309
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:48,799
and um it really commodifies the whole

2310
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,760
thing

2311
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,840
i hope that that many states learn from

2312
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,400
the california mistake

2313
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,360
and they create situations in their

2314
01:22:56,399 --> 01:22:59,679
states

2315
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:01,519
that that is the opposite of what

2316
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:04,239
they're doing now which is

2317
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:07,520
trying to beckon these multi-state

2318
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:10,238
operators so that they can deal with

2319
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,000
fewer providers

2320
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:13,759
and just make the whole thing easy for

2321
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,079
themselves instead of doing the thing

2322
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:19,039
that should be done which is

2323
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:21,600
letting small players grow in their

2324
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:24,639
state and then

2325
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:28,000
exporting those companies to into other

2326
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:30,560
states that did not do a one acre cap um

2327
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,479
i'm asking a lot in that i know um but

2328
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,880
that's the that's the number one thing

2329
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:37,119
for me is i would love to see something

2330
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,520
happen where the small guy can start to

2331
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:41,279
compete more effectively with these with

2332
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,000
these msos

2333
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:46,639
um second no surprise i'm super excited

2334
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,880
to see the future of autoflowers yes and

2335
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:51,119
um and um you know because we're still

2336
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,960
very early in the process and and so

2337
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:53,920
much has happened in such a short amount

2338
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,679
of time

2339
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,880
and now that this is the pool that i'm

2340
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:01,039
swimming in more and you know then then

2341
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,600
photo periods um you know i still keep

2342
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:06,000
my hand in photo periods but but really

2343
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,840
i think um for for the the regular

2344
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,119
homegrowner and patients the future is

2345
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,760
autoflower

2346
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:13,519
and so um i'm very excited to see what

2347
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,719
happens there

2348
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:18,800
and then

2349
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:21,480
i'm also uh excited with the

2350
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:24,639
um what do you want to say like like the

2351
01:24:21,479 --> 01:24:26,319
standardization of cannabis knowledge

2352
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,319
because right now there's still a lot of

2353
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:30,719
bro science in the teaching of the

2354
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,799
endocannabinoid system and you know

2355
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,319
people you know like uh you know people

2356
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,760
they thinking they need an indica for

2357
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,559
this and a sativa for that when

2358
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:41,199
indicative is a is a false thing it

2359
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,719
doesn't even exist in reality right it's

2360
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:44,479
just shorthand because people aren't

2361
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:47,279
educated properly enough

2362
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,359
and as as uh you know prohibition

2363
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:51,119
continues to melt away into some kind of

2364
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:53,039
normalized thing

2365
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:55,519
i look forward to people

2366
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:58,079
more uniformly understanding how

2367
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,120
cannabis can help them and relieve their

2368
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:02,158
symptoms

2369
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:05,039
so that people are doing less trial and

2370
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:06,799
error and more oh i'm using the best

2371
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:09,279
practices that we've already learned and

2372
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,279
shared yeah so i would say those three

2373
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:13,279
things are the things that um you know

2374
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:14,960
are three of the things that i'm most

2375
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,800
excited to see come

2376
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,800
yeah i mean those are huge you know that

2377
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,880
first one you mentioned i know it's a

2378
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,960
it's a big ask but i

2379
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,800
completely agree because once again i

2380
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,279
mean i saw similar things happen in

2381
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,800
oregon you know like

2382
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:30,559
starting in these labs and getting to

2383
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,600
know these medical growers and these

2384
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:36,000
small farms and small businesses

2385
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,719
you get emotionally invested in wanting

2386
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,719
to see them succeed as the industry is

2387
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:42,960
starting to come about and then when you

2388
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:45,359
see them get totally crushed and

2389
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,520
basically no hope of being able to

2390
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:50,158
participate in any way

2391
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:53,199
um i mean it's not just sad like it's

2392
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:55,279
it's wrong it's just wrong

2393
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:56,638
um and

2394
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:58,960
so i'm i'm

2395
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,639
i want to just echo that that um

2396
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,158
absolutely that's something that needs

2397
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:05,440
to get more

2398
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:08,879
attention as more and more states um

2399
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:10,238
uh changed their laws um because i i do

2400
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,400
worry that

2401
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:15,519
we're already kind of knee-deep in this

2402
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:17,679
process of kind of excommunicating

2403
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,360
all of the folks who

2404
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,480
got us to this point basically the

2405
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:23,198
people that

2406
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:24,959
took the risk early on uh participating

2407
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:27,919
in either straight out black market or

2408
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:30,560
gray you know gray market areas that

2409
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,039
stuck through medical all the way up to

2410
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,719
recreational and now we're trying to

2411
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:37,600
decide what to do

2412
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:39,520
to make a living because you know it

2413
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,560
doesn't seem like growing is going to do

2414
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,639
it anymore those i'm i'm sad to hear

2415
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,639
more and more and more of those stories

2416
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:49,520
as more time goes on a lot of people in

2417
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:51,920
oregon i know lots of good great growers

2418
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,880
that have abandoned growing

2419
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,158
because

2420
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:58,719
the money's just not there anymore um so

2421
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,960
um yeah i i totally feel that so that

2422
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,880
one in particular i just want to make

2423
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,239
sure people are really thinking about

2424
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,159
especially if anyone listening to this

2425
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:08,638
has any um

2426
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:10,799
sway in any of these states that are you

2427
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,199
know currently discussing legislative

2428
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,199
changes

2429

yeah all great things um

2430
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:20,079

things about like me as another cannabis

2469
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,520
enthusiast that stuff that doesn't

2470
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:41,519
necessarily fit the shaping fire brand

2471
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,639
um i also want to plug the shaping fire

2472
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,120
youtube channel which is really

2473
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:48,400
different because um even though there

2474
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:50,399
are certainly um

2475
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:52,879
the audio files from

2476
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:55,439
the the shaping fire podcast are there

2477
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:57,600
for you to listen to as well

2478
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:59,519
the reason people love the shaping fire

2479
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,320
youtube channel is because that's where

2480
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:04,239
i post all of my random videos from

2481
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:06,559
doing shaping fire so

2482
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,559
you'll get you know lots of farm tours

2483
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:11,039
farm tour outtakes when i go to

2484
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,080
conventions everything that i see at the

2485
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:14,719
convention

2486
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:16,639
i i record all of those speakers and

2487
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:18,639
bring them home for people who don't

2488
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,960
have access to it the youtube channel

2489
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:23,039
was nothing that i like intended to do

2490
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,560
it was just that when i got home from

2491
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,000
traveling i had all these videos where

2492
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,440
the hell am i going to put them and so i

2493
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,560
just started dumping them onto the

2494
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:32,399
youtube channel and now like you know

2495
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:35,520
um there are there are hundreds of

2496
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:40,158
videos there and um you know we've got

2497
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:42,239
you know 10 or 13 000 subscribers and um

2498
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:44,238
and i think we just recently hit like

2499
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:46,638
you know our one millionth viewer so

2500
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:49,279
nice so it's really popular and so so

2501
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:51,119
that's kind of fun and um yeah i think

2502
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,800
that's it so but the center of that

2503
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:54,559
universe is shaping fire.com and

2504
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,719
honestly if you just put shaping fire in

2505
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,360
google you'll find it all yeah

2506
