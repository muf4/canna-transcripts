2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,759
the community of cannabis cultivators

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,980
has always been tight we had to be for

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,859
most of our Lives we were persecuted and

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,240
in some jurisdictions we still are that

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,400
persecution meant that we couldn't

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,399
access many of the botanists we'd like

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,500
to talk to and that meant there were big

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,618
parts of cannabis cultivation that was

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,500
kind of in a biological Black Box we

11
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,659
couldn't see what was happening inside

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,058
all we knew was what we were doing and

13
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,359
then what was coming out the other side

14
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:41,459
now though between the creeping personal

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,039
legalization we've got and the internet

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,960
we can now access the minds of

17
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,719
scientists who support our efforts to

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,399
grow magnificent thriving and medicinal

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,500
cannabis plants

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,558
today's one of those episodes where we

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,659
get to look inside that black box during

22
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,820
today's episode we will examine the

23
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,979
relationship between the cannabis plant

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,019
and the soil life and get a better

25
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,359
understanding of how they talk to each

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,040
other and how they work together for

27
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,840
Mutual benefit in this intimate

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,000
relationship

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,618

biologist Sarah Lane Sarah Lane is

53
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,059
wrapping up her PhD in plant and

54
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,938
cellular biology at University of

55
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,219
Victoria her work primarily focuses on

56
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,139
route exudates that are involved in Iron

57
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:08,818
uptake in plants and their potential

58
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,159
medicinal benefits

59
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,378
Sarah consults for licensed cannabis

60
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,079
cultivators in Canada and is an avid

61
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,239
living soil cannabis home grower due to

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,580
her University Research needs she is

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,080
also very experienced in fog ponics and

64
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,000
hydroponics

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,280
Sarah has a wicked large Plant

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,020
collection and is currently designing a

67
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,340
specialty terrarium for growing Cloud

68
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,500
orchids

69
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,039
during the first set of today's episode

70
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,840
we will focus on what exudates are their

71
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,219
biological mechanics and how they

72
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,800
interact with microbes and other

73
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,479
residents of the rhizosphere during the

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,819
second set we will talk about the

75
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,780
relationship between exudates and fungal

76
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,839
Networks

77
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,699
signaling varieties of exudates and

78
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
address the challenges of a 24-hour

79
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,119
light cycle

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,420
we finish up the third set discussing

81
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,920
exudates and salt-based fertilizers

82
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:01,500
exudates and soilless growing mediums

83
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,079
like Coco coir and the misconception of

84
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,539
using unsulfured molasses to replace the

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,940
nutrition that exudates provide

86
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,378
welcome to shaping fire Sarah

87
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,878
hey it's great to be here thanks for

88
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:14,518
having me oh yeah thank you so much for

89
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,500
joining us and sharing your expertise so

90
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,680
let's Jump Right In you know I think

91
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,459
that most people who cultivate cannabis

92
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,640
who have even heard of exudates

93
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,680
um only really know that exudates are

94
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,939
something that the cannabis plant gives

95
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,560
off and that the microbes eat and like

96
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,780
that's pretty much it it's the it's the

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
food it's the the plant feeding the

98
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,280
microbes and that's about it and and you

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,319
know we know that that's actually overly

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,299
simplistic and misses the big picture so

101
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,639
so why don't we start by kind of getting

102
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,939
everybody on the same page and if you

103
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:54,899
would explain what exudates are

104
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,818
okay so exudates are basically all of

105
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,860
the different molecules and components

106
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:00,839
that the plant makes in the roots that

107
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,879
are like given off to the rhizosphere so

108
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,620
there's a bunch of stuff inside the

109
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,298
plant cells and inside the root that

110
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,039
happens and then eggs dates are

111
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,438
everything that the plant makes

112
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,239
specifically to to transport out into

113
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,098
the soil and there's lots of different

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,978
types of exudates they can be sugars

115
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,539
they can be amino acids they can be

116
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,399
um specific types of secondary

117
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,439
metabolites which are not used for

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,359
nutrition and there's many many

119
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,660
different functions of them as well

120
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,360
so just to give us an idea of of like

121
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,060
how many different exudates there are

122
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,879
are we are we talking about like like

123
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,819
there's there's there's like five

124
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,500
buckets or 50 buckets or a hundred

125
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,599
buckets like how many how many varieties

126
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,579
are there just just in general

127
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,040
oh goodness that's a tough one there

128
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,599
there honestly are so many different

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,340
types of exudates and we're just

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,199
scratching the surface of what exudates

131
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,779
actually are like off the top of my head

132
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,419
like functionally there's probably like

133
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,698
20 different groups of exudates that I

134
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:01,859
know of personally but I think exudates

135
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,439
are extremely hard to study because they

136
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,780
are in the soil and The Roots so I think

137
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,839
we'll probably keep finding new ones

138
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,579
over time this is Kai I get the idea now

139
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,500
that this is kind of like asking you how

140
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,198
many uh types of bacteria are there

141
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,680
there's just like a ton in nature and

142
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:22,620
and we're constantly finding more as our

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,780
technology gets more sensitive so true

144
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,259
yep that's definitely the case all right

145
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,418
so um like to help illustrate uh what

146
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,120
some of these exudites are can you give

147
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,680
us like like three different examples of

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,538
exudates that you know maybe you

149
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,759
particularly like just so that we can

150
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:40,019
kind of wrap our head around

151
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,419
um you know

152
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,758
what what they do

153
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:46,560
sure um so so I mean the ones that I

154
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,639
work with specifically are called

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,860
finally

156
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,439
they're actually sort of a group of

157
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,000
molecules that come from the process of

158
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,079
building up lignin but they have lots of

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,819
different uses

160
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,199
um and those include things like some of

161
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,478
them are complicated ones or chlorogenic

162
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,280
acid which is actually found really in

163
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,800
high amounts in coffee so people might

164
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,379
be a little bit more familiar with it

165
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,939
there's also amino acids like um that

166
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,819
not only are used for protein building

167
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:14,219
but plants can make special non-protein

168
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,439
amino acids that are really useful in

169
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,759
finding out things like fishing out iron

170
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,399
out of the soil and that kind of thing

171
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,240
and then the other one is flavonoids

172
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,638
there's actually a bunch of different

173
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,259
types of flavonoids which is a big huge

174
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,300
super group of different types of

175
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,080
molecules and they're involved in

176
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,538
everything from antioxidant Behavior to

177
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,939
um even signaling to mycorrhizae and

178
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:39,060
things like that all right so so you've

179
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,139
mentioned um uh I think that I think

180
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,139
I've pulled out like three different

181
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,139
categories from your examples there

182
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,699
there would be like um like this the

183
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,800
only ones I was aware of the nutrition

184
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,300
right um and then it said and then

185
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,079
you've mentioned signaling a couple

186
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,939
times and then and then um you you

187
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,159
sounds like there are some that actual

188
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,779
like process

189
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,180
um

190
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,559
uh like things like nitrogen and things

191
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,060
like that they're like more like kind of

192
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,939
like worker bees

193
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,660
um is that do do all of exudates roughly

194
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,819
fall into these three categories or um

195
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,660
or are there many more categories to

196
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,660
like what they do

197
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,000
interacting with nutrients directly

198
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,740
which is kind of where my expertise is

199
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,680
um there's signaling back and forth like

200
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,598
talking to bacteria or fungi or that

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,180
kind of thing where they interact with

202
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,519
the microbes and the microbes interact

203
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,000
back and then there's another big group

204
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:45,000
that are almost like anti-herbicidal

205
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,098
or or a herbicidal story and those ones

206
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,439
are responsible for sort of clearing the

207
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:50,939
way for the plant to grow

208
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,740
um I'm sure there's more than that but I

209
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,259
think that's kind of like the big huge

210
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,598
groups so I think I have an overly

211
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,280
simplistic understanding of the back and

212
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,978
forth because the way I normally think

213
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,198
about the relationship with the plant

214
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:06,478
and the uh the microbes and the rest of

215
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,538
the life and the the rhizosphere is that

216
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:13,860
during the daytime the plant will

217
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:15,360
um uh be fed by the microbes and and the

218
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,419
rest of the players in the rhizosphere

219
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,819
during the day and then during the dark

220
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:24,359
period the plant will then turn around

221
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:26,879
and send uh the the required nutrition

222
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,280
back into the rhizosphere and so it's

223
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,979
like a it's like a back and forth like a

224
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,500
tide thing dependent on

225
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,718
um you know whether or not it is day or

226
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,700
night cycle for the plant which is kind

227
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,000
of quarterbacking this back and forth is

228
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,860
how I generally think about it but um

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,659
but that may very well be way too

230
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,300
simplistic so so will you kind of

231
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:50,699
explain how it goes back and forth

232
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,559
yeah so I think like the basic idea of

233
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,720
signaling is is a little bit like

234
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,399
texting it's it's not so much that the

235
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,560
plants are providing nutrition directly

236
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,299
to the roots although in some cases from

237
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,278
the roots to the microbes although in

238
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:03,539
some cases it is and it's not always

239
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,059
that the microbes are providing

240
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,679
nutrition back to the plant there's a

241
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,079
lot of signaling that's going on and

242
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,239
that's kind of like if you can imagine

243
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,560
um you know being at home and hey can

244
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,299
you pick me up some milk from the

245
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,619
grocery store but it could also be like

246
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,359
hey I've got cookies when you've got

247
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,500
home when you come home and that kind of

248
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,820
thing so that's kind of what I mean by

249
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,159
signaling

250
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,100
um and that signaling happens all day

251
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,379
every day at any time so there is some

252
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,820
regulation with light interacting

253
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,500
obviously the light drives

254
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,580
photosynthesis and that kind of thing

255
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,259
and when the plant is on it's often

256
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,899
needing a lot of different types of

257
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,299
activities like nutrient acquisition and

258
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,120
maybe it's doing some you know stress

259
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,019
responses to help against pests or

260
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,060
something like that and a lot of this

261
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,519
happens in the daylight I don't think we

262
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,739
know enough about whether or not it

263
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,480
happens in the dark

264
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,459
because the roots are always in the dark

265
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,139
technically sure does that make sense

266
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,299
yeah it does um you know the way that

267
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,458
you described it this kind of like all

268
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,519
these different

269
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:08,759
microbes and uh and

270
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,440
protozoa and then the plant exudates all

271
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,379
kind of calling out to each other and

272
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,880
signaling you know pick up milk or I

273
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,519
have cookies when you get home and like

274
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,320
and if everybody is doing that I

275
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,620
suddenly got this idea of like this

276
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,320
cacophony of signals back and forth and

277
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,179
like shopkeepers calling out what's on

278
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,160
sale and kind of like some kind of like

279
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,799
big Turkish Bazaar and like everybody

280
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,539
trying to you know give everybody's

281
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,338
attention

282
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:38,519
um is that a is that a reasonable

283
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,899
picture of of what's going on it's a

284
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,278
beautiful picture of what's going on I

285
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,620
really do think that's exactly what's

286
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,360
happening because they're like we often

287
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,860
think about it being just the plant and

288
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,079
the microbes interacting with each other

289
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,659
but the microbes interact with each

290
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:54,838
other too and with fungi end with

291
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:58,500
different um organisms around like it is

292
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,600
just a huge web of different organisms

293
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,820
talking to each other and sometimes that

294
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,440
is like you know selling your chips on

295
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,420
the you know or the hot dog stand or

296
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,760
whatever and maybe it is advertising for

297
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:10,979
sale and it's very very very complicated

298
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,620
and it's something that I think we wish

299
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,720
we knew more about but trying to dissect

300
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,240
what each of those components is

301
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,740
contributing to the soil life or even

302
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,680
just how the plant is growing in the

303
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,180
soil is really complicated I like that

304
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,859
though yeah and it's strange too because

305
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,578
like I've always kind of thought as of

306
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,800
the soil as while a violent place often

307
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,539
um uh you know pretty calm actually like

308
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,278
it's it's kind of serene in there but

309
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:37,740
it's probably because of the level of

310
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,320
magnitude I'm like I'm living on this

311
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,480
human level of magnitude but if I could

312
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,459
see really closely under a microscope

313
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,500
I'd be I'd be

314
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,778
seeing all this activity in the

315
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,659
rhizosphere and so it's only quite

316
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:53,939
because like I I can't hear it

317
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:56,338
absolutely it is very barely Controlled

318
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,399
Chaos down there let me tell you

319
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:03,360
so do we have a any technology or any

320
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,399
way to gauge the amount of

321
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,259
you know rambunctious signaling that's

322
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,820
going back and forth like there is is

323
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,078
there any kind of like a you know

324
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,079
anything that we can like put into the

325
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,479
soil to gauge signaling that's taking

326
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,059
place in the soil

327
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,500
um I think it's it's pretty complicated

328
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:21,539
but there's some interesting things that

329
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,919
go on so like I guess it depends on what

330
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:25,379
level so what we're talking about right

331
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,299
now is on the chemical level and really

332
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,939
the the way that a lot of people are

333
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:32,278
doing this is either bulk so they take a

334
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,680
big sample of soil and then measure it

335
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,360
for different types of organisms or

336
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,219
different types of signals that they're

337
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,440
producing but then trying to tease that

338
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,060
out we can tell differences like maybe

339
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,500
between different types of soil or

340
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,599
different types of communities different

341
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,339
types of plants that kind of thing

342
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,079
um but I think it'd be really hard to

343
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,760
pick out which one is responsible for

344
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,338
exactly which one and so the other

345
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,159
option is to take an individual plant

346
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,320
and an individual organism and see what

347
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,819
they do together just the two of them

348
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,180
and it's one of the real challenges with

349
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,519
like soil ecology or or like ecology in

350
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:07,379
general is just trying to pull out you

351
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,459
either have to treat it as a whole and

352
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,799
just accept that you don't understand

353
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,958
the individual relationships

354
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,879
um or you have to get in there and try

355
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,979
and tease them apart one by one does

356
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,299
that make sense it does so let's talk a

357
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,740
little bit about

358
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,559
um a couple of these different varieties

359
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,899
so um the the one that we've talked

360
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:29,119
about the most so far is are the

361
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:31,500
signaling and so we understand

362
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,600
you know what they're trying to Signal

363
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,899
like like I have this type of nutrition

364
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,339
or or maybe I need this type of

365
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,159
nutrition

366
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:44,700
um how are they doing that are they

367
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:47,458
doing that um primarily uh chemically or

368
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,339
is an electrical charge or what is at

369
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:52,379
that um very small level what is the

370
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,620
mode of communication

371
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:57,000
it is it is chemical I mean there for

372
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,159
the most part

373
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,379
um it is like plants if we go back to

374
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,179
the exudate thing like these plants are

375
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:05,578
making these very highly specific

376
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:08,278
molecules they're basically in some

377
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:10,739
cases like an invitation and then those

378
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,600
are actually like taken up by the

379
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,940
microbe in question

380
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,180
um and that changes what the microbe can

381
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,279
make so it actually interacts um after a

382
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,199
long signal being Cascade inside the

383
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:23,220
cell it'll interact on the genome and

384
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,680
then they'll be able to produce

385
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,600
different types of molecules based on

386
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,599
that information and then that ends up

387
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,240
getting made and exuded out by the

388
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,360
microbe and then maybe that's an RSVP

389
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,399
response card back to the plant and then

390
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,720
they kind of do this back and forth or

391
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,339
sometimes it might just be like they

392
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,959
actually make a different molecule and

393
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,760
that molecule has been transported into

394
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,619
the plant cell does that make sense yeah

395
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,519
and it's super cool actually I mean the

396
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:53,639
idea that that the the the the signaling

397
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:56,698
exudate kind of like combines with the

398
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,560
microbe and between the two of them they

399
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:01,979
developed this superpower that's the

400
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,179
only way that what is necessary is

401
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,639
produced

402
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,799
I mean that's pretty cool that's a very

403
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,600
complex complex yeah

404
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,979
I think it's awesome I think I think

405
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,659
it's also important to note though that

406
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,839
what we're talking about there is like a

407
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:17,278
pretty symbiotic relationship

408
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,500
um and there is going to be some

409
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,179
opportunistic stuff too because you know

410
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,000
plants are making stuff that maybe it

411
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,859
has one purpose but the microbes can use

412
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,419
it for something different so

413
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,980
it uses it for something different it

414
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,620
produces some other stuff and those

415
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,240
different types of molecules have like a

416
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,919
happy accident to the plant could use

417
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,198
some of them too like sometimes it is

418
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,639
more like a a free bin than it is

419
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,578
something that's like really organized

420
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,560
but um yeah there can be both happening

421
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:45,659
all right I like this idea of invitation

422
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,059
microbes too

423
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:50,879
um all right so so if they are all

424
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,619
speaking to each other through subtle

425
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,679
chemicals

426
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,679
um for for those of us who are you know

427
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,179
we're adding things to our soil all the

428
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,000
time you know this fertilizer or that

429
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:05,638
fertilizer or you know some kind of soil

430
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,720
trench with like an fpj in it or

431
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:11,879
something

432
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:14,639
um how easy is it for us to disrupt that

433
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,500
chemical signaling back and forth

434
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,659
um just like let's say that you know I'm

435
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,600
talking with a friend in my yard and a

436
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:23,338
plane flies over you know relatively low

437
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,959
because I live near an airport and we

438
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,279
just have to like stop talking for a

439
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,439
minute and wait for the plane to fly

440
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,539
over is there anything that that we

441
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,660
could potentially do as cultivators that

442
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:36,000
would be so air quotes loud in the

443
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,439
rhizosphere that everybody have to talk

444
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,500
stop talking for a minute because we

445
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,199
just dumped something in the soil see I

446
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,480
think unless it's water like probably

447
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,099
everything we add is disrupting things a

448
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,659
little bit it's a bit like getting a

449
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,120
shipment you know everybody stops to

450
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,039
bring in the delivery kind of thing I

451
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,419
think that is also true of microbes

452
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,879
because they're responding to the to

453
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:58,139
whatever you've added as well but I

454
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,879
think I think all of them are going to

455
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,860
be disruptive I think it's more how long

456
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,838
because like for example if you're just

457
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,000
adding water or some nutrients like

458
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,939
depending on how light or how much

459
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,199
nutrients you're adding it might be like

460
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,579
really short term and they can use up

461
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,798
those nutrients pretty quickly and then

462
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:15,659
they're back to doing whatever or maybe

463
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,939
it's more long-term and you've really

464
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,339
altered the soil chemistry enough that

465
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,439
like maybe something dies off or those

466
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,779
kind of things I think those are all

467
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,160
things that could really disrupt and I

468
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,959
think especially with nutrients because

469
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,700
a lot of what we're talking about is the

470
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,980
plant signaling four nutrients or

471
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,480
something related to nutrition

472
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,038
um that that's probably one of the

473
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,900
things that would turn off signals from

474
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,240
a plant like they don't need to get it

475
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,620
from the microbe if you're providing it

476
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,538
um and I think that that might be

477
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:43,558
something else that would really I don't

478
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:46,679
know that would definitely be a plain

479
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:50,160
overhead situation sure I want to take

480
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,179
one more step along this disruption idea

481
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,220
um

482
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,700
specifically with with water I mean

483
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,819
clearly the soil requires uh water so

484
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,100
that things can have Mobility

485
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:06,178
um but sometimes you know a a cultivator

486
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:08,459
will just over water terribly and um and

487
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:11,100
it can you know drown lots of varieties

488
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,600
of microbes or or you know cause them to

489
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:16,740
cyst up and depending on the on the

490
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:18,480
variety can we drown exudates to to the

491
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,359
point where you know we kind of like

492
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,360
wipe out a whole I don't know generation

493
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,699
of them and and the what the soil that

494
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,439
needs to dry out and then the plant

495
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,720
needs to restart

496
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,759
I think I think yeah like if you're if

497
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,779
you're like uh watering to run off and

498
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,640
stuff like that there's certainly stuff

499
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,440
that's leaching out of the soil and some

500
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,820
things are kept more by the soil than

501
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,900
others so when we talk about these

502
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,418
molecules

503
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,940
um a lot of them are charged and some of

504
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:46,620
the charged like the positively charged

505
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,480
um types of molecules tend to stay in

506
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,379
soil better than negatively charged ones

507
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,000
do

508
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,799
um so you could definitely like flush a

509
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,660
lot of things out that way but I think

510
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,639
the time scale for production of

511
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,700
exudates by the plant it can replenish

512
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,740
pretty quickly it's not um it's not on

513
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,240
like the you know days weeks or months

514
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,400
sort of situation like those cells are

515
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,140
making a lot of stuff really rapidly and

516
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,059
some of the responses can happen within

517
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,160
seconds I don't think it'll be seconds

518
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:12,599
to make the exudates again but the idea

519
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,419
that they might need to make more of

520
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:17,038
them is a pretty quick one so I mean it

521
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,259
you might you might disrupt it like

522
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,759
really temporarily I think the biggest

523
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,220
danger with over watering is probably

524
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,140
damage to the roots or like promoting

525
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,538
the growth of anaerobic bacteria or

526
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,660
pathogenic species that kind of thing I

527
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:33,119
follow um so so that was we were just

528
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,919
talking about the signaling variety and

529
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,139
so let's talk about the nutrition

530
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,600
variety and it sounds like some of the

531
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,240
signaling ones actually do end up

532
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,279
playing a role in getting nutrition for

533
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,960
the plant themselves as well

534
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,700
um what's the difference between like

535
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,240
that kind of activity and the ones that

536
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,279
we were putting in the nutritive

537
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,038
um exudates bucket

538
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,440
I think those ones are more direct so I

539
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,359
mean everything is happening at like a

540
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,740
chemical level so the chemistry of the

541
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,819
molecules can interact with the

542
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,038
chemistry of the soil and just

543
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:08,279
completely bypass the microbes so for

544
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,019
example I work with iron iron is really

545
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:11,519
hard to get out of the soil there's lots

546
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,779
of it but it's kind of like it's locked

547
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,759
up like a rock

548
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,639
um and so the plants will actually make

549
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:20,038
molecules that can go and sort of fish

550
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,780
it out from the Rock and interact

551
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:23,700
directly with iron molecules and then

552
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,379
that is brought over to the root and it

553
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,240
can be taken up that way some of things

554
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,860
like nitrogen and phosphorus and things

555
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,779
like that I think there's certainly like

556
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,000
either they're making it a more

557
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,619
favorable environment for those ions to

558
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,019
just kind of like those molecules to

559
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:40,019
just be available for uptake

560
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,179
um or they're actually able to like drag

561
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,440
it in some some plants those non-protein

562
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,700
amino acids that I was talking about

563
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,620
earlier

564
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,179
um some plants like grasses will make

565
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,579
those and they actually just kind of

566
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,620
pick up the iron like a little basket of

567
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:54,418
eggs and actually bring it inside the

568
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,099
cell so they can they can interact

569
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,480
certainly with molecules to Signal back

570
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:58,859
and forth to tell them to make other

571
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,058
things and bring it in but they can

572
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,519
actually just interact with the

573
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,740
nutrients directly as

574
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,660
um as that molecule and bring it in as

575
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,380
well does that make sense it does so

576
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:13,200
when um when cultivators kind of like uh

577
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,320
Loosely say you know oh this this

578
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,179
fertilizer is is plant ready or that

579
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,220
fertilizer needs to be you know

580
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,980
processed in the rhizosphere before the

581
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,319
the plant can take it is is it these

582
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,599
exudates that that we're talking about

583
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:30,119
that are doing that work of coming

584
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,538
across you know nutrition or minerals or

585
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,879
whatever in the soil and the exudates

586
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:38,400
are what are you know breaking it down

587
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,100
and and putting it into a form term that

588
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,140
can interact with the actual root Zone

589
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,699
that's certainly part of it yeah for

590
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,620
sure and like one group we haven't

591
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,600
talked about is low molecular weight

592
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,699
organic acids

593
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,079
um which are like really really small

594
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,819
basic

595
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,500
um uh that's one that I can think of off

596
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,158
the top of my head

597
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,900
um

598
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,799
like citric acids and things like that

599
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,620
plants can make those and that will just

600
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,240
make it easier to take up is that sort

601
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:07,259
of what you were talking about yes yeah

602
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,579
yeah

603
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,679
um because you know most of the time we

604
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,599
just talk about that uh you know you

605
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,280
know casually using like contemporary

606
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,819
language and and not the science

607
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,798
specific language so to kind of like

608
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,178
you know accidentally come across it

609
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,679
it's kind of been kind of exciting it's

610
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,880
like oh this is what we're talking about

611
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,080
all the time and we don't know what

612
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,080
we're talking about that's great

613
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,740
like this big component of like when we

614
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:33,000
talk especially about living soils and

615
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,579
things like that there's there's

616
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,058
everything at the end of the day is

617
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:39,960
assault even if it's from an organic

618
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:41,819
material or something like that it's

619
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,759
being broken up into these little tiny

620
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:46,740
ions that we call salts and um and the

621
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,658
the I guess it's just a matter of

622
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,460
whether it needs help to get to that

623
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,960
state or whether we're providing it as

624
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,400
that state and anytime we're talking

625
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,900
about these like exudates helping like

626
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,059
they're basically trying to put it into

627
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,519
that form so the plant can take it up

628
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:00,899
so then um the third bucket we were

629
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,460
talking about

630
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,538
um were

631
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,279
um I don't know for lack of a better

632
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:07,619
term I'll say allopathic they're they're

633
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,480
kind of like like I don't know almost

634
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:12,658
military they're where they where they

635
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,720
go and they are hurting the plant

636
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,620
enemies is that like the general idea

637
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,538
sort of yeah

638
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,418
um so allelopathic chemicals are these

639
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:23,819
sort of now herbicides that some and not

640
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,740
all plants make them but some plants

641
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,359
make these types of exudates that

642
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,798
basically act as like a herbicide or a

643
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,599
fungicide or something like that to

644
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,339
clear the way so it's made by the root

645
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,639
The Roots going through the soil and

646
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:38,038
like leaving this material behind that

647
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,720
is really toxic to some plants and that

648
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:40,980
kills off neighboring roots and that

649
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,200
kind of thing and lets it grow better

650
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,058
and invasive species are often really

651
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,340
good at making these kind of things in

652
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:48,960
the plants that are here already don't

653
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,359
have any defense against them and so it

654
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,620
just kills them off so I know I asked

655
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,319
you that question in kind of like a

656
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:57,959
general way have we found cannabis

657
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:00,658
plants making this particular kind of

658
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,919
War making exudate yet do we have we

659
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,600
seen that in cannabis I mean I know

660
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,720
we're still just learning what cannabis

661
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,459
puts out but have we found that yet not

662
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,860
to my knowledge they're pretty unique

663
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,259
situations when this is a thing um like

664
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:15,058
for example walnut trees black walnut

665
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:16,798
trees you cannot grow anything under a

666
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:19,019
black walnut tree for a huge radius

667
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,700
because that's how toxic it is but

668
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:22,200
cannabis you can plant quite a few

669
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,058
plants right next to it it doesn't seem

670
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,380
to do anything so if it is it would be

671
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:26,339
on maybe like

672
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,200
I don't know maybe it would be

673
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,399
anti-fungal or something like that but I

674
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,960
don't think it actually has anything

675
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,759
like this that would kill off plant

676
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,960
roots like that that's a great example

677
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:35,220
because that's actually what I was

678
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,038
thinking about I was thinking about oh

679
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,960
maybe maybe this is why some of the

680
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:41,819
companion planting that we put with

681
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,620
cannabis is more successful than others

682
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,418
maybe the the cannabis plant is actually

683
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,759
trying to choose its neighbors

684
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,080
it certainly can and like all these root

685
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,480
things that we're talking about like it

686
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,339
influences the soil environment and that

687
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,200
environment is going to be hospitable to

688
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:56,759
some other plants and less hospitable to

689
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,319
others maybe not because it's directly

690
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,298
killing off the plants but just because

691
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,700
maybe that plant doesn't enjoy those

692
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,019
kind of conditions the same way all

693
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,019
right so we talked about the signaling

694
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:09,480
kind and we talked about the the the the

695
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:11,940
the allopathic kind and we talked about

696
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,700
the the processing that are going to go

697
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,860
and you know free up nutrition in the

698
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,840
soil and then I think the last category

699
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:22,500
that we haven't covered is is are the

700
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:25,199
exudates that are themselves nutrition

701
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,000
so so what kind tell us a little bit

702
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,880
about the exudates that the plant puts

703
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,319
off that is nutrition itself

704
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,820
these ones are kind of complicated

705
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,099
because I guess it depends on what what

706
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:37,500
isn't necessary but a lot of things that

707
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:39,599
are carbon based because carbon is

708
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,940
basically what we talk about like like

709
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,038
sugars and things like that or what end

710
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,860
up being used to make energy so I think

711
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:50,038
that a a lot of different types of root

712
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:51,719
eggs dates could be nutritious to other

713
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:53,158
organisms provided they can break them

714
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,839
down and use them

715
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,480
um so I think like

716
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,058
um a lot of the metabolites I work with

717
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,919
we think might be getting

718
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,658
um eaten up by bacteria which are like

719
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,759
the the acids and things like that

720
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,260
anything that has a sugar attached

721
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,000
because a lot of these molecules are

722
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:10,859
combinations of these different types of

723
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,900
groups so you can have an acid that's

724
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:15,298
attached to a sugar for example like all

725
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,340
of those would be possible nutrients

726
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:19,798
since you brought up carbon

727
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:21,778
um I want to ask you a question it's

728
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:23,278
kind of a

729
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:25,919
I don't know where this might take us is

730
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,960
what I want to say is that last night I

731
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,759
was talking to a soil biologist Leighton

732
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,100
Morrison on the phone about how excited

733
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,079
I was about our interview today and he's

734
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:35,699
like oh exits are great they're like

735
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,220
liquid carbon

736
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,558
and and I wasn't sure what he meant but

737
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,558
I figured I would ask you about him and

738
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:46,798
say are exudates like liquid carbon

739
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:49,200
a little bit actually so a lot of um

740
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,079
like there's there's a huge number of

741
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,819
atoms out there in elements um but the

742
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:57,119
ones that are most common in organic

743
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:59,460
chemistry and and life are carbon oxygen

744
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:03,418
nitrogen phosphorus

745
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,640
um hydrogen and sulfur and so most of

746
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,960
these tiny like it's just those six like

747
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,759
there's and obviously there's other

748
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,500
things like iron and plants need

749
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,240
manganese and magnesium and all these

750
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,440
other different Metals but like a lot of

751
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,079
these molecules that we're talking about

752
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,778
today are based off of those

753
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:21,119
um those six so when we're talking

754
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:22,859
liquid carbon like the a lot of these

755
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,658
molecules have a carbon skeleton so

756
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:27,240
they're mostly carbon and as long as

757
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:30,360
something can break the carbon apart and

758
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,880
use it in their in their biology though

759
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,399
that's food does that make sense I get

760
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,760
it so so I want to talk a little bit

761
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,519
about the the nature of the signaling

762
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,579
I'm curious to know whether it's more

763
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,038
more push or pull

764
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,379
um when the signaling happens and

765
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:53,220
perhaps it's both is it more like

766
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:55,559
putting out a sign that says you know I

767
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,140
have cookies for sale if you want

768
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:02,339
cookies come over to me or is it more

769
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,140
like placing an order where one one side

770
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:07,678
of it either the microbe or the plant

771
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:10,559
will will put out a request to the other

772
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,200
side for what they specifically need

773
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,759
I think it's it's sort of both and it

774
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,200
really depends on which specific

775
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,759
interaction you're talking about but I

776
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,080
kind of like to think of it more like a

777
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,720
conversation like there's going to be

778
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,220
some asking questions and like I need

779
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,259
this but there's also going to be like

780
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,120
I'll give you this too

781
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,460
um and so I and it also happens over

782
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,558
multiple Cycles so it's not just like a

783
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,298
one message in one message back sort of

784
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:35,158
thing like these Cycles can have

785
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:37,558
multiple signals back and forth does

786
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,380
that make sense yeah it does so where in

787
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:43,139
the plant are the exudates made are they

788
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,419
made like in in one particular exudate

789
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,538
Factory or is it like made all all over

790
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:51,179
the plant in in many places

791
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:53,460
I think to be honest I think it's

792
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,080
complicated I think that our general

793
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,759
understanding of where exudates are

794
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,319
produced is usually the root tip because

795
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:59,700
that's the growing part of the root and

796
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,319
it's the one that kind of has to be the

797
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,759
most responsive to the different things

798
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,019
it's encountering as it's moving through

799
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,480
the soil

800
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,038
um as far as like where on the root like

801
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,839
it's it's going to be on the surface

802
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,759
cells mostly because they're the ones

803
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,918
that are directly next to the

804
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,419
rhizosphere which makes sense but I

805
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,100
think a lot of different types of

806
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,840
molecules and signals to make those

807
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:20,459
molecules can come from all over the

808
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,220
plant too like different parts of the

809
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,659
root can ask for different things

810
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,919
um different parts of the shoot like the

811
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,000
growing part of the plant that we see

812
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,038
all the time

813
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,140
um that can also trigger different

814
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,700
things to be made as well

815
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,080
um but I think like the cells right on

816
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,819
the outside of the root are the most

817
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,379
responsive to that kind of stuff and

818
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:38,700
it's different too because above that

819
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,620
growing zone

820
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,058
um there might be there's still exits

821
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:43,079
being produced but they might be

822
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:45,359
different because there's different

823
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,038
needs if you're already there

824
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,199
um with all the different needs and all

825
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,419
the cacophony and how small this is I

826
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,399
can imagine that there are so many

827
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:54,480
exudates next to each other next to each

828
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:56,038
other next to each other that they're

829
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,919
nearly tripping over each other because

830
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:01,440
there's so much activity happening yeah

831
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:07,020
a little bit of a soup yeah

832
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,759
um so the um are the exudates like stuck

833
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:11,460
where they are and they they're only

834
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,919
mobile if there is water around or do

835
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,038
they have some kind of solution for

836
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,679
Mobility for themselves that that kind

837
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,960
of depends on the chemistry so like in

838
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,519
general they're going to be mostly right

839
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,380
next to the root and then they're just

840
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,000
going to kind of diffuse

841
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,980
um to places where there's less of them

842
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,480
same as like if you were to dump a bunch

843
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,159
of salt into the glass eventually the

844
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,778
salt would all dissolve into the water

845
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,120
but they would be most concentrated in

846
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:37,140
the bottom unless you Stir It Up so it's

847
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,579
kind of like that if you imagine the

848
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,200
bottom of the glass is like the cell so

849
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:42,720
it's being made right at the bottom

850
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,700
there and then kind of diffuses up and

851
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,620
eventually it'll get pretty far away but

852
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,538
but not too far

853
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:50,158
um and then it depends on the type of

854
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,919
molecule because

855
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,620
they're mostly water soluble but there

856
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,778
can be some that are kind of more

857
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:59,759
lipophilic or like oil loving that might

858
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:01,380
move differently they might be more

859
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,140
likely to stay next to the cell that's

860
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,179
more like that and maybe don't don't

861
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,919
travel as far away from the root does

862
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:10,080
that make sense yeah it does and and it

863
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,538
doubly makes sense because

864
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,939
um you know the theme of all of your

865
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:17,158
answers have been it's complex and it

866
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,159
depends on which one and I'm starting to

867
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,980
realize that you know most of most of

868
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,440
the generalizations that we might make

869
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,839
about exudates

870
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,240
um really don't apply to everybody like

871
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:33,298
it's hard to make generalizations about

872
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,759
exudates so so I guess I guess we'll

873
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:39,480
kind of like wrap up this first set with

874
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,619
um what is it about exudates that make

875
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,038
them

876
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:46,379
uh be exudates because if if they all

877
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:48,179
act in different ways and move in

878
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,940
different ways and signal in different

879
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:53,759
ways and do different things there's got

880
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,340
to be some thing that they all have in

881
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,538
common that makes them exudate so what

882
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:00,418
what is that

883
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:02,759
honestly it's just location

884
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,320
um I think is like the the biggest thing

885
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:05,879
that connects all of them because as you

886
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,500
say we have there's lots of different

887
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,760
functions for them there's lots of

888
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,200
different types they have lots of

889
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:11,759
different different jobs and interact

890
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,399
with different things but they're all

891
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,980
outside the root they're all made by the

892
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,538
plant specifically for being out in the

893
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,120
rhizosphere and that's the thing that

894
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:24,538
ends up connecting all of them so so the

895
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:27,178
exudates are created outside of the root

896
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:31,019
or or it's made in the root and then

897
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:33,000
it's shoved out of the root it's made in

898
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,558
the root and shoved out like like I was

899
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,579
saying earlier like those those cells

900
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,619
that are right on the surface of the

901
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:39,658
root they're making them inside and then

902
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:41,699
packaging them and then sending them out

903
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:44,278
into the rhizosphere that kind of

904
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,500
reminds me of the uh of the um

905
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:49,259
endophytic bacteria that we talked about

906
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,720
a couple shows back about you know the

907
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:54,658
thing that makes that makes it a

908
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,538
bacteria endophytic is that it spends

909
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:59,399
some amount of its life inside of the

910
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:02,879
plant and so it goes you know it'll go

911
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:06,000
in and out of the plant and so perhaps

912
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,120
exudates are you know things that start

913
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,960
in the roots and then and then they are

914
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,959
pushed out

915
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:21,119
that's as good a definition as any all

916
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,340
right great okay let's go ahead and take

917
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,199
a short break and be right back uh you

918
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:27,298
were listening to shaping fire and my

919
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,100
guest today is plant biologist Sarah

920
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:30,599
Lane and you know without these

921
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:32,699
advertisers shaping fire would not

922
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:35,278
happen so uh please support them and let

923
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,558
them know you heard them on shaping fire

924
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,960
thank you

925
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:42,119
online cannabis seed Distributors often

926
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,860
seem to be all the same but Multiverse

927

have sold out some shops simply buy

935
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:02,699
breeder minimums but I get messages all

936
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,918
the time from breeders saying some

937
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,419

as a collaborator with breeders trying

952
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:39,719

979
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,260
for years organic cultivators have been

980
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:39,239
looking for a peat moss replacement peat

981
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,920
moss has long been the go-to soil

982
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:43,139
amendment for water retention and

983
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,900
container growing but organic Growers

984
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:48,299
are recognizing now that peat moss is an

985
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,300
unsustainable resource and the mining of

986
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:54,119
peat bogs destroys Wetland habitats and

987
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,039
releases sequestered carbon but peat

988
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,980
moss works so well that many have

989
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:01,380
continued to use it now there is finally

990
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,838
a revolutionary replacement for peat

991
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,000
moss that provides better benefits while

992
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:09,420

one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1025

growing is so valued by Farmers is

1026
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,639
because the mycelium networks in the

1027
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,160
soil remain established from year to

1028
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,900
year and we know these fungal networks

1029
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,239
are essential because they are the

1030
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,460
nutrient super highways that extend far

1031
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:44,039

Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

1034
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,059
is that it takes most of the plant's

1035
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:52,460
life just to create these mycelium

1076
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,599
my guest today is plant biologist Sarah

1077
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:36,119
Lane so during the first set we talked a

1078
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,519
lot about kind of exudate mechanics and

1079
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,039
and what they are so that you know we

1080
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:42,960
could get an idea of you know get our

1081
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,960
heads wrapped around this this

1082
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,599
interesting chemical that's in the

1083
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,639
rhizosphere and and what it does and so

1084
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:54,000
on on during this set we're going to

1085
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:57,259
focus more on on what they actually do

1086
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,920
and how this I don't know

1087
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:07,380
cacophony or Symphony takes place so

1088
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:11,099
how specific are the signals for either

1089
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:14,099
nutrition or the the signals to telling

1090
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:16,320
exudates to go out in like you know mine

1091
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:19,380
some manganese or something

1092
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,260
um Are there specific exudates for all

1093
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,079
of these processes or or is it like when

1094
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,680
when you tell somebody hey would you

1095
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,240
pick up bread but I don't tell them what

1096
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:34,379
kind of bread I'm trying to get an idea

1097
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:37,559
of how specific the the requests are

1098
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,760
oh another theme of the day it's

1099
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,358
complicated

1100
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,880
um

1101
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,380
I think that in some cases it's

1102
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,300
extremely specific especially when we're

1103
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,700
talking about symbol like symbiotic

1104
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,859
relationships like rhizobium or in

1105
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:51,659
legumes or mycorrhizae and that kind of

1106
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:53,400
thing it's like very specific to the

1107
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:55,618
point where it's species specific it's a

1108
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,119
specific molecule that has one job and

1109
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,220
that is to go and signal to a

1110
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,440
mycorrhizae fungal um interactions and

1111
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:02,939
things like that so it can be that

1112
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,760
specific but there's also some that have

1113
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,440
sort of more of a like a broad like it

1114
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,520
has multiple different types of

1115
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,139
chemistry

1116
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,639
um it might be maybe a more complicated

1117
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:14,098
molecule where one end does one thing

1118
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,078
and the other end does another thing

1119
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,420
um and sometimes the plant can make

1120
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,180
multiple things to do the same job so

1121
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,820
some of the the tasks that that the

1122
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:25,679
exudates do especially the the ones that

1123
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,380
are sent out for nutrition and probably

1124
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:31,199
similarly the ones that are sent out for

1125
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,119
uh like like inert things like manganese

1126
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:37,199
or iron or whatever

1127
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:40,680
um those jobs sound familiar or similar

1128
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,179
to the role of mycorrhizae and and you

1129
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:44,039
know we often talk on the show about how

1130
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:46,618
the fungal networks are like super

1131
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,838
highways that are that will go out and

1132
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:50,820
soars these different

1133
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:52,980
um nutritions that are needed by the

1134
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,180
plant and then kind of uh bring them

1135
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,400
back and there's there's this

1136
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:59,639
relationship there I would think that

1137
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,320
since this this task is very similar to

1138
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,420
the exudates or at least how they're

1139
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,780
described there's probably a lot of

1140
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,338
exudate interaction with the fungal

1141
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,680
network is this true

1142
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:12,119
yeah I would say that's true so I think

1143
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:14,159
there's like there's two components like

1144
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,500
one the exudates can do a similar job

1145
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,118
but on a much more

1146
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,219
um tiny scale because they don't travel

1147
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,200
very far and so if they need to go

1148
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:23,699
farther out for the nutrients then the

1149
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,858
exudates would interact with the

1150
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:28,078
mycorrhizae directly and a lot of that

1151
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:29,460
is basically initiating infection it

1152
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,560
sounds weird to say infection when I

1153
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,900
don't mean pathogenic but essentially

1154
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:37,139
the plant has to invite the mycorrhizae

1155
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,820
especially uh Endo mycorrhizae to infect

1156
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:40,199
it and that's a very specific signal

1157
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,079
that's sent out to interact with the

1158
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,899
with that fungus to allow it to come and

1159
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,400
join the plant and it has to be in a

1160
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,720
situation where the plant would need

1161
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,639
that so I think

1162
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,739
like if the plant is deficient in

1163
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,379
phosphorus for example it might interact

1164
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:56,939
with mycorrhizae more whereas if it's

1165
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,318
not that deficient or if there's plenty

1166
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,460
of phosphorus next to the root maybe it

1167
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,019
interacts with that less and the

1168
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,338
exudates that it makes for itself will

1169
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:04,079
do the job does that make sense yeah

1170
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:07,500
that does make sense

1171
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,500
um is it possible to like over tax the

1172
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,780
exudate system so if the plant is

1173
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,059
you know making these exudates and and

1174
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,599
everything that the plant

1175
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:20,400
uh does takes some amount of I don't

1176
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,220
know energy or life force or effort

1177
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,880
depending on what level we're looking at

1178
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:30,299
um if the exudates are so busy

1179
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:35,160
um Can the exit 8 speed be working so

1180
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:36,599
hard that it makes the plant uh less

1181
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:39,899
thriving

1182
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,300
I think that kind of depends so I think

1183
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,260
if the plant is unhealthy that might be

1184
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,760
true

1185
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,400
um we often talk about things like a

1186
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,619
carbon budget though so there's a

1187
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,180
certain amount of carbon that a given

1188
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:54,180
amount of plant

1189
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:56,039
um can fix uh and there's a given amount

1190
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:58,919
of nutrients it can take up just based

1191
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,800
on its biology and Physiology

1192
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,900
um and so carbon budgeting depend that

1193
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,940
that means that different parts of the

1194
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,639
plant will be allocating carbon to

1195
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,880
different places so if for example it's

1196
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:14,039
suffering a massive thrip wave it will

1197
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,260
be busy making carbon

1198
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:19,259
containing compounds to deal with that

1199
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,119
and it might make less exudates but if

1200
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,400
it's perfectly healthy all things

1201
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,720
considered it will make what it needs

1202
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,240
um and it'll make the amount that it

1203
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,779
needs does that make sense yeah it does

1204
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:32,519
um so it

1205
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,560
so where what I was going to ask was

1206
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:38,159
that you know are there things that we

1207
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:41,519
can do that would stress the exudate

1208
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,960
process and and signaling exchange and

1209
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,420
then you threw the thrip thing on the

1210
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,880
end so perhaps the answer to the

1211
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,280
question that I was going to ask is like

1212
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,318
anything that stresses the plant is

1213
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,220
going to call on the exudates to have to

1214
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:58,559
do more work so don't stress your plant

1215
00:44:55,219 --> 00:45:01,259
basically yeah or it's going to divert

1216
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,000
the resources of the plant elsewhere

1217
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,160
um I think like there's a certain amount

1218
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,960
we call it basil or base there's a

1219
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,719
certain amount of like maintenance level

1220
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,280
things that the plant makes everywhere

1221
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,279
um but it will respond to different

1222
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,380
stresses by taking as much carbon and

1223
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,619
nutrients as it can to whatever that is

1224
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:22,500
so if it's if it's happy and healthy

1225
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:25,500
then it can like pump up those base

1226
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,480
levels and everything's great if it's

1227
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,159
really under stress somewhere else it

1228
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,079
might take what it would normally make

1229
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,699
in The Roots it might take some carbon

1230
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,839
from that and and send it somewhere else

1231
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,098
and that might mean that you have

1232
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,440
there's still probably going to be some

1233
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,059
exudates there but it'll probably mean

1234
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,740
that there's less of them does that make

1235
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:42,239
sense yeah it does and so for somebody

1236
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,959
who's listening to what you're saying

1237
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:49,799
like me and and my brain goes to

1238
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:52,980
um you know what can I do to not stress

1239
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,140
out the exudate creation like that's a

1240
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,659
that's nice that I'm thinking about that

1241
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:59,639
level of my plant but really that's

1242
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:02,639
that's not really necessary I really

1243
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:05,818
should go up a level of magnitude and

1244
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:08,400
and think about not doing things that

1245
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:11,219
stress out the plant and then just let

1246
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,559
the exudates manage themselves

1247
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:15,959
essentially yeah like I think if you

1248
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,239
take care of your soil and you take care

1249
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,099
of your your plant and and they're both

1250
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,838
in good shape then you shouldn't have to

1251
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:23,880
worry about it for sure okay I mean

1252
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,858
making sure that your soil is healthy is

1253
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,500
definitely a big part of it I'm making

1254
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:30,000
sure the plant isn't you know being as I

1255
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,380
said mulled by thrips or something like

1256
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,420
that is also helpful I don't think

1257
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,338
anybody wants that anyway but

1258
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,599
um those kind of things making sure it's

1259
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:37,799
getting enough water it's not over

1260
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,480
watered

1261
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,220
um you know all those all those things

1262
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,260
that we generally try and make sure our

1263
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:44,639
plants have anyway if your plant is

1264
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,400
healthy there's not really anything

1265
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,818
extra that you need to do

1266
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,858
um I think we we've I think compost teas

1267
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:56,039
are one thing that you can do to kind of

1268
00:46:52,858 --> 00:46:58,078
help with soil life and things like that

1269
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:59,400
um and that might help with the exudate

1270
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,019
situation but most of the time it's

1271
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,760
really out of your control

1272
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:05,280
well it's kind of nice to have something

1273
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,800
that you know we're learning about this

1274
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,319
process but it isn't another thing that

1275
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,660
we have to like technically worry about

1276
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,039
right if you do your if you do your

1277
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:14,699
regular

1278
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,400
um

1279
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:19,559
your regular living soil kind of stuff

1280
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,300
like like this will take care of itself

1281
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,480
which is great because we already have

1282
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,519
enough to worry about right yep um we'll

1283
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:31,440
talk more about uh compost tea a little

1284
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:36,059
bit later but I want to wade into

1285
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:38,280
um a uh a pretty Fierce debate in the

1286
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:40,739
Cannabis world and um and I'm a pretty

1287
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:44,160
heavy participant in it and I have been

1288
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:46,139
looking for someone like you to weigh in

1289
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,598
on it so so I'm going to pull you into

1290
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:49,679
this debate and this is on 24-hour light

1291
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:54,720
cycle

1292
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:58,919
so the the the debate is generally about

1293
00:47:54,719 --> 00:48:02,818
um does the 24 hour light cycle is it

1294
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:05,880
best for the plant or does it uh starve

1295
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:07,920
the the soil from nutrients and the idea

1296
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,460
kind of goes like this

1297
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,579
um uh some Growers like to use 24 hours

1298
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:17,838
light because it causes the plant to

1299
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:21,599
grow more quickly and you can either

1300
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:23,279
grow a bigger higher higher yielding

1301
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,380
plant

1302
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,480
um during that time or during you know

1303
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,920
its regular life cycle

1304
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,719
um because

1305
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,680
um

1306
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,059
um you know because it's just getting

1307
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,578
more light

1308
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:38,039
um or you can actually shorten the cycle

1309
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,660
by using more light which you know

1310
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:42,119
allows you to perhaps get in another

1311
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:44,818
growing cycle over the year and so a lot

1312
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:47,039
of people use 24 hours of light now the

1313
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:51,480
flip of it which happens to be where I

1314
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:54,480
stand is that no 24 hours of of of light

1315
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,760
indoors is not going to create the best

1316
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,619
plant because while it makes it grow

1317
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,380
faster

1318
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:06,240
um you're not allowing the back and

1319
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:09,300
forth of the the the light phase and the

1320
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:12,358
dark phase both both phases are

1321
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,818
necessary so that the the the the

1322
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:17,039
exudates and the signaling and all the

1323
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:20,279
processes that happen when the the plant

1324
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:24,420
is awake with the light it needs to have

1325
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,519
some dark times so the contrasting uh

1326
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:30,480
signaling and exudates can happen so you

1327
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:33,539
you need both so all varieties of

1328
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,300
exudate signaling can happen and and all

1329
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:39,599
of the varieties of of nutrition and and

1330
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,700
those things can go back and forth so I

1331
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,460
have a feeling that the the answer is is

1332
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:48,059
probably somewhere in the middle

1333
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:51,420
um but specifically to this 24 hours of

1334
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:54,719
light question how does 24 hours of

1335
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:58,019
light impact this relationship between

1336
00:49:54,719 --> 00:50:00,019
the plant and the rhizosphere as far as

1337
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:03,358
the exudates playing a role

1338
00:50:00,019 --> 00:50:06,480
oof that is a spicy debate isn't it yeah

1339
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:08,279
um I think again to the theme of the day

1340
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,818
it's complicated

1341
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:14,160
um I have not ever seen anybody be able

1342
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:15,539
to because of the complexity of the

1343
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,759
rhizosphere and all the stuff that's

1344
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:20,159
going on there I haven't seen anybody

1345
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,740
actually be able to put this into a

1346
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,960
scientific study where we're able to say

1347
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:28,318
definitively if you give a plant 24

1348
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:32,099
hours of light the eggs dates suffer

1349
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:33,599
um so it's really in the middle I think

1350
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:35,400
um there's a couple different things

1351
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,079
that I can think of off the top of my

1352
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,700
head if if it's okay if I ramble for a

1353
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,760
second no please no we want to get into

1354
00:50:38,699 --> 00:50:43,019
this so go ahead perfect okay so light

1355
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,260
cycles

1356
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:48,480
um light cycles I think lots of things

1357
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,599
are turned on by the plant rather than

1358
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,579
off when light is on and that's because

1359
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:55,200
light is driving water transport and

1360
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:58,140
nutrient uptake and it's also driving

1361
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,299
photosynthesis so I think that too much

1362
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:02,098
dark is as bad as too much light light

1363
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,839
is if that makes sense

1364
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:05,338
like you're seeing the growth and the

1365
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:08,058
yield increase because the plant is

1366
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:11,338
doing a lot of stuff during that time

1367
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:13,200
and there is a circadian clock in Plants

1368
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:15,659
where there are different things that

1369
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,759
happen in the daytime and in the night

1370
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:19,618
time and they actually are different for

1371
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,480
the root part and the shoot part so they

1372
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:23,940
actually operate on different clocks but

1373
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,199
they do talk to each other so

1374
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,460
um I guess where I'm going with this is

1375
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,399
is that

1376
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,139
there is a circadian rhythm but we don't

1377
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,480
know enough about it to be able to say

1378
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:34,338
that that having light on the top of the

1379
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,740
plant

1380
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:41,039
is going to affect the roots in the way

1381
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:42,358
that I think this debate kind of goes

1382
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,039
um because if you think about it the

1383
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:45,539
roots are always in the dark they're

1384
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:46,800
never in the light they're not like

1385
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,900
there might be a small amount of light

1386
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,539
that makes it to the to the root but not

1387
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,940
enough that it should matter but they

1388
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:54,599
can still sense it a little bit

1389
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,679
um

1390
00:51:54,599 --> 00:52:01,980
man that is that is a very so but but

1391
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:03,960
yeah it is and and so when if if the

1392
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,760
maybe I'm thinking too top down about

1393
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,818
this because even though the light

1394
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:13,020
doesn't specifically reach their Roots

1395
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:15,779
right during the light mode the plant

1396
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:18,539
I'm I'm I think of it as the plant is

1397
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,760
giving commands through the roots and so

1398
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:24,179
even though the roots aren't

1399
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,579
um lit up the roots are responding to

1400
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:27,679
needs and commands from a plant that is

1401
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:30,420
actively

1402
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,639
photosynthesizing and then then in the

1403
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,619
dark cycle those those commands and

1404
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,838
needs of the photosynthesis are no

1405
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:40,200
longer taking place and so I imagine

1406
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:43,318
that the the roles and the tasks of of

1407
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,858
the root zone change when the plant is

1408
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:48,838
is is changing modes from

1409
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:50,578
photosynthesizing to you know the the

1410
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:52,219
processing of nutrients that it does

1411
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:55,079
during the dark

1412
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:57,598
exactly I think that's and I think the

1413
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:59,818
key word there is change because if they

1414
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,338
take up a bunch of nutrients during the

1415
00:52:59,818 --> 00:53:03,480
the daytime then a lot of those exudates

1416
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:06,179
that are helping with nutrient

1417
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,740
acquisition should be active like

1418
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:09,299
they're they're actively like you know

1419
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:10,739
fishing out the different components

1420
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,318
that it needs and putting it into the

1421
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:15,000
plant so the plant can continue to grow

1422
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:17,699
and those would change if the light is

1423
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,960
gone and they do have like we even know

1424
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:21,419
from like but you know those green

1425
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,440
potatoes like Roots themselves can sense

1426
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,720
light

1427
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,119
um both outside like sources of light

1428
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,799
but also the inside sources that we were

1429
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,599
just talking about like the light like

1430
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,059
the light that the plant above is

1431
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:34,680
sensing is also like notified they

1432
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:36,059
notify the roots that they need stuff

1433
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:38,639
right

1434
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:42,059
um I think this is I think this next

1435
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,739
question is is is the is the seal the

1436
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:44,760
deal question that I've been looking for

1437
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:48,838
so

1438
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,940
so if the if the root zone is doing

1439
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:53,960
different tasks

1440
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:57,240
when the plant is experiencing light

1441
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,220
because the plant is asking for things

1442
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,019
involved with you know photosynthesis

1443
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:04,259
production during the day those types of

1444
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:08,280
tasks and then and then when the light

1445
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:11,579
is gone the root zone changes to

1446
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:14,099
different sets of tasks

1447
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:16,980
that would seem to suggest to me that it

1448
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:19,980
needs a dark period so those dark period

1449
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:22,139
tasks can happen so maybe maybe I'm

1450
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,240
right but for the wrong reason for for a

1451
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:26,940
reason I didn't realize I thought that

1452
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:29,759
during the dark the exudates would stop

1453
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:33,179
and maybe that's not it because exudates

1454
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,480
happen around the clock maybe it's that

1455
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:39,239
the exudate and signaling that happens

1456
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,539
when the plant above is experiencing

1457
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:45,179
dark those differentiated tasks need to

1458
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:48,420
have an opportunity to happen too to

1459
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:51,118
have a thriving plan yeah yeah I think

1460
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,099
that could be a reasonable way to go

1461
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,740
about it I think that there's also two

1462
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:58,619
things I guess there is dark reactions

1463
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:00,959
and they're like evening onset

1464
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:03,300
um types of of things that change in the

1465
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,559
plant that are responding to a lessening

1466
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,660
of light at least when we're not talking

1467
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,160
about like growing light when we have

1468
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:09,779
actually like changes in light over the

1469
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:11,399
daytime as well

1470
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,660
um you know you're plant on the balcony

1471
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,700
or whatever

1472
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:17,098
um but there's also light independent

1473
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:19,318
reactions that tend to happen kind of

1474
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:21,900
at any time and what I mean by that is

1475
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:23,338
like photosynthesis is light driven like

1476
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,980
you absolutely have to have light for

1477
00:55:23,338 --> 00:55:27,838
that whole series of of chemistry

1478
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,480
reactions to happen

1479
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,338
um whereas the like other types of

1480
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,619
reactions don't need light like that so

1481
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:37,139
they might be happening 24 7. what I

1482
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:41,099
really think for my own personal opinion

1483
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:43,920
definitely an opinion um is that uh a

1484
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:47,280
little bit of Darkness helps because one

1485
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,380
thing that light is is a stressor it

1486
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,839
creates all these like Fast happening

1487
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,940
reactions it's quite powerful it can

1488
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,318
make really reactive molecules that if

1489
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,000
they're present in too much they can

1490
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:58,679
damage the plant

1491
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,960
um and those kind of things so I think

1492
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:03,960
having 24 hours of light constantly

1493
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,579
would yeah maybe mean that you don't

1494
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,079
have the down time that you need to take

1495
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:09,480
care of any kind of damage that's coming

1496
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:12,359
from light and that kind of stuff so for

1497
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,280
I guess my my weigh-in on this would be

1498
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:16,078
like a little bit of dark is helpful I

1499
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,420
think does that make sense yeah it does

1500
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,720
and I'm grateful to hear it

1501
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,980
um so um this idea that there can be too

1502
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:25,259
much light

1503
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:28,019
um is is interesting because you know

1504
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:29,220
most of us or folks who grow indoors

1505
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:31,079
anyway

1506
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,000
um you know while I've been historically

1507
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,280
an outdoor grower I've been I've been

1508
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,280
dabbling in indoor just to learn new

1509
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,559
stuff and

1510
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,180
most of the time

1511
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:45,019
cultivators are looking to blast the

1512
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:48,379
plants with as much light as is possible

1513
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:51,239
without bleaching or burning the plant

1514
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:56,280
and what I'm hearing from you is that

1515
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:58,139
there really is a a top end of how much

1516
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,280
light we necessarily want to give the

1517
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:00,900
plant

1518
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,819
um because there is there is too much

1519
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,358
there's a there's a top level

1520
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:08,279
yes there is um I think especially

1521
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,500
especially most of my experiences is

1522
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,700
growing inside and I think there's

1523
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,838
different things to think about because

1524
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:14,578
you can definitely have too much light

1525
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:16,799
inside but it's not like an overall

1526
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:18,359
amount of light there's all these focal

1527
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,920
lengths that come with bulbs and it kind

1528
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:22,078
of it's like shining a laser you know

1529
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,000
the magnifying glass on the you know

1530
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,680
something flammable and in the sun kind

1531
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,480
of thing like it focuses all the light

1532
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,219
from the bulb to a single point and if

1533
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,260
you're growing in that point it's really

1534
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:33,838
strong but like just for that little

1535
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:36,240
area and that's too much light but

1536
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,639
there's so much sun out there I don't

1537
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,078
think any indoor bulb at this point has

1538
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,299
ever gotten to the point where it can

1539
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,280
compete with the sun um it's just too

1540
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,079
dim the Spectrum isn't strong enough and

1541
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,800
a lot of the damaging wavelengths that

1542
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:51,960
we think of with light like UV b or c

1543
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,180
are just not present in the same

1544
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,440
quantity unless it's like you know a UVC

1545
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,179
light or something like that does that

1546
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,858
make sense yeah another there's too much

1547
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:01,858
Point light and then there's too much

1548
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:04,199
General light yeah I was making an over

1549
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:06,598
generalization about the too much like

1550
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:08,879
as if it was all sunlight but that's

1551
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:11,640
that's true like all you know no matter

1552
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,900
what kind of bulb uh we are talking

1553
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:15,598
about

1554
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:18,119
um it is it is some degree Less Than

1555
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:21,300
Sunshine and so that's probably those

1556
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:24,119
those that gap between sunshine and

1557
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,579
whatever the personality of the bulb is

1558
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,519
that's probably where the hitch and the

1559
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:31,440
Giddy Up Is Right is is somewhere in

1560
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:34,679
what the bulb is lacking when compared

1561
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,298
to the Sun yeah so I think in indoors

1562
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,098
like most of the light stress that I've

1563
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:39,539
seen is like you turn the lights on

1564
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,619
right after you spray something on the

1565
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:42,058
planets and you get some like lens

1566
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,798
burning where the lights just kind of

1567
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:46,079
magnified and focused at a point so you

1568
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:47,818
get like little Point Burns outside you

1569
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,559
can definitely see a lot more types of

1570
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:51,420
light damage and stress because it's so

1571
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,798
bright right out and if it's hot too

1572
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,500
like the plant just has a really hard

1573
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:57,179
time managing that level of light in in

1574
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,699
that those poor little photosystems get

1575
00:58:57,179 --> 00:59:01,199
a little stressed

1576
00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:03,539
when when we talked on the phone the

1577
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:04,858
other day kind of preparing for this

1578
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:07,440
discussion

1579
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:09,179
um you used a term that I I really liked

1580
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,500
and I don't know if it's if it's it's a

1581
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,940
scientific term or if it's just

1582
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,679
something that you were using to

1583
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:16,139
describe to me because you you've you

1584
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:19,798
used such fantastic examples but you use

1585
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:21,838
this phrase a free living microbes and

1586
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:23,400
and I remember talking to you I remember

1587
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,679
like oh wow I never I never really

1588
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,858
thought about microbes that were in the

1589
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:30,539
soil but weren't really interacting with

1590
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:32,759
the plant would you just talk about

1591
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:35,699
pre-living microbes for a moment

1592
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,859
absolutely so essentially when we think

1593
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:40,019
about ecology and like what's happening

1594
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:41,880
in the in the soil there's we definitely

1595
00:59:40,019 --> 00:59:42,960
talk a lot about microbes that interact

1596
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,160
with the plant but there's a couple

1597
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,579
different levels they can do that

1598
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:50,179
there's symbiosis where they need each

1599
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:53,700
other and then there's kind of like

1600
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:55,858
opportunistic sort of interactions where

1601
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:58,858
they don't so when I talk about Free

1602
00:59:55,858 --> 01:00:00,659
Living microbes um we generally use that

1603
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:02,940
term to mean things that kind of that

1604
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:05,098
are just they're in the soil too they

1605
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,720
don't have to be next to a plant they

1606
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:08,579
don't like if you remove the plant they

1607
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:11,519
go on living they they do their thing

1608
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:13,200
and and they they it's not the same and

1609
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,119
if anything like maybe the plant needs

1610
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:16,618
them more than they need it if that

1611
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,140
makes sense but if they're free living

1612
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:20,160
they they can complete their entire life

1613
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:23,219
cycle

1614
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,739
um without a plant if that makes sense

1615
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:27,598
so so that also brings up an interesting

1616
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:29,879
question about the opposite so so you

1617
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,818
said oh there are some of these microbes

1618
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,260
that that wouldn't exist without the

1619
01:00:32,818 --> 01:00:36,358
plant

1620
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,339
um is is this one of the reasons why it

1621
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:39,659
is it is so helpful to the cannabis

1622
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:43,798
plant to have

1623
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:47,879
other companion plants around because uh

1624
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:50,519
these these other plants are are helping

1625
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,880
support these these uh Free Living

1626
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:55,798
microbes and it just makes the entire

1627
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,900
rhizosphere more complex and more

1628
01:00:55,798 --> 01:01:00,059
thriving and more abundant

1629
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,139
oh I'm sure that's true yeah because

1630
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:03,660
like

1631
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:07,019
cover plants for example essentially

1632
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:09,000
what they're trying to do is is improve

1633
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:11,940
the soil life and that happens either

1634
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,400
through like providing a matrix like all

1635
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:16,019
those roots provide basically housing in

1636
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,000
a lot of ways like a little scaffold for

1637
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:19,139
different things to live on and in and

1638
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,059
under

1639
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:23,460
um but it also might help with for

1640
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:25,619
example maintaining humidity longer

1641
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,420
um so that if there's microbes in the

1642
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:29,700
soil that prefer to be wet all the time

1643
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,798
and they don't like drying out then you

1644
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:33,239
might have that layer is is happier

1645
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:34,980
because there's a plant there keeping

1646
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:36,179
the moisture locked in

1647
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,500
um maybe they don't like a lot of light

1648
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:39,000
and they're kind of shading the surface

1649
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,039
of the soil a little bit so maybe the

1650
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,420
fungus can get a little bit more close

1651
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:43,980
to the surface or something like that

1652
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,298
like I'm sure there's dozens of

1653
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,460
different things that a companion plant

1654
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:50,519
and we also plant like I personally

1655
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:53,338
plant a clover because it tends to also

1656
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:55,500
it has an interesting relationship with

1657
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:57,900
bacteria that actually lets it take on

1658
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,699
and fix more nitrogen than a lot of

1659
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,798
other plants do but it also brings the

1660
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:04,318
benefit of having that nitrogen fixing

1661
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:06,838
relationship with these bacteria that

1662
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:08,639
also benefit plants around it so the the

1663
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:10,199
cannabis plant itself doesn't do this

1664
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,298
but the fact that there's a plant near

1665
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:15,058
it that does improves the Nutri

1666
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:16,920
nutrients in the soil one of my favorite

1667
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,900
reasons and and the first reason I

1668
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,240
started companion planting

1669
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:24,599
um uh for my cannabis is I had it

1670
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:27,239
earlier in in my cultivation history I

1671
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:30,599
had a tendency to water incorrectly I

1672
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:33,659
was doing uh too much not often enough

1673
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:36,980
so I needed to water less more often but

1674
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:40,558
less and I had a tendency to get

1675
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:41,639
hydrophobic soil and and for folks who

1676
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,660
aren't familiar with that that means

1677
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:47,098
that the the top of your soil container

1678
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:49,920
gets kind of hard and then when you go

1679
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:52,380
and you you hand water the water just

1680
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:55,559
kind of slides off and and goes down the

1681
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:57,119
side instead of actually soaking into

1682
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:00,599
the soil and this happened to me all the

1683
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,760
time and I eventually learned during the

1684
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:07,380
shaping fire water and watering episode

1685
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:09,780
that if you use a a companion plant or

1686
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:13,079
in this case what we would consider a a

1687
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:15,900
cover crop with that has lots of roots

1688
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:17,940
say for example a clover or or you know

1689
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:21,720
some types of grasses

1690
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:24,480
um they not only can provide like the

1691
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:26,759
the the the the the canopy if you will

1692
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,880
to create this little moisture Vapor

1693
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,680
area between the tops of its leaves and

1694
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:35,519
the soil so the soil just generally

1695
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:37,259
stays more moist but also I was going

1696
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,960
for the fact that all these roots that

1697
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:42,420
go down in the soil all are providing

1698
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:46,199
like small Tunnels for the water to

1699
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:49,019
actually go into the soil itself and you

1700
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:51,118
know I actually solved my poor watering

1701
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:54,900
just by adding

1702
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:56,818
um a a multiple root

1703
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,139
uh planned and then that that problem

1704
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:00,659
just went away

1705
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:02,098
yep that's and and the other wonderful

1706
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:04,139
thing that you're doing is you're also

1707
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:07,079
introducing different types of exudates

1708
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:09,000
which improves your your soil life

1709
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:11,818
um so then you're just getting it's just

1710
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,519
more all the way around uh so so are

1711
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:17,219
there are we aware of any

1712
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:19,679
um you know either either companion

1713
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:21,118
plants in in cannabis of course we use

1714
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,460
these we use the idea of companion

1715
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,079
plants to often be the idea of like a

1716
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,720
bigger plant that's we're planting

1717
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:30,119
nearby like a you know like a like a

1718
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:31,980
cabbage or potatoes underneath it or

1719
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:34,740
whatever and then and then we kind of

1720
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:37,199
use the term cover crop even though we

1721
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:39,298
most of us in cannabis use that term not

1722
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:40,139
how it's traditionally used to talk

1723
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:43,739
about

1724
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:44,940
um lower plants that there's a lot of

1725
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:46,979
them

1726
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:48,960
um I'm kind of backing into this

1727
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,940
question but what I want to ask you is

1728
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,699
um are there plants that you are aware

1729
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:57,358
of that share

1730
01:04:53,699 --> 01:05:00,058
um exudate flavors complementary exudate

1731
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:02,400
flavors with cannabis plants that we

1732
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:04,980
should grow about can around our

1733
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,760
cannabis plants simply because they

1734
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:11,159
increase the vibrancy of the kinds of

1735
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:14,160
nutrition our cannabis plant is going to

1736
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:17,219
want thus suggesting oh you should grow

1737
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:19,679
these plants because it too will attract

1738
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:21,419
the kinds of nutrition and and make it

1739
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:22,558
more buffet style for your cannabis

1740
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:25,400
plant

1741
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,400
oh I think

1742
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:35,818
scientific realm like even just to

1743
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:37,379
identify exudates is super challenging

1744
01:05:35,818 --> 01:05:39,179
because you can't you can't even grow

1745
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,640
them in soil to be able to collect them

1746
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:43,858
so all of my experiments for example are

1747
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:45,960
done in a fogponic setup that I made um

1748
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:47,279
so that I can actually access the roots

1749
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,960
without the soil because of course

1750
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,960
otherwise you capture all the eggs dates

1751
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,000
from all the bacteria too

1752
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,639
so I don't think that we could get that

1753
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,380
that specific but I do know that they've

1754
01:05:56,639 --> 01:05:59,338
been doing a lot of interesting research

1755
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,980
with

1756
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:04,199
um with crops and companion plants and

1757
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,219
crops and the running theme there is

1758
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:08,818
usually

1759
01:06:05,219 --> 01:06:11,519
um something that fixes nitrogen really

1760
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:13,380
helps because it brings in not only the

1761
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:15,298
the nitrogen fixing aspect which is

1762
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,380
usually the limiting factor in plant

1763
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:18,599
growth

1764
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:20,640
um but it also brings all of its its

1765
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,380
symbiotic bacteria with it

1766
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:25,318
but I think as long as you as long as

1767
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:27,440
you have a cover crop as as we were just

1768
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:32,038
talking about that's improving your soil

1769
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,539
texture or soil Health in general I

1770
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:36,720
think that you're good and so for me

1771
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:39,380
like the the anecdotal answer would be

1772
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:42,239
something like we plant

1773
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:45,318
Clover partly for the nitrogen fixing

1774
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:48,118
but we also plant things like basil or

1775
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:50,579
marigolds that can act like trap plants

1776
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:52,858
to kind of give us a sense of of whether

1777
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:54,059
or not we have test things to worry

1778
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:55,380
about

1779
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:57,298
um and that kind of thing or anything

1780
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,160
that helps like pollinators come in and

1781
01:06:57,298 --> 01:07:01,199
that kind of thing because that usually

1782
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:03,000
I don't know more life is better usually

1783
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:06,000
does that make sense yeah I follow that

1784
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,679
you know this the example that you gave

1785
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,480
um I had not really considered how

1786
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:11,399
difficult your research must be because

1787
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:14,039
I figured there was just some way for

1788
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,798
you to you know grab the exudates you

1789
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:18,960
know scrape them off scrape pull up a

1790
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:20,940
plant and scrape some off the The Roots

1791
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,440
You know that were in soil but but but

1792
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,119
that's right there's all everybody else

1793
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,740
who's in there too especially the

1794
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:28,260
bacteria they're all laying out exudates

1795
01:07:25,739 --> 01:07:31,019
too and so it's just like a mess and you

1796
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:34,680
can't tease them out and so you're using

1797
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:38,159
this fogponic system so the so the roots

1798
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:41,098
are just dangling and there's not soil

1799
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:43,318
life interacting with it so in an odd

1800
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:45,900
way you're you're like an exudate

1801
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:47,519
Rancher like you've got to you've gotta

1802
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,400
you've got to do this [ __ ] pond so that

1803
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:52,500
you can collect them first yep that's

1804
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,019
correct yeah we have a couple other ways

1805
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,400
but they're all like really they're all

1806
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:58,739
complicated

1807
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,358
um you can do sterile culture like um

1808
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:02,459
tissue culture

1809
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:03,900
um but then the necessity of that is you

1810
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:05,579
have to have a plant that can you can

1811
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:08,099
grow in tissue culture and if I was

1812
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:10,079
working with with um cannabis I think it

1813
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:12,180
would be easier because it it does grow

1814
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,680
in tissue culture uh which would be nice

1815
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:16,619
and then you can just sample the media

1816
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:18,960
and and extract the meat that exudates

1817
01:08:16,619 --> 01:08:20,579
from the media but there's lots and lots

1818
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,980
of plants out there that don't like to

1819
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:26,039
culture that won't grow in a little tiny

1820
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:29,278
box or or trees some which I'm working

1821
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:31,619
with right now that that just defy defy

1822
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:33,359
hydroponics in general so yeah you got

1823
01:08:31,619 --> 01:08:36,500
to get clever about it for sure and it

1824
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,500
is very much like ranching

1825
01:08:36,539 --> 01:08:40,500
right on all right cool

1826
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,719
um so let's go ahead and take our second

1827
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,859
break uh during the third set stick with

01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,939
us because we're going to be talking

1829
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:47,640
about

1830
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:50,338
um uh salt-based nutrients and exudates

1831
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:53,819
hydroponics and exudates and unsaltured

1832

01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:45,600
listening to shapingfire and I am your

1965
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:48,060
host shangelos and my guest today is

1966
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,120
plant biologist Sarah Lane

1967
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:54,420
so let's talk about a couple of the

1968
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:57,300
applications of of exudates

1969
01:13:54,420 --> 01:14:00,119
um with with common situations that we

1970
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,619
deal with as cannabis cultivators and um

1971
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:04,439
the first one I want to talk about with

1972
01:14:01,619 --> 01:14:06,960
you Sarah is is salt-based nutrients so

1973
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:08,939
you know on this show we we generally

1974
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,279
not generally we very specifically

1975
01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:14,519
support living soil

1976
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:18,238
um you know a biomimicry of of you know

1977
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:21,179
the natural world and um are not big

1978
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:23,639
fans of salt-based nutrients generally

1979
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:25,560
but you know I always know I need to

1980
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,000
give them a fair shake when it comes to

1981
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,380
science because that's that's really

1982
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,439
what we're listening to is the science

1983
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:34,560
not my own biases so

1984
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:37,259
um I'm curious to know what kind of a

1985
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:41,280
relationship that that using you know

1986
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:42,539
bottled salt-based nutrients has on the

1987
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,399
exudates

1988
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:47,100
um and then their ability to communicate

1989
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:49,019
and the and the community I guess

1990
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,300
I think that's

1991
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:53,340
um I think most of the time when we're

1992
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,380
talking salt based nutrients like it

1993
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:57,600
doesn't really go very well in living

1994
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:59,039
soil which is my preferred method of

1995
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,199
growing too so

1996
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:03,060
um we're on the same page there I think

1997
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:05,579
um with salt-based nutrients there's

1998
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:07,320
sort of two things that happen one is um

1999
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:09,719
like we were talking about earlier it

2000
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:11,219
can really disrupt the signaling

2001
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:13,500
um or at least that's my my theory

2002
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:15,359
because you're introducing a huge amount

2003
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:17,219
of nutrients to the plant

2004
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:18,839
um that it would have been making all

2005
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:20,579
these wonderful little eggs dates to try

2006
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,560
and tease out from as we were saying

2007
01:15:20,579 --> 01:15:25,319
earlier microbes or or the soil itself

2008
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,179
and you're just flooding it so I think

2009
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:30,899
that it would pretty significantly

2010
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:32,520
disrupt the eggs date type at least of

2011
01:15:30,899 --> 01:15:33,719
what's being produced

2012
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,120
um the other thing it does is it really

2013
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:38,399
kind of messes around with the chemistry

2014
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:40,500
of the soil so um like if you're only

2015
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,698
feeding salt-based nutrients you end up

2016
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,380
with salt buildup and stuff like that

2017
01:15:41,698 --> 01:15:45,960
and that can happen in a living soil

2018
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:48,060
system too and usually those conditions

2019
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,340
aren't really conducive to of microbial

2020
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:53,520
life or root health and you end up just

2021
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:56,279
getting a lot of compounding problems

2022
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,679
um so so it's it's less about

2023
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:01,439
um the salt-based nutrients somehow

2024
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,239
masking the the chemical signatures or

2025
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:06,539
anything that it's just that

2026
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:09,238
um the the people who are normally uh

2027
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:11,579
giving off the exudates and receiving

2028
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:12,658
the exudates they're generally just not

2029
01:16:11,579 --> 01:16:14,939
there

2030
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:17,158
yeah like I think I think the plant if

2031
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:18,419
if it's got all the nutrients it needs

2032
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:20,879
it's going to put its resources

2033
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,859
elsewhere and um and I think if you're

2034
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,560
compromising the soil life at all then a

2035
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:26,819
lot of that signaling would would be as

2036
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,920
as we were saying earlier probably

2037
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:30,359
dampened would be my guess dampen that's

2038
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,880
a good word yeah

2039
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:34,859
um you know a lot of the um you know a

2040
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,460
lot of people are playing with soilless

2041
01:16:34,859 --> 01:16:41,219
mediums that are increasingly more and

2042
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:43,198
more uh uh you know cocoa based Coco

2043
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:45,420
coir to the point that some folks are

2044
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:47,339
just like like they don't have soil in

2045
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:49,980
their substrate right it's it's not

2046
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:53,699
really hydroponic it's but it's just uh

2047
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:56,459
it's it's cocoa and it's nutrients and

2048
01:16:53,698 --> 01:17:00,238
um I'm curious if these these types of

2049
01:16:56,460 --> 01:17:04,140
cocoa and soilless mediums have any

2050
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:06,718
impact on the on the signaling capacity

2051
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:09,659
of these exudates

2052
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:12,359
um I guess what I'm asking is is the is

2053
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:16,679
the soil component

2054
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:19,939
um key to the ability of the exudates to

2055
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:19,940
be able to do their job

2056
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:25,799
the previous question was there are

2057
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:28,198
circumstances so I think the real

2058
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,300
problem I have with sulfate nutrients is

2059
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:32,279
if it's in combination with living soil

2060
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,619
because they're in living soil you're

2061
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:36,719
relying on this microbial life to help

2062
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:39,539
provide nutrients and it just gets all

2063
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,460
out of whack but like for example in my

2064
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:43,439
research I have to use salt-based

2065
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:46,319
nutrients because I need a very defined

2066
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:48,238
set of nutrients that um to be able to

2067
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:50,340
repeat my experiments

2068
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:52,079
um and in that case with the fog ponics

2069
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:53,640
and that kind of thing it's it's not

2070
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:55,019
necessarily like the exudates are going

2071
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,579
away it's just that the types of

2072
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,860
exudates that I'm looking at are

2073
01:17:56,579 --> 01:18:00,479
nutrient based and not microbial based

2074
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:02,939
so I don't notice a difference and in

2075
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,439
that case I think in cocoa or peat or

2076
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:06,899
something like that as long as you're

2077
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:10,198
not relying on the bacteria that or or

2078
01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:12,059
fungus that are present to assist you in

2079
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:14,099
the nutrients it wouldn't make as much

2080
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:16,560
of a difference I I think it would

2081
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:18,120
change the expression of the exudates

2082
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,500
though like the types of exudates that

2083
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:20,579
are produced would be different does

2084
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,140
that make sense yeah because you're

2085
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:24,539
still going to be producing them and

2086
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:27,000
it's really interesting for you as a

2087
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:30,439
living soil cultivator at home but

2088
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:34,260
needing to use salts in the lab

2089
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:36,859
it puts you in a unique position to be

2090
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:40,020
you know comparing and contrasting them

2091
01:18:36,859 --> 01:18:44,219
let's talk about like if if you're using

2092
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:47,219
a if you're using salt fertilizers in a

2093
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:50,698
you know in a soilless medium like cocoa

2094
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:52,500
and you just said that if you were in

2095
01:18:50,698 --> 01:18:54,658
that kind of environment it wouldn't

2096
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:56,880
that the exudates wouldn't be there it

2097
01:18:54,658 --> 01:18:58,979
would be that there would be nutrition

2098
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,840
based exudates

2099
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:03,119
um you would just be changing the

2100
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:07,079
variety of exudates that are there that

2101
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:10,559
are being expressed my question would be

2102
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:13,319
would that impact how the plant

2103
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,140
expresses itself it seemed to me that if

2104
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:18,840
we are are changing the exudates that

2105
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:21,060
are you know part of the cacophony in

2106
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,520
the soil that we're going to get you

2107
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:26,280
know uh different colors on the plant

2108
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,140
different terpene profile maybe a

2109
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:29,279
difference in quality of thriving it

2110
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,679
seems like the plant would Express

2111
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,300
itself at the top level is there is

2112
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,699
there any weight to that

2113
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:38,340
yeah I think so I think like if we were

2114
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:40,559
to go back to our bizarre metaphor from

2115
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:42,119
earlier when you when you feed

2116
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,100
salt-based nutrients it's kind of like

2117
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:45,359
putting in a really big box store or

2118
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,460
something like that it really changes

2119
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:51,000
the flavor of what's happening in that

2120
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:53,100
location and I think that changes the

2121
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,198
personality of of the soil and I think

2122
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:57,539
like to borrow a I don't know

2123
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:59,339
personifying my soil now but you know

2124
01:19:57,539 --> 01:20:00,779
like the like the the conversations that

2125
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:02,520
are happening

2126
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:05,039
um and the types of players that are

2127
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:06,719
there changes pretty significantly and I

2128
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:09,779
don't doubt that that would also change

2129
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:12,179
the the plant itself the plant is very

2130
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:13,800
flexible it's going to do its best to

2131
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:15,960
grow and to thrive in whatever

2132
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,940
circumstances that you put it in but

2133
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:21,480
when you change those circumstances it's

2134
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:23,158
going to change itself to fit and so um

2135
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:25,198
and and I know lots of people that

2136
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:27,719
anecdotally say that terpenes are

2137
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,158
different and and like cannabinoid

2138
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,899
profiles are different when you grow in

2139
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:32,279
living soil and stuff like that whereas

2140
01:20:30,899 --> 01:20:34,500
like when you're feeding salt based

2141
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:36,179
maybe you're going for weight and the

2142
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,560
plant is forced into putting more weight

2143
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:39,539
on because it's got all those extra

2144
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,620
nutrients and maybe it makes less and I

2145
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:42,359
don't know that for sure because I

2146
01:20:40,619 --> 01:20:43,939
haven't studied it myself but I think

2147
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:47,158
that anecdotally I've seen that happen

2148
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:48,779
right on so so even even though you

2149
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:52,519
haven't seen the science for it it makes

2150
01:20:48,779 --> 01:20:52,519
it makes intuitive sense if

2151
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,420
it's complex it's it's kind of a fun way

2152
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,738
to think about ecology too in in a pot

2153
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,719
you know

2154
01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:07,979
um but it the plant is really able to

2155
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,600
pick and choose a little better than

2156
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:11,279
kind of I don't know for speeding at

2157
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,620
Salt if that makes sense yeah for sure

2158
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:16,439
and we talk a lot on on shaping fire

2159
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:19,319
about the importance of you know a a

2160
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:22,259
complex and thriving rhizosphere to have

2161
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:25,019
a complex and thriving plant so that you

2162
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:27,360
have a complex and delightful terpene

2163
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:30,480
profile and and the more you're

2164
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:33,839
simplifying what is in

2165
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:37,139
um the pot say for example using a cocoa

2166
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:39,060
soilless medium and salt-based nutrients

2167
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,320
um I think the example you used was just

2168
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,000
putting them in a big box store so

2169
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:44,579
you're going to get big box Terps out of

2170
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,158
it and not necessarily the a full range

2171
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:48,658
perhaps yeah I think that's totally

2172
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:50,039
reasonable and again like this also ties

2173
01:21:48,658 --> 01:21:51,719
into carbon budget because when you're

2174
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:53,519
when you're forcing a plant to grow in a

2175
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:55,079
specific way you're also asking it to

2176
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,940
allocate all its resources in that

2177
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:59,519
direction too which generally means it

2178
01:21:56,939 --> 01:22:01,500
has less for other stuff which maybe is

2179
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,580
stuff that we want like terpenes right

2180
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,520
on

2181
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:08,279
um uh let's talk a little bit about

2182
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,860
um I think what I think I can probably

2183
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:12,779
group Hydroponics and fog ponics

2184
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:14,339
together but if not tease them back

2185
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:17,340
apart for me

2186
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:19,319
um I'm curious because uh you know we've

2187
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:22,940
we've talked significantly on this show

2188
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:27,960
about the soil food web and then

2189
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:30,599
somewhat about the water food web and a

2190
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:33,179
Hydroponics solution and a I'm assuming

2191
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:35,940
a fog solution we're talking about the

2192
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:39,359
water food web and

2193
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:42,960
um I'm wondering if there

2194
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:45,658
the quality and number and variety of

2195
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:48,000
the exudates that are in those systems

2196
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:50,639
sound like there's going to be less

2197
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,579
since you initiated this by saying oh I

2198
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,980
use I use a fog ponics because we're

2199
01:22:53,579 --> 01:22:57,960
trying to

2200
01:22:54,979 --> 01:22:59,459
Ranch these particular exudates and in

2201
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,039
soil there's just too many so I'm

2202
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:04,560
assuming that in Hydroponics and in in

2203
01:23:02,039 --> 01:23:06,840
in fog ponics that there are going to be

2204
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:10,199
less exudates based on what you had said

2205
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:13,380
earlier and so with Hydroponics with

2206
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:15,779
this same idea

2207
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:18,359
um crossover from the soilless mediums

2208
01:23:15,779 --> 01:23:21,059
that that there may be reasons you want

2209
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:23,698
to use Hydroponics but in the end there

2210
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:26,580
are going to be less varieties of

2211
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:29,219
exudates and you know signaling

2212
01:23:26,579 --> 01:23:31,679
conversation taking uh uh take you know

2213
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:34,079
going on and nutrition so you would run

2214
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,940
into the same problem with hydroponic

2215
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:39,439
systems that you're

2216
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:39,439
not aggressively

2217
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:45,000
um supplementing I guess so yeah yeah I

2218
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:46,619
think that's fair I mean for me the the

2219
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,719
difference between fog ponics and

2220
01:23:46,619 --> 01:23:50,399
hydroponics just quickly would be just

2221
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,679
like the um

2222
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:56,519
I don't know dryness if that makes sense

2223
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:58,679
because uh the fog ponics is even though

2224
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,179
it's nutrients it's very dry like the

2225
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:02,460
roots aren't sitting in water they're

2226
01:24:00,179 --> 01:24:04,380
not um they're not like soggy so

2227
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:05,579
anything that's really intolerant of

2228
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:07,380
flooding

2229
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:09,539
um I've been able to grow more

2230
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:10,920
successfully in thought ponics as

2231
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:12,779
opposed to Hydroponics where a lot of

2232
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,199
Hydroponics your plants are really

2233
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:18,238
sitting in water or constantly sprayed

2234
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:19,619
by water or a lot of stuff like that but

2235
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:21,178
it's a really subtle difference I think

2236
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:23,279
because the nutrient solution I use for

2237
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:27,000
both um is the same

2238
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:28,619
um so as far as like it Compares pretty

2239
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,380
well to soilless I think the biggest

2240
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:33,119
difference at least for me wouldn't

2241
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:35,579
necessarily be in exudates it would be

2242
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:38,579
more in like root architecture because

2243
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:40,800
um the plants in a in a like peat or

2244
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:43,260
cocoa it's it's more like soil for like

2245
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,840
how they can grow but on the exudate

2246
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:48,239
level I think that the same is probably

2247
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,860
true there's going to be a more defined

2248
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:52,198
set of exudates they're probably coming

2249
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:54,238
mostly from the plant and you you miss

2250
01:24:52,198 --> 01:24:56,460
out on some of those interactions with

2251
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:58,139
bacteria and fungus and stuff like that

2252
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,640
and there's still maybe some that can

2253
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:01,140
grow in those kind of conditions but a

2254
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,480
lot less than would be growing in soil

2255
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:05,579
at least as far as I can tell right on

2256
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:07,619
um I also want to add a little something

2257
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:09,420
for all my Hydroponics people who are

2258
01:25:07,619 --> 01:25:12,179
listening who are now like pissed at me

2259
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:13,980
because I'm I'm I'm underselling their

2260
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:16,920
craft I want to be clear that I do

2261
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:18,899
understand that that some Hydroponics

2262
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,520
um there's a lot of varieties of

2263
01:25:18,899 --> 01:25:23,579
Hydroponics I mean we had we did a

2264
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:26,940
really great soil food web show a couple

2265
01:25:23,579 --> 01:25:29,158
years ago with Steve Reisner and and you

2266
01:25:26,939 --> 01:25:33,119
know he does that you know first of all

2267
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:35,519
he is heavy into uh bringing in uh you

2268
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,899
know water with uh with malm and fish

2269
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,320
poop in it so there's a lot of

2270
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:41,939
complexity there and um and and he was

2271
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:44,579
describing you know the the great

2272
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:46,738
flowers that he pulls from his setup but

2273
01:25:44,579 --> 01:25:48,300
but he also has some soil in the mix

2274
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,579
right so he's he's like flooding and

2275
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:52,619
draining the soil and he's got the fish

2276
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:54,779
pooping so he's making this like

2277
01:25:52,619 --> 01:25:56,939
incredibly biologically active

2278
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:59,819
environment that makes you know flowers

2279
01:25:56,939 --> 01:26:02,219
with terpene profiles that um that he

2280
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:04,439
says we we don't even get in in a

2281
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:06,600
straight soil medium so I want to be

2282
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:09,059
clear when when I'm talking about the

2283
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:11,219
limitations of Hydroponics I'm talking

2284
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:13,320
about you know the kinds of stuff that

2285
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:15,060
people are generally either doing you

2286
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:18,658
know in their in you know in the extra

2287
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:21,719
room in their house or at you know wild

2288
01:26:18,658 --> 01:26:23,579
scale of corporate cannabis I absolutely

2289
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:26,579
appreciate the fact that there are

2290
01:26:23,579 --> 01:26:28,800
really tasty ways to do complex Plex

2291
01:26:26,579 --> 01:26:30,179
hydroponic so

2292
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,100
makes sense and I would like to add

2293
01:26:30,179 --> 01:26:33,840
there that like each of these growing

2294
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,460
methods has its place and the plant will

2295
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,980
grow regardless

2296
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:40,198
um and so I I know I've had some really

2297
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:42,000
good hydroponic weed before I know that

2298
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:43,738
I've had some really good living soil

2299
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,179
weed like they they all have they all

2300
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:46,439
have their way of doing things and I

2301
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:48,539
also think that there's ways to make

2302
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:50,519
Hydroponics more accessible to bacterial

2303
01:26:48,539 --> 01:26:52,500
life and like you were just saying with

2304
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:54,900
a different terpene profile that you

2305
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:56,880
don't get with either of the other two

2306
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:58,259
and that just kind of goes to prove the

2307
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,719
point that what you're putting on your

2308
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:02,340
roots does change and and same with the

2309
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,560
type of life that you're growing changes

2310
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:05,880
what the plant is able to do and

2311
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,460
sometimes that's for the better

2312
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:10,260
depending on which method you're using

2313
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:11,698
so definitely like whatever you're

2314
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:13,619
growing your plant in is better than not

2315
01:27:11,698 --> 01:27:15,000
growing your plant at all yeah there you

2316
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:16,859
go and you know that's one of the

2317
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,960
challenges that we ran into

2318
01:27:16,859 --> 01:27:21,719
um during these like 24 hours of Lights

2319
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:24,179
debate people are like I grow a huge ass

2320
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:27,060
plant that was absolutely beautiful and

2321
01:27:24,179 --> 01:27:28,380
totally got me high and and and every

2322
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,300
all my friends bought it from me and

2323
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:31,679
that was great and they're all like why

2324
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:34,739
are you telling me that I shouldn't be

2325
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:36,539
using 24 hours and and and my response

2326
01:27:34,738 --> 01:27:38,519
is always it's it's not that I'm saying

2327
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:40,198
that you can't grow plants and that your

2328
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,600
plants are going to suck if you if you

2329
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:44,579
do you go 24 hours I'm saying that

2330
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,960
you're probably leaving some quality on

2331
01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:48,658
the table

2332
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:51,060
um by doing it 24 hours and your terpene

2333
01:27:48,658 --> 01:27:52,879
profile could be better and the plants

2334
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:57,480
could be better and you could be more

2335
01:27:52,880 --> 01:28:00,000
more pest resistant if you just uh gave

2336
01:27:57,479 --> 01:28:02,279
it four hours of of sleep or six hours

2337
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,279
of sleep it would be helpful

2338
01:28:02,279 --> 01:28:07,859
um but you know internet debates are

2339
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:11,460
rarely that nuanced you know oh it's so

2340
01:28:07,859 --> 01:28:12,839
true and I I do think that like even it

2341
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,460
doesn't really at the end of the day

2342
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:16,380
matter if you're growing a plant that

2343
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:18,119
suits your tastes like however you're

2344
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:19,739
doing it is great I mean unless you're

2345
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:21,000
dumping like illegal pesticides on it or

2346
01:28:19,738 --> 01:28:23,099
something like that maybe maybe don't do

2347
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,079
that but you know like I think at the

2348
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:26,579
end of the day everybody's gonna have a

2349
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:28,260
way of growing that works for them and

2350
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:30,179
there's absolutely these debates are all

2351
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,920
like try trying to tease out the the

2352
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:33,899
finer ways of growing and like the best

2353
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,399
way to grow and that's going to be very

2354
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:37,738
much personal preference at the end of

2355
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:39,299
the day and I personally prefer the

2356
01:28:37,738 --> 01:28:40,799
taste of living soil weed but I've had

2357
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:42,539
really good weed that's been grown in

2358
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,940
every other condition you can imagine so

2359
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:46,800
I'm you know yeah here as long as you're

2360
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:48,839
growing a plant it's fine yeah I'm with

2361
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,060
you there and and it also gets me when

2362
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:53,219
when people are demanding that you know

2363
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:55,440
their their recipe of how they grow is

2364
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:57,719
is the best and one and only and I'm

2365
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:59,339
like that's that that shouldn't even be

2366
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:01,619
coming out of a out of a cannabis

2367
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:03,900
cultivator's mouth you know it really

2368
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:06,300
depends on what your particular needs

2369
01:29:03,899 --> 01:29:08,638
are and your resources and your location

2370
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,199
and you know I would I would love to

2371
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,060
grow differently than I do but I also

2372
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:14,638
don't live in California you know no

2373
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:16,440
totally fair yeah which which pushes me

2374
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:18,359
towards things like short flowering

2375
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:20,158
thing and autoflowers right

2376
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:22,439
um you know if I lived in California I

2377
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:25,019
would probably still be focusing on my

2378
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:26,399
own cultivation on photos so all right

2379
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:27,719
so the next thing I want to talk about

2380
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:31,979
is

2381
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:34,198
um is unsolver molasses so it is it is a

2382
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:39,539
pretty common in

2383
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:42,479
um in living soil for for folks to

2384
01:29:39,539 --> 01:29:43,979
um think that they can make up for not

2385
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:45,359
giving

2386
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:49,500
I guess I'll call it like whole

2387
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:53,039
nutrition like whole amendments like um

2388
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:57,000
let's say like um like like fish meal

2389
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:59,460
and and crab shell and

2390
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,500
um maybe alfalfa meal all of these

2391
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,000
amendments that we love to use in living

2392
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:06,719
soil

2393
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,779
um to have an abundant variety of

2394
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:12,300
nutrients there for the uh the I guess

2395
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:15,359
the exudate processors to chew through

2396
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:17,100
and then give to the plant so and and so

2397
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:18,479
the exudates come back and then they

2398
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:21,840
feed the microbes and this is beautiful

2399
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:23,819
relationship and it is not uncommon for

2400
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,319
people to say well you know I don't I

2401
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:27,599
don't need to do all of that to take

2402
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:29,579
care of my microbes because

2403
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,639
I just I just feed the microbes with

2404
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:34,859
unsulfured molasses and and you know

2405
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:37,679
that that pains me because

2406
01:30:34,859 --> 01:30:41,099
um I I have a gut feeling that just

2407
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:44,719
pouring sugar into the soil

2408
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:47,760
um is not a great idea and and and

2409
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:52,560
molasses is kind of unidimensional

2410
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:54,659
whereas microbe life is so uh so vastly

2411
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:58,020
complex and I get where they're coming

2412
01:30:54,658 --> 01:31:01,859
from right because when we are brewing a

2413
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:05,639
compost tea we will often add a bit of

2414
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:08,099
unsulfured molasses to that so that the

2415
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:11,219
um the microbes have have something to

2416
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:12,539
eat so that we can incubate them and I

2417
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:15,359
have a whole bunch of them in a small

2418
01:31:12,539 --> 01:31:17,639
place that we can then pour onto our

2419
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,759
plants so so I get where they got the

2420
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:22,500
idea but I think that is a

2421
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:26,760
misapplication of the understanding of

2422
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:29,520
what effect molasses has on the microbe

2423
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:31,860
life in the rise those here so so as

2424
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,380
somebody who who has an intimate

2425
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:37,139
relationship with exudates what are your

2426
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:40,679
thoughts on and adding unsulfured

2427
01:31:37,139 --> 01:31:42,539
molasses directly into the substrate as

2428
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:43,859
part of some sort of nutritive root

2429
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:48,060
drench

2430
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:50,399
I am going to go back to the theme of

2431
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:52,380
the day which is it's complicated and it

2432
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:54,719
depends I think

2433
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,819
um I think that if you are trying to

2434
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,319
recover your soil life just with

2435
01:31:56,819 --> 01:31:59,939
molasses that it really depends on the

2436
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:02,099
health of the soil that you're adding it

2437
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:04,079
to because that molasses just like it

2438
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:05,940
does in compost tea is does have sugar

2439
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:08,219
in it I'm sure things will like to eat

2440
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:09,719
what's there and grow but that means

2441
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:11,520
that anything in your soil you're adding

2442
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:14,279
it to is going to grow too so if you've

2443
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,620
got some nasty you know anaerobic

2444
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:18,179
bacteria in in your soil already like

2445
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:19,920
that's going to love it as much as the

2446
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:21,060
next thing does

2447
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,739
um and the other thing is like a lot of

2448
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:24,840
the Amendments we add

2449
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:25,678
um provide different

2450
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,719
um

2451
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:29,279
I don't know different opportunities for

2452
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:31,920
different types of microbes to come in

2453
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:33,539
so if you're only feeding molasses and

2454
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,100
that's how you're getting your microbial

2455
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:36,840
life like it might get there eventually

2456
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:38,520
but it's also going to be the microbes

2457
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:41,219
that specifically like molasses and

2458
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:43,860
you'll miss out maybe on some of the the

2459
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:45,539
kelp or the crab meal type and again

2460
01:32:43,859 --> 01:32:48,420
this is all kind of conjecture because

2461
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:50,579
truthfully the science isn't there to to

2462
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:51,899
be able to specifically identify each

2463
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:53,100
different bacteria that come with each

2464
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:54,479
of these but

2465
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,679
um that's that's what my gut feeling

2466
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:57,839
would be

2467
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:59,639
um if you're already if your health of

2468
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,860
your soil is really good and you're

2469
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:03,480
already adding compost teas and things

2470
01:33:01,859 --> 01:33:05,698
like that if you're diluting a little

2471
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:07,678
bit of molasses in water I don't I don't

2472
01:33:05,698 --> 01:33:09,299
think it's it's harmful

2473
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:11,100
um but again like I do think that the

2474
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,900
biggest Factor on whether that's a good

2475
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,639
idea or bad is probably the health of

2476
01:33:12,899 --> 01:33:18,238
your soil to begin with does that make

2477
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:20,460
sense yeah it does so um you know is

2478
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:24,359
there anything that we can do to

2479
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:26,340
encourage healthy exudate creation by

2480
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:27,658
the cannabis plant I mean we've talked

2481
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:30,179
we've talked a bit about like just

2482
01:33:27,658 --> 01:33:32,839
generally keep your soil healthy got it

2483
01:33:30,179 --> 01:33:36,119
but is there anything that we can do

2484
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:40,440
like a uh is there is there any kind of

2485
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:44,279
uh uh a a a a a a fermented plant juice

2486
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:47,039
or a supplement or or in anything that

2487
01:33:44,279 --> 01:33:48,840
we could do to encourage exudate

2488
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:54,600
creation because they really do seem to

2489
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:56,039
be a um a baseline to a thriving plant

2490
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,320
where

2491
01:33:56,039 --> 01:34:01,380
um if if you've got poor exudate

2492
01:33:58,319 --> 01:34:04,559
activity everything that happens more

2493
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:09,900
complex than that is going to be limited

2494
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:12,199
by the the sad exudate system so is

2495
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:15,359
there anything that we can do that's

2496
01:34:12,198 --> 01:34:17,939
pro-exudate that that we should consider

2497
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:20,279
oh that is a good question

2498
01:34:17,939 --> 01:34:24,658
um I mean I think

2499
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:27,179
the best answer is probably no and yes

2500
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:28,859
um no there isn't a magical thing that

2501
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:30,840
as much as it would be nice to just like

2502
01:34:28,859 --> 01:34:32,698
promote root health and the healthiest

2503
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,960
Roots you've ever seen just like Sprout

2504
01:34:32,698 --> 01:34:36,059
out of the

2505
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:37,679
um out of the soil and you're good to go

2506
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:39,780
um because really it actually ends up

2507
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:41,880
being about root health

2508
01:34:39,779 --> 01:34:43,439
um and that's where the yes part comes

2509
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:46,500
in because you can support root health

2510
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:48,238
by um like the type like you were

2511
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,560
talking about earlier proper watering

2512
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:50,638
technique

2513
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,739
um where you're making sure the roots

2514
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:54,960
aren't like super dry and they're not

2515
01:34:52,738 --> 01:34:57,500
super wet or anything like that you can

2516
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:59,698
promote root health with soil texture

2517
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,840
you can add these compost teas and

2518
01:34:59,698 --> 01:35:03,059
things like that like we've been talking

2519
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:05,039
about to promote the type of microbes

2520
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:06,900
that you want to be there

2521
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,420
um you can give them lots of space to

2522
01:35:06,899 --> 01:35:11,339
grow obviously more Roots equals more

2523
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:12,960
exudates so if you have a nice big root

2524
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,819
ball I'm a big fan of big root balls

2525
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,439
though because it's my thing so

2526
01:35:14,819 --> 01:35:19,799
um that that's probably what I would say

2527
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:22,138
is like good good root health and so

2528
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,300
um yeah I think that's that but I mean

2529
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:25,980
again it's so hard to say how to get

2530
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:27,960
good root health and it's sort of trial

2531
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:29,698
and error So philosophically speaking

2532
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,920
these kind of conversations help too

2533
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:33,299
because you'll find people all over the

2534
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,980
place that have different ways of making

2535
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:36,480
sure they have healthy roots and maybe

2536
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:39,779
one of those ends up working for your

2537
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:41,638
particular strain or type of plant no

2538
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:44,279
surprise that you're a big fan of root

2539
01:35:41,639 --> 01:35:46,199
balls being up there in BC the land of

2540
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:48,380
Natasha Riz who's been on the show

2541
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:51,059
talking about root balls as well

2542
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:53,699
my Canadian friends all love the the

2543
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:56,039
love the Cannabis root ball and Roots

2544
01:35:53,698 --> 01:35:58,439
equals good plan totally it's so nice to

2545
01:35:56,039 --> 01:36:01,139
come to an end of an episode without

2546
01:35:58,439 --> 01:36:02,519
anything new we have to do you know

2547
01:36:01,139 --> 01:36:04,980
usually when we go through these

2548
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,840
episodes at the end there's like okay I

2549
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:08,399
need I need to learn about this and I

2550
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,020
need to start adding this and I need to

2551
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:12,539
learn how to start you know making this

2552
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:14,940
Korean natural farming prep but really

2553
01:36:12,539 --> 01:36:17,819
at the end of the story we've learned a

2554
01:36:14,939 --> 01:36:21,599
whole ton about exudates today so so a

2555
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:23,340
we stop repeating Bro Science and B we

2556
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,560
have like a more intimate relationship

2557
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:27,659
with an understanding of the biology of

2558
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,520
our plant but really if if you're

2559
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:32,158
already

2560
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:35,340
studying living soil and trying to have

2561
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:37,679
a healthy soil like the exodies will

2562
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:40,560
take care of themselves and it's it's so

2563
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:44,279
delightful to just be able to get new

2564
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:46,380
understanding without new tasks

2565
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:47,698
it's true root health is just you know

2566
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:49,440
what just keep doing what you're doing

2567
01:36:47,698 --> 01:36:52,259
and grow the healthiest plants that you

2568
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:53,879
can and uh and the plant is very good at

2569
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:55,500
taking care of itself so if you give it

2570
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:57,779
the opportunity to then you won't have

2571
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:59,880
to worry about it fabulous well Sarah

2572
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:02,219
thank you so much for sharing your time

2573
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:04,079
and and expertise with us today on

2574
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:06,600
shaping fire you know I mentioned this

2575
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:09,960
in the introduction to the show that um

2576
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:13,380
you know you really do have a a rare

2577
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:15,359
specialty and to find somebody who is

2578
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:18,659
you know doing this at the at the PHD

2579
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:21,238
research level and also is a home

2580
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:23,339
cannabis cultivator makes you

2581
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:26,399
exceptionally unique to be able to

2582
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:29,159
bridge between the academic science side

2583
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:31,559
of exudates and our beloved cannabis

2584
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:33,658
plant and so thank you for you know

2585
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:36,539
taking two hours and sharing it with us

2586
01:37:33,658 --> 01:37:38,519
so that uh that we can all become more

2587
01:37:36,539 --> 01:37:39,840
familiar with exudates it's been

2588
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:43,139
absolutely my pleasure pleasure thank

2589
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:46,619
you so much for having me fabulous so if

2590
01:37:43,139 --> 01:37:49,020
you want to keep up with Sarah Lane the

2591
01:37:46,619 --> 01:37:51,260
best place to do that is uh through her

2592
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:54,450
Twitter and her Twitter account is

2593
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:57,500

2596
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:07,379
place to keep up on her research and her

2597
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:10,379
interests if you happen to have a like a

2598
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:14,039
more of an elaborate question or comment

2599
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:15,719
perhaps than a you know a Twitter

2600
01:38:14,039 --> 01:38:18,238
account will allow

2601
