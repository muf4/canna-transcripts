1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,510
poly culture is becoming really popular

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,240
in cannabis both outdoors and even

3
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,490
indoors now and and the idea of poly

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:22,549
culture of course being planting other

5
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:24,379
plants with your cannabis and and one of

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,599
the things that I personally find really

7
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:29,750
engaging about that is that when when

8
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,849
plants are grown near each other they're

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,789
their roots in the rhizosphere can

10
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:36,500
interact and and if for shorthand we say

11
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:38,229
that the plants can talk to each other

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,189
right and that's certainly

13
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:41,479
anthropomorphizing and you know making

14
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:44,209
them sound like they have human

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:46,699
attributes but they are talking to each

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,170
other can you enlighten us and what the

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,230
what is going on

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:54,340
biologically below the soil which in

19
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:57,439
which we are calling talking right well

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,600
lots of different things obviously let's

21
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,729
start with a micro Raizel fungi we know

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,219
that a plant can share mycorrhizal fungi

23
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,679
with other plants and so you've got that

24
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:10,188
kind of talking where where nutrients

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,370
are going to two different plants you

26
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:15,319
know the mycorrhizal fungi itself is

27
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,880
feeding both of them and there's

28
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:21,408
interaction as a result we know that

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,379
carbon is transferred through that

30
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:26,540
mycorrhizal Network from plant to plant

31
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:28,298
so that a trick and the carbon goes into

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,229
the tree and then you find that same

33
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:33,100
radioactive carbon in the plants that

34
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:37,368
are nearby so we know that's happening

35
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:40,429
we know now that the plant signalling

36
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:42,290
system is very complex and and again

37
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,990
this is something I tried to cover and

38
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,820
team with

39
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,859
with nutrients but gets bear very

40
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,359
complicated and so you know if you think

41
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,340
of any of the pictures and teeming of

42
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,219
nutrients of an individual cell they're

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,130
these embedded proteins that are in the

44
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,719
cell some of which are outside the cell

45
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:59,908
and some of which are inside the

46
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,188
cytoplasm of the cell and those are used

47
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,649
for signaling often and so you'll get

48
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:09,239
for example calcium which is a very big

49
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:12,120
signaling molecule that the routing

50
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,560
element that will rub against you know I

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,259
want something on the outside of the

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,189
cell and a signal will go through the

53
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:21,449
through this into the into the cytoplasm

54
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:23,009
spread throughout the entire plant

55
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,359
because the all of these cells are

56
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,389
connected with these little holes

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,819
between them and so you get signaling in

58
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:31,259
and you get these ceilings often as a

59
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:33,419
result of things that are going on in

60
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:37,349
the soil so if the soil is low in

61
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:39,809
nitrogen that signal will be will be

62
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,879
sent throughout the plant but system

63
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,009
other plants in the area that signal

64
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,469
will be sent through them as well and it

65
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,399
may not be them sending the signal but

66
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,079
they're getting but they might be

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,299
carrying they're carrying so if the low

68
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:55,650
ground you get you get all of that kind

69
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:57,510
of chemical its chemical talking you get

70
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,209
the bacteria to talking to each other

71
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:02,879
and some of that is probably overheard

72
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,090
yeah every month deciding is definitely

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,370
the right word overheard by the plant

74
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:12,530
you know so so bacteria talk to each

75
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,239
other in terpenes this is getting cool

76
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,530
each other in terpenes well you don't

77
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,509
think the plant picks up some of those

78
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,669
terpenes the way the way I do the

79
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:23,129
comparison is you know you're in a big

80
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,018
crowd and you smell somebody and they're

81
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:29,009
crowded perfume listen let's be positive

82
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,859
you smell perfume woman far away that's

83
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,719
a signal and you're picking it up that's

84
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,239
a language between the two of you and so

85
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,759
very very interesting same thing happens

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,700
have been in the soil it also happens in

87
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,780
err so for example at the University of

88
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,878
I think it was the University of

89
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,878
Connecticut and a situation where they

90
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,280
had a greenhouse they stimulated the

91
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,378
plant in a way that they can get a

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,500
reaction from the plant in the

93
00:03:53,378 --> 00:04:00,340
greenhouse five miles

94
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:05,409
apparently away in another greenhouse

95
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:07,750
the plants react what you know so when

96
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:10,900
an aphid hits a plant the thing goes oh

97
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,489
oh I can't run and go tell my my little

98
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,010
kids that are out there that they if it

99
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,168
hit me but I can send the signal out to

100
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:18,819
them and does and the other plants

101
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,129
realize that there's an even in the area

102
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:24,129
start preparing defenses for it so it's

103
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:27,759
a chemical talking obviously we do we

104
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:31,089
have if with amorphous eyes it that's

105
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,069
the right way to say and that doesn't

106
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:36,599
mean it's not going on it is right now

107
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,599
that's totally cool thank you yeah

108
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,819
you
