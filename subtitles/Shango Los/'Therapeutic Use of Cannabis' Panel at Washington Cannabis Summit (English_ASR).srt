00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,939

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,309
want to just do to shout out to my

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:20,399
colleagues to my right and the right

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,989
amendments have known for many years and

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,570
the HD work at the University of

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:30,149
Washington I rely on her doctoral work

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:33,149
in order to develop surveys that I used

11
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:36,979
to serve a Washington State

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,980
medical cannabis patient sub woman

13
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:44,878
leader in seeing patients to medical

14
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,750
cannabis dispensaries as health care

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:51,058
facilities and then part of the right

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,369
documentary Stella I want to honor his

17
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,899
is that he actually interviewed me when

18
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,909
I was applying for admission to the

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,000
University of Washington

20
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:05,269
that was almost two years at 16 years

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,370
ago and I still remember that that day

22
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,859
was the first time that I you know wrote

23
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,600
now that I want to talk the researchers

24
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,790
and cannabinoids and that we actually

25
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,729
had researchers at the University to

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:20,270
work at researching cannabinoid

27
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,250
receptors and molecules that after Sarah

28
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:24,140
met with me he said well you actually

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,719
read something about this that's pretty

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,760
good that was it's nice comments they're

31
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,728
getting credit for cannabis science of

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,880
those discs right so anyway thank you

33
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:37,579
many ok so what I was gonna talk to you

34
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,609
guys about my time today is what time

35
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:45,109
what I'm doing in Washington State now

36
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:47,150
as a physician clinician and as I also

37
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:49,700
do teaching and I do a little bit of

38
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,219
research and I want to touch on some of

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,200
those things today I think Laura

40
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,519
committee thank you for writing and

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,909
actually they kind of described a little

42
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:02,509
bit of practice and then I also want to

43
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:05,200
put some regulator recommendations based

44
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:10,610
on what takes time seen in the trenches

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:13,330
so back in early of about a year ago I

46
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,400
started doing

47
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,739
integrated medicine practice had been

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,810
established UW Washington called stage

49
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,000
met Integrative Medicine which was

50
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,900
founded by some naturopathic physicians

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,969
station wheeler and I my friend there

52
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,010
who was also see patients in physical

53
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:33,799
medicine he invited me to come join us a

54
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:35,658
telepathic doctor the nd the group of

55
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:37,549
immigration practitioners so I was

56
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:40,189
excited about starting to expand my

57
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:42,590
practice like that and over the course

58
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:45,378
of last twenty seventeen I've moved it

59
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,539
from one day one day a month two days a

60
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:52,039
month and in November first away

61
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:54,348
full-time tell you this been quite an

62
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,929
experience and trip the kinds of things

63
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:59,089
you get to see you're no longer you know

64
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,799
an employee doc working the big system

65
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,310
but you're actually trying to kind of

66
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:06,349
see whoever comes to your door and

67
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:11,060
trying to help them in whatever ways you

68
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:12,768
can and my my areas of clinical training

69
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,568
are in reasonable physical medicine

70
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,780
rehabilitation and hospice and

71
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:19,098
palliative medicine and both of those

72
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,949
included training and pain management as

73
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:25,429
well so those are kind of the worlds

74
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:28,399
that I you know put out there and I've

75
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,980
made efforts over the last few months to

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,829
try to show her that I can see many

77
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:37,219
types of patients that I can see that I

78
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:39,020
can by accepting multiple forms of

79
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:42,020
payers I need

80
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,000
shows everything from all pretty much

81
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:49,189
all major private insurers in Washington

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,830
say starting sometime in early November

83
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:53,479
it's about added to Medicare so all

84
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,170
nations on Medicare which includes

85
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:59,569
people over the age of 65 and young

86
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:02,209
people who have chronic diseases such as

87
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,859
on hemodialysis who are also on Medicare

88
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,719
to each other they might be younger

89
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,170
because of disability or spinal cord

90
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,449
injury and I also was added to her rider

91
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:14,030
1 which is the state Medicaid for major

92
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:16,639
state Medicaid program - whose

93
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:21,560
Washington Health another is moving up

94
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:24,110
so that's that's also been kind of a new

95
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,189
experience of see the range of type of

96
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:30,020
patients from or to more well-off those

97
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:32,930
living with serious like writing

98
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:34,599
illnesses to those who are living with

99
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,110
chronic diseases to those who are

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,320
recovering from chronic diseases so

101
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:44,120
that's another feature of the practice

102
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,860
so what I what I've noticed what I'm

103
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,319
trying to do

104
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,598
they can have a side of things I'm kind

105
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,520
of calling it people call this cannabis

106
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:54,009
integrative medicine or cannabinoid

107
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,098
integrative medicine because you know

108
00:04:54,009 --> 00:05:02,038
cannabis needs to fit into some schema

109
00:04:57,098 --> 00:05:05,228
of clinical care it's certainly a great

110
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:09,128
medicine on its own but it's it's part

111
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:11,490
of traditional medicine systems where in

112
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:13,960
which plants have been the centerpiece I

113
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,319
pyruvate medicine traditional Chinese

114
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:20,019
medicine things like that and in my

115
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,900
practice I sort of see it as and how to

116
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:26,288
integrate it into the regular medical

117
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:29,318
care that people are you know receiving

118
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:32,199
so in our in our Seidman clinic we also

119
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:35,050
have acupuncturists physical therapists

120
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,538
massage therapists as those mentioned

121
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,520
naturopathic physicians including one

122
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:42,908
naturopathic physician is also advanced

123
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,848
registered nurse practitioner so this

124
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:48,819
gives me a chance to recommend the

125
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:51,370
patient's other types of care or I'll be

126
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:54,939
able to see how other forms of medicine

127
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,740
see them or how to what would candidates

128
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:01,870
do when patients are also receiving

129
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:04,060
acupuncture because if you guys could

130
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,009
study the endocannabinoid system you'll

131
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,228
see that cannabis isn't the only thing

132
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,169
that you know activates it or that can

133
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:13,699
be modulated connectors that make

134
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:16,459
essential functions and they're still

135
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:18,168
open tell me more about that

136
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,299
well there's research that's been done

137
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:21,859
on the use of electro acupuncture as a

138
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,110
way to stimulate and it can happen on

139
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:28,610
the skin and there's been research

140
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,819
osteopathic treatments as a way that

141
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:34,340
boost in the cannabinoid tone in the

142
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:36,469
spinal fluid and has been research on

143
00:06:34,339 --> 00:07:08,809
running and exercise as a way that

144
00:06:36,470 --> 00:07:11,960
increase research issues anyway this is

145
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,319
this is what really is it's open to the

146
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:20,589
study of cannabis overdose so much

147
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:26,029
deeper understanding of biological

148
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:28,519
systems animals pharmacy sports work so

149
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,869
it makes sense to be you know trying to

150
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,810
be a clinician clinical practitioners

151
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,610
have try to think about patients in this

152
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,850
time the frame record well what can you

153
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,189
do with your anything

154
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,200
it's potentially low or high or how

155
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:43,779
Mahajan if it's cannabis is a

156
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,759
homeostatic module Authority oh I mean

157
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:48,250
the NFF system is a homeostatic monetary

158
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,439
system and many naturopathic doctors

159
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,290
including Michelle Sexton who was

160
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,759
supposed up and met me still as loud she

161
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,819
is written about cannabis as an

162
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,589
adaptogen it's like ashwagandha which is

163
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:02,740
it works for every bit of medicine as

164
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:06,099
classified as an adaptogen of Tulsi so

165
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,620
how can we best utilize those in concert

166
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,150
the hard thing to do the hard thing

167
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,610
about this compared to my colleagues who

168
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:15,069
are doing you know a metabolic workup of

169
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,530
patients and using whole genome analysis

170
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:19,060
to understand are these patients low

171
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:21,279
methylated or do they have hormonal

172
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,399
deficiencies you can't really do that

173
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:28,449
with endocannabinoids at this time

174
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,099
because to draw blood sample figure out

175
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,549
somebody's independent own you have to

176
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,259
freeze that down I'm sure and every cell

177
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,479
ok tell you more about the complexities

178
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:38,950
of measuring actual in the contaminant

179
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,350
levels so we have to use clinical

180
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,629
markers and it's been really amazing to

181
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,509
use to learn things and Rousseau

182
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:48,909
people's you all know well in bastion of

183
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:50,139
the international leaders women's rings

184
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:52,469

185

migraine headaches fibromyalgia Airwolf

187
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,769
Alison's drone this kind of a triad

188
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,960
these included other conditions like the

189
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,750
Nutri osis and other conditions which

190
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,450
give us a sense into how patients might

191
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,399
have up these complexes symptoms and the

192
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,720
research studies have shown

193
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,909
might be involved so I've been able to

194
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,730
integrate to try to trial cannabis

195
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:20,289
products for these types of patients and

196
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,330
things seem there are some [ __ ] that

197
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:25,059
gotten quite quite a bit of a nice

198
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,330
results and so I'm very happy that the

199
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:31,000
medical system has available cannabinoid

200
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:34,750
ratio of compounds CBC exterior oral

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,429
extracts that I can use I must say I do

202
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:42,580
have challenges with trying to utilize

203
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:44,919
high OCD products because they're just

204
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,770
not so available and it's certainly true

205
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,839
a whole plant CBD rich extracts probably

206
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:52,090
you can get away with a lower dose than

207
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,120
what the research tanks have been done

208
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,889
with pure CBD so for example a recent

209
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,950
study the American Journal of Psychiatry

210
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:04,000
was in London on schizophrenia showed a

211
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,830
thousand milligrams of CBD a Jade was

212
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,539
effective for treating severe

213
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,850
schizophrenic patients prepare to do

214
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:11,740
they're actually already on your

215
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,940
standard antipsychotics and they added

216
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:18,610
CBD and they had a movement another step

217
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:21,100
well thanks from Raziel showed 300

218
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:26,200
milligrams of CBD was effective in

219
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:28,930
social anxiety and a recent preliminary

220
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,240
study from Yasmin herds team at Mount

221
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:33,159
Sinai showed four hundred eight hundred

222
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,539
milligrams is effective in a subject

223
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:39,759
undergoing heroin withdrawal so I mean

224
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:42,219
but where can you find four hundred

225
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,590
milligrams the CBD at neighborhood by

226
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,960
Leticia and how much

227
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,639
and maybe you know they just curious EBT

228
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,070
somebody who can get away with 50% of I

229
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,539
don't know it and have had patients who

230
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,490
have had success coming off of coma

231
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:58,039
hasn't a have which is also a 50

232
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,110
together over several years and we've

233
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,139
been able to do a slow post taper using

234
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,779
them I think he's using five to one CBD

235
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:09,110
THC ratio of eight pence and extracts

236
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:10,909
and that's been he's always more than

237
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,830
thirty forty percent down I've had

238
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:17,589
patients who didn't send both of them

239
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:20,690
straw many years is another typical

240
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:23,720
Karmapa and she's had a good success

241
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:27,080
with modulating some of her hyper hyper

242
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,420
arousal symptoms with CBD rich products

243
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,920
so I just just want to give you a

244
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:33,979
feeling of some of the things I also see

245
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:35,929
pediatric patients and adults I think

246
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,930
there are some challenges for uncovered

247
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:41,229
pediatric health conditions and licensed

248
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:43,699
drivers between the ages of 16 and 20

249
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,519
because if you're a licensed driver

250
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,990
between the ages of 16 and 20 and you

251
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:53,000
have you happen to have a medical

252
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:54,860
condition that benefit from cannabis you

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,389
can be medic without the rice but you

254
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,310
could if you're at risk

255
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:03,350
you know automatic conviction if you

256
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:04,849
have any amount of THC in the whole

257
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,370
blood study of some of the around

258
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,190
pending

259
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,610
police officer wants to do blood testing

260
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,620
and I have I have written sighs been

261
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,750
involved with some legal matter the

262
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,639
written letters for patients who had

263
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,600
some issues when they had an

264
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,929
alcohol-related

265
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,240
driving issues that were in their fault

266
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:27,709
or something like that so but we have no

267
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,730
call the Department of Health Campus

268
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:33,120
regulators and they just say no there's

269
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,009
nothing we can do for these drivers so

270
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,149
they just can't drive cars legally and

271
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:39,689
that's a problem

272
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:41,759
ditto on mental health conditions if you

273
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,980
do have anxiety and you don't have PTSD

274
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,220
or traumatic brain injury and we know

275
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,930
that has a utility properties and THC

276
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,480
CBD ratios can help with that

277
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:53,129
why aren't we allowed to authorize

278
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,680
patients to use that I think that has to

279
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:59,149
do with in a statement

280
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:01,639
conditions and then you know I feel like

281
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:03,470
we need to do some more with clearing up

282
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,620
the stigma of cannabis use in public

283
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:08,778
places and in health care facilities I

284
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,789
had spoken to the department of to

285
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:12,019
Christie weeks previous used to run the

286
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,879
program at the Department of Health and

287
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,829
she had said they have no issues with

288
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,539
cannabis use and health care facilities

289
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:21,080
hospitals nursing homes from the state

290
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:23,179
regulatory standpoint but I don't think

291
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,940
state facilities who are regulated by

292
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:27,919
the State Hospital Commission of the

293
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,660
state nursing home Commission know the

294
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,159
state has no issue with you know

295
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:33,079
qualified cannabis use in their

296
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,519
facilities and that would help to make

297
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,990
correct administrators in those

298
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,649
facilities more comfortable with

299
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,839
cannabis use with those patients and

300
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:45,379
people citizens should have access to

301
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,230
under the state law so those are just a

302
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:49,549
few of the health regulatory issues want

303
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,620
to touch on research and teaching I

304
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:56,240
can't really talk too much about trains

305
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:58,370
residents and medical students so I try

306
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,350
to pass this information on to future

307
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,690
generations coming up we'll have much

308
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,889
more of an understanding of these issues

309
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,420
because many of them are for after

310
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:07,909
medical marijuana even existed as a

311
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:09,569
thing they'd never know time without it

312
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:11,370
and

313
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,709
with doing work on cannabis and

314
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,799
traditional medicine and research side

315
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:19,768
and I have to deal with this contraband

316
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,620
and how to preserve traditional medical

317
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:25,370
uses such as India and other places

318
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,370
thanks

319
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:44,290
I so need to be very a room full of

320
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:48,269
leaders all of you all heaters and one

321
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:51,730
aspect of this industry or another and

322
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:54,370
where I would like to go over is how we

323
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,889
can create more leaders in the messaging

324
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,990
that we are to provide and different

325
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:05,710
ways that could get legalized and create

326
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:09,340
security for this industry legally I am

327
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:11,889
the CEO detox and we have been doing

328
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:16,290
kind of extractions about 22 years and

329
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:20,590
what when I came up awarded about 2009

330
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:21,849
it was pretty clear to me that of all of

331
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,950
the different kinds of methodologies

332
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,649
that the founder of the company had

333
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,470
created he's he's very very into the

334
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,419
chemicals as medicine and food and that

335
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,820
was the reason why I had moved from back

336
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:39,959
to Seattle or Miami was to get into

337
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:47,020
nutrition and as medicine food that path

338
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:48,610
but with what I realized there are a few

339
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,500
there were the extraction that knowledge

340
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,779
you have been reading and Achilles heel

341
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:59,759
for the industry primarily anything it

342
00:15:54,779 --> 00:16:05,620
so I said alright we are only going to

343
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:12,009
corrode co2 because without the pure

344
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:14,320
safe product there's no way this is

345
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:18,340
going to be more accessible without a

346
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,850
clear pathway for for fire departments

347
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,339
for the

348
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,379
police for medical applications for all

349
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:30,850
we could legalize on clementa without

350
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:36,198
that so we did and we created basically

351
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:39,829
co2 aspect of this whole industry we

352
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:46,278
have a million competitors now but

353
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:49,818
that's okay but for the founder of

354
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:52,970
myself and the entire company our main

355
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:56,599
purpose is is completely focused on

356
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,750
plants as nutrition and medicine and

357
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,300
getting a message across everything we

358
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:05,029
can possibly do to it because that is

359
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,889
our security for this industry and being

360
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:08,959
able to create successful businesses

361
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,480
that can they turn around and give that

362
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,279
same messaging back is how we create

363
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,500
more readers and how we continue to move

364
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:20,928
forward I came to be here because I am

365
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:25,068
in a tie first triple a check

366
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:26,769
personality I'm a total workaholic and I

367
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:29,170
recognize

368
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:30,970
and it would be really cool to create

369
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,940
some kind of retreat where people might

370
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,490
let myself go and get advice on

371
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,830
nutrition and exercise learning how to

372
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,200
take care of those cells because face it

373
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:43,928
that somebody just recently told me if I

374
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,240
don't get the oxygen mask first I can't

375
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,890
tell anybody else and so I want to make

376
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,529
it clear to all of you here because

377
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:55,020
think about that you all need an oxygen

378
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:59,859
mask first okay because without you

379
00:17:55,019 --> 00:18:01,960
as leaders there's nothing and yeah why

380
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:04,869
are the magazine's has been made 2002

381
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:08,308
said I own an article that Seattle was

382
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:11,139
being number one most likely placed that

383
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:11,889
socially responsible businesses would

384
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,070
come from

385
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:19,090
it's an epicenter for this so we are

386
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:20,859
perfectly situated in being interested

387
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:23,199
in sustainability and where he comes

388
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:25,419
from the employees and all of that it's

389
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,700
a perfect storm and I do a lot of

390
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:32,800
marital traveling I can tell you that we

391
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:34,269
live in hot knowledge bubble here all of

392
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,480
that all of the new extraction

393
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:41,319
methodologies that I have seen using

394
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,480
normal already established scientific

395
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:47,710
extraction technologies came from here

396
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:51,670
first so it's our responsibility to keep

397
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,940
this moving forward which is politician

398
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,940
again

399
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:06,449
this forage is a whole food and incise

400
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,880
orange we've got the pulp and then you

401
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,460
have us white stuff it's called pit and

402
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,559
inside of there are really important

403
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,500
nutrients it and actually the skin has

404
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:21,470
almost more vitamin C than that because

405
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,470
uphold us right you can juice this

406
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,410
but the danger just to having the juice

407
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:40,519
in that I can get too much sugar and we

408
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:42,200
can raise insulin levels and but as

409
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,389
opposed to just you know eating this

410
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,460
whole fruit obviously powders in the

411
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,350
hill it's also extremely nutrition and

412
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,340
to the nutritious that it's full of

413
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:55,539
delightful

414
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:59,449
terpenes cannabis is the same thing

415
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:02,930
except far far far beyond it is almost

416
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:06,440
trying to alter its high protein it has

417
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:12,620
what stuff perfect ratio Omega 6 Omega 3

418
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:15,890
oils it has this it has so many

419
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:19,579
different nutrients that we need that

420
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:23,480
actually is a food but I was talking

421
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:25,250
about that there's a great that the

422
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,890
gallop and irons look all through those

423
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,410
I fantastic external counter students

424
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,200
yet it's a better the butterfly sessions

425
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:36,890
and she is a beautiful job of whom are

426
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,970
feeding his concept of actually raw so

427
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:44,630
we've got primarily the GHC a CVA

428
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:49,100
which anybody can utilize for health

429
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:52,130
well-being and that is how we should be

430
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:55,339
marketing tennis because if we can it

431
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,770
through to everyone as far as it just

432
00:20:55,339 --> 00:21:00,149
being

433
00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:02,490
food then it's you can't categorize it

434
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,290
anymore is you can't just place it in

435
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:07,109
pharmaceuticals you can't just place it

436
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:10,079
in medical we're just recreational we

437
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:11,909
need to create the nutraceutical

438
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,159
definition in this country other

439
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,170
countries have a universal definition

440
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,640
which is the interplay of food with

441
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:25,400
medicinal values we don't but we can

442
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:28,530
look at it and we can create this market

443
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,390
all we have to do is focus on it and can

444
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:38,099
continue to create our leaders all of

445
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:40,830
these line as an obstruction today this

446
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:42,689
philosophy puts us in a very interesting

447
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:45,210
session because honestly you cannot

448
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,710
isolate anything it's nothing new

449
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,120
there's a whole lot of people isolating

450
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,130
different things I don't plant now it's

451
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:51,719
called a wonderful training you know

452
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,670
they're all excited about what get some

453
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,029
people oh you're doing that by it's

454
00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:01,350
forever that's the problem we started

455
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:03,899
taking components out of plants in the

456
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:08,059
eighteen hundreds so the first thing

457
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:11,940
that he took out a plan was working at

458
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:14,159
the corral do we really want to go down

459
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,100
that path with this plant because this

460
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,200
plant is our way out of that methodology

461
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:24,000
this plant can completely change our

462
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,809
entire medical system by utilizing what

463
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,539
we now know about in Canal

464
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:31,210
the prospect and having people's in

465
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:33,639
cannabinoid systems and analyze in

466
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,829
treating individual and in the

467
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,770
cannabinoid system deficiencies because

468
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:40,839
we all have up and we're all different

469
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:43,000
and so I would create compound

470
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:49,559
pharmacies for counting them to be

471
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:55,319
myself children's other guys we give up

472
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:55,319
compound pharmacies based on this planet

473
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:05,769
and many years ago when we first started

474
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:10,210
legalizing on CBE some of us knew what

475
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:11,920
kind of yes because and even well

476
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,220
welcome in Israel's been studied

477
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:19,480
historic well over a decade that CV

478
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:22,269
yellow is not that effective you have to

479
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,269
add to each see back in syrup CD has a

480
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:28,089
bell curve and they discovered this and

481
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:29,769
they added a little bit THD bucket it

482
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:34,480
needs up to having these creased

483
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:39,000
efficacy and then it's stabilized this

484
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:45,610
pilots telling us what we need to do and

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,808
yeah sure DVD because you're going to

486
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:53,409
figure out that once you've already

487
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:55,058
legalized once per fiends and we're

488
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,610
still going down that half but there's

489
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,960
still only a few of us group really in

490
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:01,599
the whole scheme of things to really

491
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,440
understand this and we have to messaging

492
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:08,529
you can have the best widget to have the

493
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,970
best poem over the entire planet but if

494
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:13,089
you don't message it and you don't

495
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:15,460
market it no one is going to know you

496
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:17,589
have to talk about it you have to make

497
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,720
it a part of every single marketing

498
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:22,149
thing that you can do and it just as far

499
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,679
as far as partners go think about you

500
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,929
know it's any other girls a lot of

501
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,019
farmers in this room and it has been

502
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:30,490
it's so unbelievable

503
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:33,099
you know wasn't it - what a product

504
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:36,640
heart it has been for the last couple

505
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:37,869
years big buck we had a la parka our

506
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,000
walk out of this rain

507
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:42,579
and how much more he would be able to

508
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,329
sell to be able to have that and the

509
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:48,699
normalization that that would bring to

510
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:50,289
them to the industry and a plan by just

511
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,179
saying well I'm just going to eat it but

512
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:54,759
that you know in and I'm going to juice

513
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:58,690
it it doesn't create that the excitement

514
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:00,970
of secretory feeling and it's just about

515
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:05,470
health and well-being and if we can get

516
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:09,660
that messaging across we'll all be more

517
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:13,380
secure now I don't want to downplay

518
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:16,330
isolates element obviously I slits are

519
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,030
awesome I just want to emphasize that

520
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:23,199
what we do to Iceland we do it

521
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:27,119
responsibly we can have we can have an

522
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:31,569
orange or we can take a vitamin C pill

523
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:34,659
and we take vitamin C L but if we're not

524
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:35,829
going to get the bio flavonoids we're

525
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,710
not going to get any of the other

526
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:41,740
properties but that this the reason why

527
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:44,230
this is on this planet was to beat us

528
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,680
basically and it's certainly with

529
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,900
cannabis I mean that is unbelievable

530
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:55,509
it isn't me we are made for each other

531
00:25:49,900 --> 00:26:06,340
and to be able to the faster - that is

532
00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:12,299
sad it makes me sad and I would like to

533
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:15,609
keep getting this message across it

534
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:21,639
recreating things for specific illnesses

535
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:25,059
is the tactic but we still have so far

536
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,370
to go to understand all what all of them

537
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:29,139
do are in the canal voices and how they

538
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:32,469
are defined been apart cause effect

539
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,670
works all of it it puts us to keep open

540
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:39,279
minds that keep us that's a

541
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:41,560
responsibility alive and well and so

542
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,039
that we can all continue to grow and we

543
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:49,769
can change so many other things that

544
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,769
this planet is speaking to us to change

545
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:04,299
[Applause]

546
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,589
so my name is a man arraignment and

547
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,659
first I want to say that the idea is

548
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:12,049
find an end of commanding a deficiency

549
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:14,150
syndrome online world and agility I mean

550
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:17,359
I totally hear you coming from a the

551
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,200
idea that we could actually assess the

552
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,909
functioning of someone's

553
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,920
endocannabinoids with someone they are

554
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,690
very young and and given supplemental

555
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,600
therapies so that they never develop

556
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,850
epilepsy or they never develop MS I mean

557
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,319
it's a game changer I tell all the

558
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:32,509
students I know that if you are at all

559
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,730
interested in science go into the field

560
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:41,269
of endocannabinoids research because

561
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:43,099
it's going to be so CO and I we're

562
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:44,539
saying you're getting lunch today that

563
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,459
we don't know you get to spend on

564
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:48,589
bananas together anymore because there

565
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,329
was a time 15 years ago but they were so

566
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:51,740
few cannabis scientists that anytime

567
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:55,220
they wanted to science you know we're

568
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,769
all on it but now we have had

569
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,930
opportunity to diversify to where you

570
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:02,269
know we have the biologists so the

571
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,490
genome scientists the social scientists

572
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:06,349
and the addiction researchers who are

573
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,809
all starting to specialize in cannabis

574
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:11,000
and I get really excited when I get

575
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:12,409
emails from PhD students and grad

576
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,450
students who say I'm doing my

577
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,300
dissertation on cannabis I'm doing

578
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,519
projects on cannabis because I want to

579
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:21,769
do it forever and I really want to be

580
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:25,009
able to give the range to the younger

581
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:28,009
generation but I feel that as we move

582
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:30,299
more towards legitimacy and regulation

583
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:32,849
there's a sense or the

584
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:34,529
movement behind cannabis that doesn't

585
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:36,059
always come along with that transfer of

586
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:38,759
knowledge for transferring knowledge

587
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,049
about cell cultures for transferring

588
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,599
knowledge about the interview happened

589
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:44,250
wait system a remedy transferring the

590
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,139
knowledge about the culture and the

591
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,089
importance of the social movement that

592
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,220
was medical cannabis so that's really

593
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:52,470
what I want to touch on a bit today when

594
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,470
I talk about part of my own research

595
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:58,170
capital world so just to say right now

596
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,420
my current position is not in research

597
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,610
fully I work with a company in

598
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,680
California called flow Cana which is a

599
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:07,109
branded cannabis distribution company

600
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,480
that works with small sun-grown farmers

601
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:11,789
and Mendocino and Humboldt County is

602
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,069
also the Mendocino County so Mendocino

603
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:15,690
humble Trinity make up the Holy Grail

604
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:17,369
the Emerald triangle so if you're

605
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,720
interested in that part of my life I

606
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:20,519
mean more than happy to talk with you

607
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,440
about it during the networking session

608
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:26,009
or dinner tonight but today I'm talk

609
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,900
about science so you know as studio was

610
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:30,599
talking about the synergistic effects of

611
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,690
cannabinoids and things like acupuncture

612
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,459
and masturbation I think that how I

613
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,620
could best describe the work that I do

614
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,829
is very similar to us do kneeled I've

615
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:42,539
accepted a 10,000 foot view so my

616
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:44,730
interests have always been the

617
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,339
intersection between cannabis and

618
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,890
different aspects of social justice

619
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:52,169
healthcare social movements of equity

620
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,750
equality because I feel like cannabis

621
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:57,029
touches all of those aspects and in many

622
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,559
ways throughout our history cannabis has

623
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:00,930
been part of a catalyst for social

624
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,869
change and it continues to be that today

625
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:05,910
it was that back to the 1960s when we

626
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:08,279
started the war on drugs basically to

627
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,340
jail people who were using cannabis to

628
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,139
promote social change it's continued

629
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:14,409
through people getting their children

630
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,150
take it away

631
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,650
some medical refugees because they want

632
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,800
to make good healthcare decisions for

633
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,170
their families it continues on with the

634
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,819
small sun-grown farmers that refused to

635
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,279
go away a large industrialized

636
00:30:24,819 --> 00:30:29,710
agriculture and instead want to change

637
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,710
the way we do food production in the US

638
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:34,450
rather than go that direction so

639
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,549
cannabis has been involved in all of

640
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,500
that and I think it's very important for

641
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:40,869
anybody who hopes to be successful in

642
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,079
this industry to really understand the

643
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:46,000
history of cannabis as a social movement

644
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:49,449
so I moved to the Bay Area to Oakland in

645
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,609
2002 from Chicago I really had no idea

646
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,190
about medical cannabis except the small

647
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:55,959
bits I'd seen on the news when I arrived

648
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,700
in the Bay Area I became a medical

649
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,559
cannabis patient because I ended using

650
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,990
cannabis to treat my own arthritis for

651
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:04,419
years in Chicago worse very very much

652
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,279
the illicit market when I started at

653
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,320
this dispensaries back then in the early

654
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:10,629
2000s in Oakland Berkeley in San

655
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:13,779
Francisco what I noticed was something

656
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:15,730
very unique cannabis aside saw also a

657
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:18,009
PhD student at Berkeley in social

658
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,809
welfare so the idea was that I was kind

659
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:22,150
of studying social movements and the

660
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:23,829
social welfare program and what I saw

661
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,350
when I went to those early dispensaries

662
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:28,629
was unlike anything I had seen in any

663
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:31,149
other area health care which is a truly

664
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,970
socialized community-based healthcare

665
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:36,340
system that did not just tolerate

666
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,950
marginalized populations but actually

667
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:41,740
actively sought to care for marginalized

668
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:44,470
populations and this was more out of HIV

669
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,109
activism an LGBTQ movement in San

670
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,390
Francisco so just a little bit of a quiz

671
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:50,539
and this is not going to take away your

672
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,000
ability to do any

673
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:56,569
later how many of you have heard of

674
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,299
brownie Mary Radford okay and how many

675
00:31:56,569 --> 00:32:02,599
of you have heard of despereaux all

676
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:04,099
right that's good so actually a little

677
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,779
brief history for those of you who may

678
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:09,019
not know who these folks are

679
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:10,700
so back in San Francisco in the 1980s

680
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:12,740
and the AIDS epidemic was in full swing

681
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,539
and as many of you know who are old

682
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,849
enough to remember there was a lot of

683
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:18,740
misinformation about how HIV was spread

684
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:20,990
there were spots that could be spread by

685
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,910
hugging or by using someone's toilet

686
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,130
seat or by wearing the same piece of

687
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,480
clothing as them and wasn't just that

688
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,920
people who are patients that believe

689
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,349
this was the doctors and it was the

690
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,090
nurses so the advice they gave to family

691
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:34,189
members when someone was diagnosed was

692
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:37,339
welcoming the last time you know be

693
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:40,970
careful and so these folks suffered a

694
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:42,919
great deal of social isolation and a

695
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,079
death sentence on top of that and

696
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,640
horrific side effects from the

697
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,099
medication that were available at the

698
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,680
time or not having access to medications

699
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:54,379
at all so there are two figures that

700
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,039
emerged at this time one was brownie

701
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,130
Mary

702
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,619
brownie berry was a volunteer accent sf

703
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,930
General Hospital in maids work she would

704
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:05,569
go and visit with the patients there and

705
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:07,009
she would bring them hot brownies and

706
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:08,599
she would tell anybody who was in the

707
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:10,129
brownies that she would bring a minute

708
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:12,679
she'd be given to the patients and he

709
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,690
would absolutely help the side-effects

710
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,519
of their medications and the symptoms of

711
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,500
having the disease there was another

712
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:21,230
gentleman in San Francisco Denis Perot

713
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,500
within an activist for some time and his

714
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,599
partner had HIV so many of you may have

715
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,250
seen the movie Dallas buyers club where

716
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:30,349
you see folks kind of lined up outside

717
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,539
the house to get their HIV medication

718
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:33,059
well picture that in the Haight Ashbury

719
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:34,649
neighbor

720
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:36,899
San Francisco about giving away

721
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,580
candidates and so this was an

722
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,470
opportunity not just for folks to get

723
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:42,359
the medicine they needed to actually

724
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,579
engage in a community that wasn't afraid

725
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:46,139
of them to engage the community that

726
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:48,029
would touch them that would give them

727
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,060
the care that they were looking for and

728
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:51,839
the early dispensary system of the Bay

729
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:55,470
Area

730
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,149
absolutely reflected that community so

731
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,640
that when you walked into the dispensary

732
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:02,280
the suspensory there was a train we lay

733
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,530
on the table with rolling papers for

734
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:07,079
anybody that needed it there was free

735
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:09,150
food available there was a lawyer there

736
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,250
in case you had a legal case pending he

737
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,559
needed some free legal advice there was

738
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,780
peer counseling there was doggy daycare

739
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,639
for folks who had to go to doctors

740
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,800
appointments all day didn't have anyone

741
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,230
to look after their dogs there was free

742
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,760
internet access but in the early 2000s

743
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,740
there was still a huge digital divide

744
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,500
going on with folks didn't have access

745
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,019
to that and it would keep it hang out

746
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,389
all day long and consume cannabis and do

747
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:36,210
art projects and play in the garden and

748
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:38,398
have sense of community well as somebody

749
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,010
was studying social welfare I was like

750
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,929
this does not happen this does not

751
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,010
happen in any other sector of care I

752
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:46,260
don't care if you're going to a

753
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,649
chiropractor's office or a gynecologists

754
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,780
office

755
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:51,329
you're not going to see the sense of

756
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,909
community care so I decided to do my

757
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:56,819
doctoral dissertation on how these

758
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:59,099
medical cannabis facilities I'll take

759
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,100
about a second we're operating as

760
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:04,349
healthcare providers because I knew that

761
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,239
as we got more into regulation we were

762
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,309
going to see these social model

763
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,879
dispensaries kind of become Walgreens

764
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:15,599
and CVS and we have so I felt that it

765
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,400
was very important to capture what was

766
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,159
happening

767
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,889
this time cuz cannabis was really

768
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:24,078
leading us into and alternative health

769
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:26,420
care way that we've seen taken off since

770
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,849
then coupled with the intersection of

771
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,278
people being more and more concerned

772
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:33,109
about pharmaceutical drugs so I said

773
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:34,818
medical cannabis facilities and I just

774
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:36,710
said this to Cathy opposite schools I

775
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:39,318
think a great piece of history so in

776
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,690
2002 the dispensaries were afraid to

777
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:43,880
call themselves dispensaries they were

778
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,760
afraid that it would implicate them has

779
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,818
dispensing something to the public which

780
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,730
in California except for prop 215 which

781
00:35:49,818 --> 00:35:54,858
is basically one paragraph and they

782
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,028
really didn't have permission to do so

783
00:35:54,858 --> 00:35:58,670
they didn't want to be mean as

784
00:35:56,028 --> 00:36:00,588
dispensaries in my research but fear of

785
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,500
legal retribution so they asked to be

786
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:05,420
called facilities it's because they felt

787
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:09,739
that it would be safer for them anyway

788
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:11,990
so I did this study back in 2006 and I

789
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:14,659
did a study a 130 medical cannabis

790
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:16,159
patients to find out more about how they

791
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:18,318
were utilizing the centuries of what

792
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,358
they were getting from that just to give

793
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:23,088
you an idea of how little we knew back

794
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:25,278
then this was 16 years ago a hundred and

795
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:27,769
thirty patients it was the largest

796
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:30,269
sample of medical cannabis patients in

797
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:34,500
existence

798
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:36,119
it's nothing and so out of this survey

799
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,670
which I have to give credit to dr.

800
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,769
Freeman Seto and dr. Tommy areaa who

801
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:43,170
really pioneers in the medical

802
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:45,570
profession in cannabis dr. Vickery being

803
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,369
a psychiatrist dr. Macedo being a family

804
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,280
practitioner one of the first office in

805
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:52,140
California to wacom on cannabis Hey very

806
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,090
long and extensive intake form that he

807
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:56,730
asked all of his patients to go out

808
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:59,340
Iraq ugly from this intake form for my

809
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:02,760
dissertation research instrument and one

810
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:05,280
of the questions on that survey was are

811
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,590
you using cannabis as a substitute for

812
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,600
something else now I just threw the

813
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,550
question on their indexes on doctoral

814
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,339
students survey didn't make too much now

815
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:16,470
that until I saw the results and I saw

816
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,059
that 53% of my samples that they were

817
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:21,419
using cannabis as a substitute for

818
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:23,099
alcohol and then 75% of my samples that

819
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,190
they were using cannabis as a substitute

820
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:27,900
for pharmaceutical drugs and 25% of my

821
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,750
sample said that they were using it as a

822
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,460
substitute for illicit substances and I

823
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,469
thought wow you know the production

824
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,300
which I use a very big fan of as

825
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:37,829
paradigm you know the idea that you

826
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,420
don't have to demand abstinence from

827
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:41,099
someone who's using substances in order

828
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,840
to make their lives better in fact a lot

829
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,980
of time to make their lifes worse that

830
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:50,309
they're not ready to go that route

831
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:53,159
anyway but I saw that and I thought this

832
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:55,049
is really interesting because if we can

833
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:57,118
think about cannabis instead of a

834
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,640
gateway drug that's being an exit drug

835
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,500
then me there's some potential for it as

836
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,000
an addiction treatment so first you see

837
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,108
something interesting to research the

838
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,389
first thing you want to do is replicate

839
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:08,340
that research to see if what you found

840
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:10,618
is just a fluke or if there's really

841
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,079
something there so I replicated that

842
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,269
study and a few years later with 350

843
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,489
patients and I found the same thing and

844
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:19,230
then my colleague Philippe Lucas I'm in

845
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:21,629
Canada replicated

846
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,820
but thousand patients in Canada let me

847
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,309
tell the same thing and so we really

848
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,890
felt that we were on to the fact that

849
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:30,659
patients were absolutely engaging in

850
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,269
this substitution behavior and that they

851
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:35,099
were having good outcomes and results

852
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:37,469
from that really more to the discussion

853
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,750
about the opioid epidemic and the role

854
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:42,118
that cannabis could play in helping this

855
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,250
now we see a population-based data on

856
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,559
this the study that came out in 2015 in

857
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:49,050
JAMA that showed of 25% reduction in

858
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:52,019
opiate related mortality in places that

859
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:54,060
have cannabis laws we see significant

860
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:56,009
reductions in Medicare Part D

861
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:58,769
reimbursements for opiates and states

862
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,090
that have access to cannabis we see all

863
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,130
of this really great data on the

864
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,530
population level and then we hear

865
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:07,559
patients saying oh this absolutely works

866
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:08,850
yes yes like 99% of patients say that it

867
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,279
worked they did a study on this last

868
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:13,139
year they all really liked it when we

869
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,600
haven't been able to do largely because

870
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:18,179
of both the addiction paradigm that we

871
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,980
have decided is OK in this country and

872
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,079
because the schedule 1 status of

873
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,510
cannabis is really studying this as a

874
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,029
clinical outcome study we're imagining

875
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,859
patients who are using opiates and

876
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:30,869
patients are using cannabis and seeing

877
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:32,699
what they're doing now the first of

878
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,350
these studies is actually now taking

879
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:36,509
place at the Albert Einstein Medical

880
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:39,358
School in New York which is extremely

881
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,560
exciting but we have a lot of work to do

882
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,690
if we're really going to move forward

883
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,909
with cannabis as a viable treatment for

884
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,920
substance use disorder part of the

885
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:48,629
problem is as you know the line drawn

886
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,760
between licit and illicit drugs is

887
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,200
completely arbitrary in this country who

888
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,090
have done a very good job of convincing

889
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:55,889
people that all the drugs on one side of

890
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:58,410
the line or ok and all the drugs on the

891
00:39:55,889 --> 00:40:00,480
other side got my own horrible so we

892
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:02,159
have to have that conversation we

893
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,210
haven't had a conversation about what it

894
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,440
means for patients can have

895
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,449
self-determination

896
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,240
about how they choose to get better and

897
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:10,649
the methods they choose to get better we

898
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,419
have to have conversations about the

899
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,309
paternalism that we place upon

900
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,108
especially women and people of color in

901
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:17,179
this country about what we think they

902
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:21,049
need to do the proof

903
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:23,419
to us and cannabis again intersects with

904
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:25,160
all of this so I guess the last thing

905
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,050
I'm going to say if as you forward your

906
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,210
cannabis businesses very few of you

907
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:31,760
maybe not even any of your researchers

908
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,980
but keeping with you the idea of the

909
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,990
evolution of cannabis in the social

910
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,659
space it's going to be extremely

911
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:41,568
important and ensuring that the next

912
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:44,118
wave of cannabis commerce is really in

913
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:47,239
line with that social movement that I

914
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,010
first saw 15 years ago and doesn't go

915
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,659
the way the pharmaceutical industry and

916
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,510
doesn't go the way of industrialized

917
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:55,368
agriculture we get to decide that and

918
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,710
one of the ways we do that is by

919
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:59,960
transferring the knowledge not just the

920
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,449
technical knowledge but the cultural

921
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,608
knowledge and the research knowledge and

922
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:06,769
the clinical knowledge it's just as

923
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:08,480
important so thank you so much again for

924
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:11,139
having me and for talking to about

925
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,139
making

926
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:25,038
good afternoon my name is Randy Simmons

927
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:29,759
so I was asked again dismantle all night

928
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:32,190
my response were pretty sure I really

929
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,680
started that conversation by saying I'm

930
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,030
not sure anything to offer then I gotta

931
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,739
listen through the other panelists or

932
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:42,780
any say that must be here for the comic

933
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:45,118
relief the back cannot match what they

934
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:52,069
have done within this industry one thing

935
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:55,068
I can talk about - and two years ago

936
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:55,068
sorry

937
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,410
my friend

938
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,740
six years ago I walked away from

939
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,980
this probably wants to punch our way

940
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,690
that we have my life

941
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,869
we're doing pretty people some of you in

942
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,869
this room

943
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,680
some of us not always on the same page

944
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:36,210
in this room but there was a passion you

945
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:39,989
know I think about the passionate people

946
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:40,920
at our Mullins industry and and I hated

947
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:45,529
walking away

948
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,530
yeah hit a lot like the faculty member

949
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:51,259
donates is trying to the energy in his

950
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:57,139
life it's a supporting military

951
00:42:51,260 --> 00:43:00,990
survivors of our efforts in fact they

952
00:42:57,139 --> 00:43:03,599
pedal again for 22 too many that I wear

953
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:05,519
every give me and others it's gonna

954
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,710
scream in a shared over the years like

955
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:11,119
no tears are going to walk away and

956
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:18,809
what's going on in my life in two years

957
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:27,730
it's been dominated by cancer so

958
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:28,539
my wife 43 years in October a couple of

959
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,829
years back

960
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:36,940
have no cancer in her body by June she

961
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:42,279
was at stage three breast cancer which

962
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:44,200
had entered the lymph node systemtm and

963
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,780
so then how do you feel about me and

964
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:49,139
that's consuming but one of the things

965
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,640
that it's done is it consumed me as a

966
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:52,929
vise try to figure out what it is you're

967
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:57,690
dealing with it

968
00:43:52,929 --> 00:44:01,359
in the unfortunate aspect that that is

969
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:04,030
ports an enforcement we let to CL Cancer

970
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,730
Care Alliance witches for the one of the

971
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,840
better cancer centers in the world in

972
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,400
fact there are about a lot of people

973
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,950
from other countries that were there

974
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:17,829
because of the care and services

975
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:19,719
provided but was upset upset me and

976
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:23,199
press straightly to watch what had

977
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:25,449
happened for a couple reasons one watch

978
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,949
over 16 week period was my wife's body

979
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:30,369
was filled with poisons that was

980
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:32,019
intended to kill the cancer but if

981
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:33,639
you're working on those and three

982
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:36,519
different types of chemo medicine during

983
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:39,429
that period of time that killed not only

984
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:41,800
the cancer cells but they Phil help the

985
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:43,690
cells and then here in that process are

986
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:48,039
trying to rebuild their body after that

987
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:50,200
point and following that was surgery

988
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:53,079
bilateral mastectomy that she went

989
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:55,899
through people hope she only had cancer

990
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,900
in on one side she is a bright happy

991
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,059
gene individual which means that her

992
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,530
chances are 80% that she would

993
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:06,610
eventually have a cancer on the other

994
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:09,340
side and a removable of her ovaries rat

995
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:10,840
was fed by estrogen and those things

996
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,460
work together to spend she would

997
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,160
continue to go through this process of

998
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,260
dealing and after that radiation which

999
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:20,440
was a seven week period

1000
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,840
radiation L up in RCL and North get

1001
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:26,079
there is the proton therapy sampler

1002
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:28,230
which uses a new type of radiation which

1003
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,960
doesn't go all the way through the body

1004
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:34,780
photon radiation that most people get

1005
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,940
was not something that my wife to use

1006
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,460
because she has a heart issue in that

1007
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:42,970
book to burn the part so using proton

1008
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,590
radiation via for the opportunity to not

1009
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:48,159
have the radiation go all the way

1010
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:49,960
through her body the downside of that is

1011
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,849
the insurance companies don't cover that

1012
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,610
radiation and that was hundred and forty

1013
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:59,739
nine thousand dollar bill the insurance

1014
00:45:54,610 --> 00:46:02,140
companies would not cover thankfully and

1015
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:04,389
gratefully many organizations came

1016
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:13,059
together to share that cost and some of

1017
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:13,329
us red shirt that cost well what did I

1018
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:16,750
do

1019
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:18,519
I start looking you know research that's

1020
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:21,550
done research of these people have done

1021
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:22,769
is amazing and there's so much more of

1022
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:25,390
these happen

1023
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:27,400
and the thing that holds us back is no

1024
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:30,159
different today than almost two weeks

1025
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,340
ago or two years ago it's no different

1026
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:36,309
after mr. sessions made this comment son

1027
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:38,470
loss prior we need the change were as a

1028
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:40,039
nation and that review of this plenty of

1029
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:43,039
us be business a plan

1030
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:44,840
many beneficial aspects to it as long as

1031
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,190
it's the schedule of substance we're not

1032
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,470
going to be able to do the research or

1033
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:51,349
get the research funding so we need to

1034
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:53,449
turn our attention to having changes

1035
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:55,190
made at the national level which means

1036
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:56,919
when you go home and I please all of you

1037
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:59,570
write letters to your elected officials

1038
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,880
because right now the doors are open for

1039
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:04,700
about you know and they give us a

1040
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,740
Republican senator from Colorado stood

1041
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:08,960
up and said you're wrong we need to do

1042
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:10,519
something so what we need is continue

1043
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,559
the same things have been doing for less

1044
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:14,750
several years I'm trying to move the

1045
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:18,049
normalization of this plant in this

1046
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:19,849
nation to something other than a drug

1047
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:25,250
that Richard Nixon hatred because he

1048
00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:27,349
didn't like it that's moving in a

1049
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:29,539
direction to continue to move to the

1050
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:32,839
normalization of this plant so we can

1051
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:34,639
take that medical benefits from it the

1052
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,460
nutritional benefits growing because

1053
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,349
there's so much that we don't know and

1054
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,990
until we hit the point where we can get

1055
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:45,500
funding and we can have people not on

1056
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:46,879
small research projects that the large

1057
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,059
research projects you heard earlier

1058
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,619
today about the fact people from

1059
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:54,309
universities go and have some bills to

1060
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:57,019
the detective work what we're the best

1061
00:47:54,309 --> 00:48:01,360
universities in the world why are we not

1062
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:01,360
allowing them to do the research on this

1063
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:07,220
so as my wife this was released Riina's

1064
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,969
I started doing research my summer

1065
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:12,778
broadband service

1066
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:15,329
and but that they are presented by dr.

1067
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:17,159
Christine Christine Sanchez in the

1068
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:19,079
University of the credit and the work

1069
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:22,048
that she's now moved into her prep lab

1070
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:26,640
there on cancer yeah if you look at some

1071
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:28,108
of the American media and the stories of

1072
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,598
work she's done in the box about how

1073
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:32,880
she's slow down the cancer growth using

1074
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:35,969
cannabis that's not true if she's kill

1075
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,289
cancer cells plasma cannabis and that's

1076
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:38,969
the story that needs to give out hope

1077
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,890
that she's slowed it down but she's

1078
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:44,369
filling and if you look at the work that

1079
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:47,429
dr. new at the University of London has

1080
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:52,229
done in the combination of chemo with

1081
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:56,578
cannabis the result is that we can get

1082
00:48:52,228 --> 00:49:01,649
by killing this gene or this cell with a

1083
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:04,200
lot less chemotherapy drugs a lot less

1084
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:07,259
attack to the body and no recovery time

1085
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:09,568
you know no loss of hair no neuropathy

1086
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:13,710
and all the other things go along with

1087
00:49:09,568 --> 00:49:15,179
chemo for cancer patients so we need to

1088
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,249
look at this where this to be invalid

1089
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:20,038
places and ended up open up what's going

1090
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:21,389
on in this nation so I was asked to

1091
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:25,440
speak here today to present testimony

1092
00:49:21,389 --> 00:49:27,629
idea that a recent hearing and somebody

1093
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,099
heard that test no one asked me to come

1094
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,470
to tell its story so that's what was

1095
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:34,170
here but he has to be about my passion

1096
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:36,209
what's your passion the other - for

1097
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:41,400
something then go after and keep doing

1098
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:45,289
it this has become him like my son is

1099
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:47,579
protected she's sitting right over there

1100
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:49,769
to be right I really move forward

1101
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:53,519
because she's through a female she's

1102
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:56,009
through it surgery if she's there for a

1103
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,800
deviation she's not pretty cancer the

1104
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:01,160
impacts on her body from these drugs and

1105
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,320
for these treatments all right relax and

1106
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:07,739
we'll continue so what have we been

1107
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,990
doing to counteract that well been using

1108
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:12,659
the cannabis oils on her neuropathy

1109
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:14,519
interpret because to bring that feeling

1110
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:17,848
back into us

1111
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:19,139
increase that blood flow again also

1112
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:23,359
encourage Emmet's use with care

1113
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:23,358
providers encasing vents to know that

1114
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:31,829
again we need to look at what is

1115
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,679
happening within the medical

1116
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:36,539
professional and the insurance

1117
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:39,059
profession so you've heard earlier here

1118
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:40,858
today about an opportunity for all of

1119
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:42,900
you are there is a travel insurance

1120
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:45,000
pelisses stop there was definitely what

1121
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,338
they have insurance covers yeah so we

1122
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,139
needed a change in both a medical

1123
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:51,230
professional

1124
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:54,589
medical world and in the insurance world

1125
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:57,079
to make sure that the profits that could

1126
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,030
be developed out of this plan and the

1127
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:01,130
research that can be done to make sure

1128
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,290
that we have the right can have a high

1129
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:09,440
profile and see what the truth is do

1130
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:13,190
based on different diseases on cancer

1131
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,900
cells do they'll say we need research

1132
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:18,380
diamond so I kinda like that

1133
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:21,829
advertisement here today but good that's

1134
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:23,539
what I care for you know I really

1135
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:26,900
appreciate this panel I appreciate you

1136
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:31,070
have medical doctors that will step out

1137
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:33,710
and look at how the use of employees can

1138
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:36,289
benefit their patients appreciate over

1139
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:38,599
research that's done at many levels and

1140
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:43,219
to think back about it in the early

1141
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:49,449
years you know that medical cannabis use

1142
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:49,449
grow the idea of legalization and

1143
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:56,650
I'm really hoping that to push for legal

1144
00:51:54,179 --> 00:52:00,068
recreational marijuana in the other

1145
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:01,900
states returns the favor and versus the

1146
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:03,909
discussion about what can we do on a

1147
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,950
national level if we remove the

1148
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:09,038
substances get to one and what the

1149
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:12,838
medical communities really do the work

1150
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:15,519
they need to do to figure out how to

1151
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:17,980
change people's lives for the better and

1152
00:52:15,518 --> 00:52:20,469
so we can eliminate diseases who look at

1153
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,869
GW Pharmaceuticals happening on what

1154
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:26,488
they've done with oral spray for

1155
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:30,450
epilepsy seizures the drug that they

1156
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:34,568
call a drug that X Factor working on for

1157
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:37,088
elimination of type 2 values we all need

1158
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:38,679
to be aware of those things that are

1159
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:40,869
going on and we need to pressure the

1160
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:44,139
elected officials in this nation to move

1161
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:50,130
that same direction because then we all

1162
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:50,129
get the benefits or ourselves and

1163
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:10,449
thank you for sharing that the stories

1164
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:16,239
those are the stories that are living us

1165
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:20,159
and gives a lot of sense to Bridget she

1166
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:24,069
also wanted to thank you Clara for and

1167
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:27,879
Oscar who introduced me to this to this

1168
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:31,420
venue this is my second year and I think

1169
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:34,150
it's such an incredible gathering the

1170
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:38,440
cannabinoid ecosystem that brings every

1171
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:42,809
part of this new chapter in Arizona the

1172
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,809
agriculture to research to the policy

1173
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:53,940
so scientists on a basic researcher that

1174
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:57,538
studies you can have no it's the inning

1175
00:53:53,940 --> 00:54:00,950
system or about 25 years

1176
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:03,749
I'm a both a biologist ever

1177
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:07,218
pharmacologists so I think about how

1178
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:10,768
molecules travels in your body and how

1179
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:13,019
they act on our different organs how

1180
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:16,558
they affect our brains and how they

1181
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:19,468
affect different types of activities and

1182
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,798
they're saying that for about 25 years

1183
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:24,298
and about 20 years ago when I came here

1184
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:29,038
at the University of Washington and

1185
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:32,818
started by now and the initial idea was

1186
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:35,369
that 20 years ago a lot of people were

1187
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:37,259
telling me that I was crazy our spending

1188
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:40,229
you can have no ministers getting one

1189
00:54:37,259 --> 00:54:44,969
license whether you do that but there

1190
00:54:40,228 --> 00:54:46,960
was already some evidence that cannabis

1191
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:49,990
had a very promising

1192
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,619
medical properties and so I thought well

1193
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:56,379
and the other advantage that the

1194
00:54:53,619 --> 00:55:00,329
cannabis has is what we call it has a

1195
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:03,880
very safe therapeutic index if the

1196
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:06,639
profile of side-effects is very very low

1197
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:11,710
so to the afters there's no borders

1198
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:13,839
there's that there's a very safe

1199
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:18,389
everything and that's what we want when

1200
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,390
they want to have new medicines

1201
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:28,509
also say disease but don't induce often

1202
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:35,409
so I thought thought I'd start spending

1203
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:39,359
that try to optimize those medical it

1204
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:43,598
was they don't feel that I came into the

1205
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:46,000
cannabinoid research field because it

1206
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,039
was the last drug that people started to

1207
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,800
understand people already understood at

1208
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:51,460
how methamphetamine one is how food

1209
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,700
works

1210
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:57,099
twenty years ago we only knew what the

1211
00:55:54,699 --> 00:56:00,519
molecule was didn't have any ideas of

1212
00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:05,470
the cannabinoid system so it was a very

1213
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:08,250
exciting field or career scientists

1214
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:08,250
there's a lot of

1215
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:15,369
and in shaping the research that we did

1216
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,039
in my laboratory the first thing we did

1217
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:21,339
is be listen to the patients if you want

1218
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:25,239
to she wants to develop a therapeutic

1219
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:27,640
approach that start with something that

1220
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:30,609
has a lot of promises and to multiple

1221
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:33,940
sclerosis and so we're very strong so we

1222
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:35,829
studied how normally have

1223
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:40,119
anti-inflammatory properties for many

1224
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:42,969
years the two more recent types of

1225
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:44,949
research that we've been doing in my

1226
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:47,319
laboratory or again

1227
00:56:44,949 --> 00:56:50,139
because of their strongest evidence one

1228
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,210
is the evidence of feeling it's I think

1229
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:52,690
absolutely remarkable what's happening

1230
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:56,500
today

1231
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:58,090
I'm particularly touched because the

1232
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,610
therapeutic approaches that are being

1233
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,370
developed where seizures are our four

1234
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:05,510
kids

1235
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:11,839
these seizures that it's always very

1236
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:14,780
gratifying to use their approaches so we

1237
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:18,250
study how cannabinoids regulated

1238
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:22,960
seizures in different

1239
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:25,210
in different ways we confirmed and

1240
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,608
extended distance really exciting

1241
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:30,070
yourself that show that kinetic dial has

1242
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:33,069
anti-seizure properties and and we're

1243
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:34,690
finding results that show that maybe

1244
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,730
cannabidiol might not be the only

1245
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:39,909
molecule and maybe we can compliment it

1246
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:42,010
and start having this technology

1247
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:43,750
so I think this is very promising and

1248
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:45,490
it's just the beginning I think there's

1249
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:48,969
a lot of research that we can do to

1250
00:57:45,489 --> 00:57:56,098
continue optimizing that and then the

1251
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:59,108
the second area of research is cancer we

1252
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:02,140
we followed up on this episode of those

1253
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:04,420
Spaniards groups that showed that what

1254
00:58:02,139 --> 00:58:08,318
compounds can actually directly kill

1255
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:10,869
cancer cells they're not terrific for

1256
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:13,058
all cancer types but some cancers

1257
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:14,470
actually respond to the one well

1258
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:17,650
and they'd be really interesting to

1259
00:58:14,469 --> 00:58:23,019
understand why this cancer type responds

1260
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:24,970
very well the other thing that we did is

1261
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:26,889
if it's not working well for other types

1262
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:28,989
of cancer maybe we can optimize it and I

1263
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:32,739
make it better so those are the two big

1264
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:37,509
efforts that are happening particularly

1265
00:58:32,739 --> 00:58:41,318
in my lab and our goal is from American

1266
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:44,910
basic research or their concepts to move

1267
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:47,679
this forward and create a new type of

1268
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:49,659
transformative medicine the word

1269
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,078
transformative is very important it

1270
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:54,259
means that medicine

1271
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:59,239
laughs and to be treating something that

1272
00:58:54,259 --> 00:59:01,278
will actually build this isn't and I

1273
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:04,278
think that the compounds have that

1274
00:59:01,278 --> 00:59:07,548
ability to actually hit some diseases

1275
00:59:04,278 --> 00:59:09,829
that were not able to address them for

1276
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:13,190
example drove a fps

1277
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:17,180
these kids are not able to buy anything

1278
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:18,920
Ars Technica care anymore so we're doing

1279
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:22,909
this effort and we're trying to push

1280
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:25,479
this forward into clinical trials and

1281
00:59:22,909 --> 00:59:28,879
we're working with NIH very closely

1282
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:31,998
breaking with some farm up we actually

1283
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,979
started a company around this technology

1284
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:36,048
so clearly we could actually protects

1285
00:59:33,978 --> 00:59:39,439
this and roll all the way so that

1286
00:59:36,048 --> 00:59:40,940
actually was an interesting step for my

1287
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,409
career five years ago and we started

1288
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,210
this company because

1289
00:59:42,409 --> 00:59:46,849
thinking about the business aspect what

1290
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:50,059
does it mean to start a company also and

1291
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:53,269
the challenges and there's so many young

1292
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:55,400
entrepreneurs in this room and the

1293
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:56,809
challenges that we face in starting

1294
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,170
companies so I started getting really

1295
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:02,570
interested in business questions which

1296
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:05,820
is so not academic

1297
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:08,220
it was a really nice comment and I think

1298
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:10,830
that's also why I really enjoyed the

1299
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:17,269
power of this kind of community is

1300
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:19,949
because we are able to have both

1301
01:00:17,269 --> 01:00:23,039
research and and the business and

1302
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:27,210
development part talk to each other and

1303
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:29,070
try to work together and then and then I

1304
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:30,780
found what you started

1305
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:34,019
Germany

1306
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:35,730
and I always was very interested in

1307
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:38,980
legal and

1308
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:42,309
questions so I have the chance of

1309
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:45,760
healthy for high-fiber too long in other

1310
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:49,869
paths to provide some advice it and love

1311
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,150
the part where when the policymaking the

1312
01:00:49,869 --> 01:00:55,210
legislators actually reach out to

1313
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:56,740
scientists to provide some framework of

1314
01:00:55,210 --> 01:01:00,099
what are the results and how can you

1315
01:00:56,739 --> 01:01:03,219
actually shape the legal structure I

1316
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:06,608
think that's very very very strong way

1317
01:01:03,219 --> 01:01:08,679
to tour together and so I've been in

1318
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:12,219
very close touch with the University of

1319
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:15,219
Washington law school and at least law

1320
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:18,309
and policy projects because again it's

1321
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:20,559
very important that there was some

1322
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:22,719
interaction between the long end of the

1323
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,759
scientists that gave us the opportunity

1324
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,659
to actually work with the Washington

1325
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:30,880
State the current cannabis board and

1326
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:34,769
each time were able to provide some

1327
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,769
advice and maybe some help

1328
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:43,440
and then about three or four years ago

1329
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:50,039
Google leaders at the first Center

1330
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:54,778
Washington myself really decided to step

1331
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:56,039
up and try to to organize the the forces

1332
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:57,568
that we have at the University of

1333
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:00,390
Washington because we're in the middle

1334
01:01:57,568 --> 01:02:03,440
of a extraordinary big experiments

1335
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:07,528
that's happening it's our duty as

1336
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:10,108
academics to try to help and do some

1337
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:14,219
research and how that all this process

1338
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:16,469
has who as well so we formulated to be

1339
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:18,988
the idea of creating a center for

1340
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:24,978
cannabis research that would be an

1341
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:27,978
entity that would help research on a

1342
01:02:24,978 --> 01:02:27,978
camisole

1343
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:32,529
several times to Olympia and had some

1344
01:02:30,608 --> 01:02:35,170
very productive discussions with some

1345
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:37,930
senators and some matters and it is and

1346
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:40,960
so we're all trying to work together to

1347
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:42,368
try to implement this Center so that we

1348
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:50,730
can actually perform the research that

1349
01:02:42,369 --> 01:02:53,890
is really necessary in these times and

1350
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:56,409
we are building this Center which is

1351
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:58,389
currently still very virtual but what

1352
01:02:56,409 --> 01:03:01,598
we've done is we've kind of reached out

1353
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:03,338
and trying to understand who are who are

1354
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,490
the academics that are interested in

1355
01:03:03,338 --> 01:03:08,078
cannabis research of course there's

1356
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:12,229
mostella lab because we've been doing

1357
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:13,880
that for 25 years and we have escaped

1358
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:16,340
the beginning simply reached out and

1359
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:21,349
what we realized is that there were some

1360
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:23,990
who's over about fifty different very

1361
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:25,940
high quality teams of researchers at

1362
01:03:23,989 --> 01:03:29,118
University of Washington that are

1363
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:33,619
interested in cannabis related questions

1364
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:36,619
and the breadth of result of interest is

1365
01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:38,358
extraordinarily large there's the

1366
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:42,530
medical school there's the law school

1367
01:03:38,358 --> 01:03:45,259
orders for social art so many forestry

1368
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:46,940
so many actually academics that

1369
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:52,040
understand that it's part of their

1370
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:55,809
mission to study this planet and and so

1371
01:03:52,039 --> 01:04:00,559
we're very excited to mobilize all this

1372
01:03:55,809 --> 01:04:02,960
intellect and try to sound how about we

1373
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:05,840
need to think you think we need to think

1374
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:11,300
about the cannabis field as a as a as a

1375
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:14,358
continuum it's a very broad continuous

1376
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:17,570
and unfortunately currently society is

1377
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:22,009
very polarized either is the best

1378
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:24,170
or is close to the pen

1379
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:27,020
that's too far lines and I think

1380
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:30,050
Palestine that's one of the message that

1381
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:33,050
I think the scientists are trying to

1382
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:34,670
portray is that it's a continuum and

1383
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:37,370
then there's going to be specific

1384
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:41,809
questions that need to address in every

1385
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:44,690
in every the health aspect is there's a

1386
01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:48,469
toxicity profile that's associated to

1387
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:51,309
cannabis use it is clearly not good

1388
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:55,699
indication for women that are pregnant

1389
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:59,449
who's very very strong evidence that it

1390
01:04:55,699 --> 01:05:01,519
could be toxic to the embryo I believe

1391
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:08,299
that's an actually easy fixes just about

1392
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:13,909
educating people young people also very

1393
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:17,240
good that we have a system that limits

1394
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:19,519
th use the harm reduction is very

1395
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:21,429
interesting so from toxicity and now we

1396
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:24,630
have our reduction in quite actually

1397
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:27,329
substitute things

1398
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:30,269
to snow then there's tremendous benefit

1399
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:32,670
so that's at that health level at the

1400
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:38,210
industry level these are new jobs

1401
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:41,840
there's new concerns about the job

1402
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:45,230
there's toxicity associated with

1403
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:49,230
pesticides that people there's many

1404
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:53,190
questions that needs to be addressed and

1405
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:56,969
as a continued the plant itself actually

1406
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:59,550
have is so interesting there's what they

1407
01:05:56,969 --> 01:06:02,549
do hundred scientific articles on the

1408
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:05,550
biology of the cannabis plant and as

1409
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:07,560
compared to millions on the tomato we

1410
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:11,280
need research there is a potential that

1411
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:13,590
is tremendous and understanding is even

1412
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,660
it you can talk about the DNA in the

1413
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:22,260
genetics actually it has a very special

1414
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:24,710
DNA and therefore even edited of the

1415
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,270
plant participated by the from her

1416
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:29,199
[Music]

1417
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:33,130
genetics of these

1418
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:35,919
research so we've been we've reached

1419
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:37,869
outs rivers in Washington with other

1420
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,670
entities to try to synchronize our

1421
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:42,309
metrics so that we're not the only one

1422
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:43,889
so we're talking to WSU to see what

1423
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:46,180
they're doing and trying to synergize

1424
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:48,608
we're talking to other states

1425
01:06:46,179 --> 01:06:50,019
we're doing in California are starting

1426
01:06:48,608 --> 01:06:54,068
centers for cannabis research

1427
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:56,650
connections or made our efforts so we're

1428
01:06:54,068 --> 01:07:05,279
we're trying and I think it is moving

1429
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:07,690
forward and in conclusion I think I know

1430
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:11,410
what we're realizing is this world is

1431
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:13,920
changing very very wet and we're all

1432
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:18,190
very excited about this new chapter that

1433
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:20,619
you and I think by working together we

1434
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:23,220
need to be able to foster what the

1435
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:23,220
benefit of

1436
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:29,750
shelter and we need to be concerned

1437
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:36,510
about reducing all the potential

1438
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:39,619
possible pitfalls of this industry so

1439
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,619
that was my time

1440
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:58,050
and help employers so what we find in

1441
01:07:56,219 --> 01:08:00,059
this association what we will do is

1442
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:02,510
adapt very quickly to try something we

1443
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:05,009
think it's going to give added value to

1444
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:06,330
business as it helps sponsors so that's

1445
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:07,740
what we're going to do really quick then

1446
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:13,130
we're going to take questions so

1447
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:13,129
Danielle enter

1448
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:28,798
yeah did you enjoy this panel this panel

1449
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,659
is sponsored by budding recreational by

1450
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:32,908
the Federation is a unique cannot

1451
01:08:30,658 --> 01:08:36,179
experience celebrated straight mention

1452
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:38,009
Nexus of music marijuana but it's

1453
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:39,989
dedicated to bringing their customers

1454

miles

1457
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:55,770
time to picture popularly about that

1458
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,889
value added and this is the Business

1459

picture

1462
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:08,260
[Music]

1463
01:09:10,649 --> 01:09:20,889
we will do this after the next panel as

1464
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:23,019
well all right ten minutes for questions

1465
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:26,680
I will mention to you I love this

1466
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:29,170
industry I love the panels you know I do

1467
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:31,570
this because I love it and one of the

1468
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:35,640
things I love about it other than the

1469
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:38,170
brilliance is what I hear in sentences

1470
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:40,869
and groups like this all over the

1471
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:42,730
country for almost 30 years never have I

1472
01:09:40,869 --> 01:09:45,539
heard that you puncture and mash

1473
01:09:42,729 --> 01:09:45,539
situations

1474
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:58,029
okay I've got four questions over here

1475
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:59,559
we have them in that specific rating I

1476
01:09:58,029 --> 01:10:02,229
want to thank you for coming and I

1477
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:05,170
actually my question to you is that I

1478
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:07,929
would like for you to iterate then

1479
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:10,029
explain a little bit something from your

1480
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:12,940
testimony to put the LCP about home

1481
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:14,710
approach which they get connected the

1482
01:10:12,939 --> 01:10:17,049
difficulties that you've been through in

1483
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:22,300
the need for medical research with the

1484
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:23,800
viability and desirably homegrown with

1485
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:28,210
this little regulations possible a

1486
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,980
possible hey pivoted well quickly it's

1487
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:31,720
because I think until you get to have my

1488
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:34,649
words down as a lab you're not going to

1489
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,650
normalize this plan

1490
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:52,099
so I just don't know how to fight cold

1491
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:54,859
who does not respond to ICD she responds

1492
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:57,020
to high THC cannabis certain terminal

1493
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:58,819
genetic disease and why human state

1494
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,830
particularly to be completely honest I'm

1495
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:03,349
glad that Paloma is not something they

1496
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:06,159
can stand on anymore because preventing

1497
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:08,510
youth access is just reefer madness 2.0

1498
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:11,420
Vanessa's mother a child who has no

1499
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:15,079
options left other than ithc

1500
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:16,940
old plant cannabis oil I see a big

1501
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:18,199
concern in the industry that businesses

1502
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:21,439
are saying well we're keeping it away

1503
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:24,019
from kids and I have to wonder what's

1504
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:26,839
happening to the hundreds of pediatric

1505
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:29,150
cannabis patients under the age of 18

1506
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:32,750
years old that have products only

1507
01:11:29,149 --> 01:11:34,609
product 8 because they can't smoke are

1508
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:37,250
all labeled with a sticker that says not

1509
01:11:34,609 --> 01:11:39,619
for children and I think if business

1510
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:41,659
owners it is your responsibility to step

1511
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:45,590
up with service these patients I am

1512
01:11:41,659 --> 01:11:47,180
forced to educate my doctors because no

1513
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:50,750
one is doing it for me

1514
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:52,880
and I see this panel knowing suniel who

1515
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:55,399
has been instrumental in eating and

1516
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,409
active education especially around CVD

1517
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:59,988
not be the only cannabinoid and I wonder

1518
01:11:57,409 --> 01:12:02,300
if any of other illnesses are taking

1519
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:04,238
steps to address this big concern that

1520
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:09,460
it needs to become an issue that can

1521
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:14,169
is for children so I know that sound

1522
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:17,770
I found a bullet did 35 years ago did a

1523
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:21,130
study on epilepsy and the problem that

1524
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:23,110
he presents and possible for saying

1525
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:25,150
mercy on this panel too is that no one

1526
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:26,889
wanted to do clinical trials number one

1527
01:12:25,149 --> 01:12:29,229
it was illegal and then there's also

1528
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:32,828
great expense to too little trials so

1529
01:12:29,229 --> 01:12:36,308
we're kind of at a point where they're

1530
01:12:32,828 --> 01:12:40,328
starting but it you know not happening

1531
01:12:36,309 --> 01:12:47,440
fast enough realities it's criminal I

1532
01:12:40,328 --> 01:12:48,488
mean it it's criminal that just say one

1533
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:53,888
quick thing for everyone

1534
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:57,549
the FDA allows the manufacturer of our

1535
01:12:53,889 --> 01:13:00,219
most suitable THC which is THC and

1536
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:02,010
sesame seed oil and soft gelatin Council

1537
01:13:00,219 --> 01:13:05,050
which has been on the market since 1985

1538
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:08,079
it allows the manufacturers announced

1539
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:10,349
multi manufacturers of that so label it

1540
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:14,229
and that the approve label which has

1541
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:18,460
pediatric dosing guidelines for pure THC

1542
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:20,019
as FDA approved and and these are they

1543
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,710
also notice that it's an inpatient

1544
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:26,739
pediatric oncology words with vaporized

1545
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:29,618
cannabis but the FDA point I think I

1546
01:13:26,738 --> 01:13:32,289
should drive home any doubt that to the

1547
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:35,539
medical system that doesn't

1548
01:13:32,289 --> 01:13:40,969
allow or thing about THC per 480

1549
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:43,069
applications next question it's like my

1550
01:13:40,969 --> 01:13:45,199
question like what date is that uh you

1551
01:13:43,069 --> 01:13:47,059
mentioned a lot of the cosmic seed is

1552
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,920
added to treatments for children things

1553
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,840
like that and in the phonological data

1554
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,940
that you will see that CBD and I saw the

1555
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,110
central advances so because of that is

1556
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:56,719
kids that are all childhood epilepsy

1557
01:13:54,109 --> 01:13:58,369
medications CV itself quality time in

1558
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,409
the brain is how they stopping seizures

1559
01:13:58,369 --> 01:14:01,640
its inducing the blocking of the right

1560
01:14:00,409 --> 01:14:03,529
side which is making the most of the

1561
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,570
vacation already Ella so is it really

1562
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:07,219
CBD stopping caesars or CP simply

1563
01:14:05,569 --> 01:14:08,840
raising the vacation levels which are

1564
01:14:07,219 --> 01:14:10,939
then more efficient and something the

1565
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:13,130
drunk with less side effects and the

1566
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:15,289
same things that associated with cancer

1567
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:17,869
treatment or source of answers I'm gonna

1568
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:19,100
do so perhaps all this therapy is and

1569
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:21,109
not so much with McCann woods

1570
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,860
drievliet book from the action of a

1571
01:14:21,109 --> 01:14:23,859
sliver glass

1572
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:40,829
like you mentioned so if we die no there

1573
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,500
does interact on those enzymes like

1574
01:14:40,829 --> 01:14:45,600
grapefruit right needs you do have to if

1575
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,060
you're using CPT with patients who are

1576
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,670
on pharmaceutical pharmaceutical to be

1577
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:51,990
familiar with drug drug interactions

1578
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:53,699
return the CBD and other drugs and

1579
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:55,920
there's nice tables that have been

1580
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:58,349
published as a great Medscape article by

1581
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,989
pharmacist the University of Alabama

1582
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:03,750
group it's in clinical trials and see me

1583
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:05,189
whimpering or yeah or prints it on there

1584
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:07,109
too there's a whole you've gotta really

1585
01:15:05,189 --> 01:15:11,099
know the list and you got to know and

1586
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:13,369
then a doctor in Colorado I'm blanking

1587
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,690
on her name right now she's been in

1588
01:15:13,369 --> 01:15:18,420
pediatric epilepsy research

1589
01:15:15,689 --> 01:15:20,609
she's also put together a table so

1590
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:23,609
compiling a few of those tables and I'm

1591
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:25,289
happy to send those anybody else me not

1592
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:26,909
you know I think it's important to know

1593
01:15:25,289 --> 01:15:28,289
that they are cost you have to watch for

1594
01:15:26,909 --> 01:15:30,329
those high levels because those drugs

1595
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:32,699
don't have as wide a therapy window as

1596
01:15:30,329 --> 01:15:34,079
handless does so if you do get into

1597
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,909
higher levels that could impact your

1598
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:38,880
liver enzymes other things they should

1599
01:15:35,909 --> 01:15:39,949
monitor those drug levels I think it's

1600
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,060
really fun

1601
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:44,220
well I think it's really good about the

1602
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:46,289
summit is while he was asking this

1603
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:48,869
question I could see eyes lighten up all

1604
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:52,500
those numbers and the question gets

1605
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:58,079
asked and you hear what we could every

1606
01:15:52,500 --> 01:16:00,770
time like the next sound is here's what

1607
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,769
we found out

1608
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:07,719
[Applause]

1609
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:10,958
I had a question regarding the research

1610
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:13,779
that's cited a lot of really promising

1611
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:15,550
stuff is there an easy way for the

1612
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:18,158
general public to access its information

1613
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:21,309
and we start sharing on social media to

1614
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:25,138
get rid of some of his ignorance into

1615
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:28,659
the community yeah one of the big

1616
01:16:25,139 --> 01:16:30,729
horrible things about research is that

1617
01:16:28,658 --> 01:16:33,129
it's largely kept with the general

1618
01:16:30,729 --> 01:16:36,280
public through the cost of journal

1619
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:39,458
subscriptions and when I was a professor

1620
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:40,809
at Berkeley I had access I access

1621
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:43,748
everything that the University of

1622
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:45,429
California subscribe to now that not be

1623
01:16:43,748 --> 01:16:47,109
more honored access to anything unless

1624
01:16:45,429 --> 01:16:49,269
it's an open access journal which means

1625
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:51,038
that author pays for their own copyright

1626
01:16:49,269 --> 01:16:52,748
and enemy time I published something I

1627
01:16:51,038 --> 01:16:54,429
publish at open access to that to my

1628
01:16:52,748 --> 01:16:56,438
research to sports its public it's not

1629
01:16:54,429 --> 01:17:00,010
like people sitting in you know offices

1630
01:16:56,439 --> 01:17:03,219
in academia research gate I think is a

1631
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:04,958
good tool out there because to Neal is

1632
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:06,969
on there I'm on there so you could

1633
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:08,979
follow us as researchers and we upload

1634
01:17:06,969 --> 01:17:11,260
everything that we publish on to there

1635
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:13,749
so that people can download it so that's

1636
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:15,789
a really good resource the drug policy

1637
01:17:13,748 --> 01:17:17,319
Alliance for AI needs to work which is

1638
01:17:15,788 --> 01:17:20,078
destruct all Sea Org

1639
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:23,698
has a really good repository library on

1640
01:17:20,078 --> 01:17:27,728
their website as well that has a ton of

1641
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:29,708
articles that you can access but it is a

1642
01:17:27,729 --> 01:17:31,958
big issue I mean the the ability of the

1643
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:36,389
general public to access the academic

1644
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:36,389
literature is a huge issue

1645
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:42,938
Thursday there's a gap these scientific

1646
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,769
papers are really heavy and hard to be

1647
01:17:42,939 --> 01:17:48,150
you don't want to be spending your time

1648
01:17:44,769 --> 01:17:51,039
and really focus what we needed mean

1649
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:53,498
it's a solution is to there's actually a

1650
01:17:51,038 --> 01:17:56,228
website on University of Washington the

1651
01:17:53,498 --> 01:17:58,300
avai website where you have scientists

1652
01:17:56,229 --> 01:18:00,099
that actually read the literature and

1653
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:02,229
then summarize it and it says there's

1654
01:18:00,099 --> 01:18:05,078
what what we're trying to implement as a

1655
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:08,019
website where your questions you can go

1656
01:18:05,078 --> 01:18:10,658
and sit so what is the deal about can

1657
01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:12,400
have died and anxiety and you would have

1658
01:18:10,658 --> 01:18:13,719
an airman you have an area where you can

1659
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:15,759
actually play and say these are the

1660
01:18:13,719 --> 01:18:18,158
strongest results and this is what it's

1661
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,650
done so we need to be some kind of

1662
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:23,438
filtering and I think that's our job as

1663
01:18:20,649 --> 01:18:25,448
academics is to gather because there's

1664
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:28,110
so many papers and some are not to the

1665
01:18:25,448 --> 01:18:32,938
same quantity so you even first level of

1666
01:18:28,109 --> 01:18:32,938
filtering that's what we're trying to

1667
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:39,849
present the specialist criticism in the

1668
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:42,819
case of some earlier you were talking

1669
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:45,519
about how getting high dosages of whole

1670
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:47,590
plant CBD to patients is very expensive

1671
01:18:45,519 --> 01:18:49,418
and we know that and I'm a whole plant

1672
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:52,719
guy and I'm not a big fan of iceland's

1673
01:18:49,418 --> 01:18:56,198
except it does seem to be appropriate to

1674
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:59,708
spike patients medicine that's already

1675
01:18:56,198 --> 01:19:02,678
whole plant with CP isolate to just at

1676
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:04,809
that aspect wake up with in the bed of

1677
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:09,149
the rest of the cannabinoid profile 29

1678
01:19:04,809 --> 01:19:09,150
sounds good we should fry

1679
01:19:09,448 --> 01:19:15,698
gg-get again high-seat I'm all about

1680
01:19:12,698 --> 01:19:17,399
clinical safety and efficacy and if you

1681
01:19:15,698 --> 01:19:19,448
have the risk benefit ratio is

1682
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:21,488
appropriate that you should do it I mean

1683
01:19:19,448 --> 01:19:24,009
this this is how a lot of these things

1684
01:19:21,488 --> 01:19:26,829
are being done we have to practice this

1685
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:29,710
is a new frontier I try to use the

1686
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:31,960
latest studies that I can find to inform

1687
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:34,029
the reason of the treatment that I'm

1688
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,619
doing and you can track patients that's

1689
01:19:34,029 --> 01:19:38,170
a whole punitive clinical observation

1690
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:40,510
that's how cannabis and medicine was you

1691
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:42,819
know described 150 years ago in Western

1692
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:44,140
medicine it was people just don't sing

1693
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:46,179
it on subjects like well she's really

1694
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:47,800
much on the CD or her doctor Richard

1695
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:49,600
Reynolds or so labels that they were

1696
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,190
just doing this kind of well I've got

1697
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,690
this teacher let's see what happens in

1698
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:55,238
the magnets okay they went away that's

1699
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:57,279
how much did I use so because I got

1700
01:19:55,238 --> 01:19:59,319
really good safety information I would

1701
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:01,059
be happy that as long as that crystal

1702
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:03,698
CBD is coming from a reliable source

1703
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:07,120
that you know it's you know clean and

1704
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:08,799
free of any toxins you can you could

1705
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:10,269
definitely dose that way and I think

1706
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,579
there's a lot of research that suggests

1707
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:14,640
that whole plant CBD the synergistic

1708
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:17,229
effect of that is stronger than the

1709
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:19,090
single chemical so if you're going to do

1710
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:21,009
that that makes sense but it would be

1711
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:22,360
really nice to get more see the whole

1712
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:24,969
plant available the shops

1713
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:27,880
I do think anyone that can grow should

1714
01:20:24,969 --> 01:20:30,219
grow I have all my patients who you know

1715
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,920
or interest in that at least to maximize

1716
01:20:30,219 --> 01:20:33,219
that plant count so they can trial and

1717
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,869
error

1718
01:20:33,219 --> 01:20:38,439
like Kevin Jody was talking about

1719
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:41,579
earlier next we have it's short for

1720
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:41,579
thank you first of all
