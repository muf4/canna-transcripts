that we mostly know as rso

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,600

21
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,439
to see you all right so um so let's

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,119
start at the top man um you know when

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,439
when we first started talking about it a

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,320
few years ago the reason it came up was

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,640
because you said um you know

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,079
long time cannabis guy but that you had

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,478
come across a particular rso that like

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,200
was a total game changer for you and

29
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,959
caused you to like go down this new path

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
so why don't we start there tell me tell

31
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,919
me about like this first time you had an

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,319
rso that told you that oh man i can use

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,079
this to treat my line

34
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,279
well

35
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,118
you know the first time was kind of the

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,439
story i told you about

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,280
going to a dispensary and all that and

38
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,158
raw juicing cbd

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,599
and

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,320
i never believed in

41
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,519
marijuana as as medicine per se but

42
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,438
after i got

43
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,840
bit by the tick and landed and i was in

44
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,279
icu for a month i was four years ago in

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,560
kentucky

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,000
they had up me on so many medications

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
that

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,680
at one point i was up to 71 medications

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,399
a day and even if one of them worked how

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,399
would you really know on that level

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,640
which wasn't the cross contaminations of

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,239
stuff and i explained to you inside like

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,359
when i first got sick four years ago i

54
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,679
believed

55
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,118
in doctors and in hospitals that you get

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
sick and that they're gonna treat you

57
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,598
but i was the first case of hwasong

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,840
virus meningococcal encephalitis

59
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,519
infection kentucky had ever seen i was a

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,959
75th case since 1908

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,159
and i was the first one to live through

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,239
it so they they didn't know what to do

63
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,159
and they experimented on me and in

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,920
kentucky there was no medical cannabis

65
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,799
so they would put me on prescription

66
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:32,719
drop and all you know there was 400 for

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,719
10 pills of synthetic thc

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,800
i'm on

69
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,318
all that medicine and

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,480
you know the seizures started hardcore

71
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,560
after all the iv antibiotics from you

72
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,679
know i was in the hospital of june and

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,199
then they had me going back to the

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,959
hospital all july for iv rocephin and

75
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,878
when that stopped

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,640
this seizure started and i'd never had

77
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,639
cedars before

78
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,199
i had uh

79
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,359
read some information about cbd oil and

80
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,839
i'd read some information about

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,440
this rick simpson oil stuff that and

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,719
i've been in cannabis my whole life but

83
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,000
i never really believed in medical

84
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,318
cannabis so

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,280
we come up to michigan to a dispensary

86
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,280
not a friend with medical card

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,680
and i remember every

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,280
part of this story with with my brain

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,120
injury the way it is but this was so

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
remarkable to me

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,599
that we we drove all the way up here we

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,840
got here at night we went to the

93
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,039
dispensary i couldn't go in because i

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,039
couldn't go into the back because i

95
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,719
didn't have a medical card but i said in

96
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,798
the front and they had a raw juice bar

97
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,799
and had cbd

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,319
that they would add to the raw juice

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,040
now that was my first experience ever

100
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:45,119
with cbd now at the time i shook

101
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,840
uncontrollably

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,480
i almost have an ms um

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
and i had light phobia which i still

104
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,479
have but not but not to that extent that

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,239
even at night watching tv i'd have to

106
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,479
wear sunglasses because from

107
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,120
encephalitis and meningitis light would

108
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,878
would burn

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
this lady gave me a raw juice cannabis

110
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,560
shot while we're sitting there so just

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,280
micro greens with some cbd and

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,039
i took it and a couple seconds later

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
shannon reached over and touched my

114
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,079
elbow like this and she said you're not

115
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,079
shaking

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,358
and when she said that i lowered my

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,680
sunglasses to look at my hands

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,918
and i wasn't shaking and the light

119
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
caught my eyes and it wasn't burning my

120
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,758
eyes

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
that was the exact moment when i'm like

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,280
oh

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,040
cannabis is medicine i

124
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,959
for for being in this for years and

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,479
never truly believing that cannabis was

126
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,719
medicine i explained this to you earlier

127
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,879
like you smoke a joint like to lower

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
stress or i believe

129
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,478
cancer patients smoked marijuana or

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,600
something that gave them appetite

131
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,680
so

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,080
uh he gets me some rso there it happened

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,040
to be bubba kush rso

134
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,639
well

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,879
one of the big issues with me was

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,720
sleeping you know you're in so much pain

137
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,959
you're hurting you're vomiting around

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,720
the clock you're having seizures

139
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:09,519
i introduced this um you know just a

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,280
0.1 milligrams of rso in the beginning

141
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,439
just like a little dot on the side of

142
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,758
the plastic capsule

143
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,918
[ __ ] i slept for 12 straight hours and

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,319
if you sleep you hear it allows the

145
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,319
antibiotics which i do believe in

146
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,959
to actually do their job and start to

147
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,399
let me heal and i was sleeping so much

148
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,038
in recovery

149
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,198
but oh i skipped over a very vital thing

150
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,918
there i told you this earlier inside

151
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,160
that after we did the raw juice shot

152
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,478
i'd lost 80 pounds

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,439
we left the dispensary i went to a pizza

154
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,199
place

155
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,879
and ate half half three quarters of a

156
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,879
pizza and hadn't done that since i got

157
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,199
sick and i'm like okay

158
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,719
i'm not shaking my eyes aren't hurting

159
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,800
and i just got appetite and that was

160
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,639
just from cbd

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
and then the bubba kush was the first

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
start that actually

163
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,079
uh it gave me sleep

164
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,399
um

165
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,478
and it gave me pain control that indica

166
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,758
and everything and

167
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,519
i was just

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,560
consumed with this well i'm in kentucky

169
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,879
and

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,399
i have seven felonies from growing in

171
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,478
2003.

172
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,599
in kentucky i have a grandma or so as a

173
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,560
fellow

174
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
so

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,280
you know i'm very adamant you know how i

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,360
am i talk about what i believe in and i

177
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,038
trained police dogs for

178
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
15 years so that kind of made it

179
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:27,918
difficult and uh

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,919
um

181
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,599
you know uh uh there was a politician

182
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,599
matt daley and the secretary of state in

183
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
kentucky alice in london grimes they

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,199
wanted to push medical cannabis four

185
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,800
years ago for the kentucky patients so

186
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,639
they used my story

187
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,038
and they made me uh kind of the face of

188
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,079
that and i fought for it in kentucky and

189
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,439
when it failed i'd kind of out of myself

190
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,918
you know again and

191
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,519
i moved instantly to michigan

192
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,038
so that i could

193
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,799
access our ssr so and be able to access

194
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,800
even then i'm looking at strain

195
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
specifics i smoke a joint of bubba kush

196
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,079
i feel a certain type of way i smoke a

197
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,318
joint a kosher kush i feel a certain

198
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,000
type of way different strains do

199
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,080
different things

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,879
kosher kush you can give me that joint

201
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,839
blind in a bowl of joints and if i smoke

202
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,439
kosher kush i'm eating in 30 minutes

203
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,119
there's not there's there's a handful of

204
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,759
strings that actually do that to me give

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,959
me an appetite

206
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,639
so

207
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,079
moving up to michigan it was about

208
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
i need to grow as many different strands

209
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,279
i can cook them all down to see which

210
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,160
ones are working the best for my

211
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,679
individual needs at individual times

212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,280
and that's what all research went to

213
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,918
and i moved up here

214
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,198
uh three and a half years ago

215
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:45,120
and

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,520
one day i'm sitting uh i'm in my grow

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
room and i'm alone i mean i'm i'm born

218
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,120
and raised kentucky

219
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,800
um all my friends and family there i was

220
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,038
very lonely up here shannon had to stay

221
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,319
at our dog kennel in kentucky because we

222
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,680
had a lot of farm animals we couldn't

223
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,000
just up move everything um

224
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,959
so i listen to podcasts around the clock

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,199
and

226
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,680
you know i'm trying to learn

227
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,680
how to grow again to the level that i'm

228
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,840
doing and i'm trying to go into organics

229
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
not synthetics which i've done for my

230
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,758
whole life

231
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,680
and i came across you and i didn't know

232
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,038
you from adam and

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,800
that the particular podcast was uh

234
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,680
you and me and gene from

235
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,240
mendocino talking about

236
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
powdery mildew resistant strains

237
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,958
and then i go

238
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,158
i i delve down the hole more because i'm

239
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,838
um

240
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,679
i've got youtube there so i'm listening

241
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,039
to it non-stop you know and i'm i'm

242
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,519
listening different grow videos and you

243
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,879
find some very amateurish grow videos

244
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,839
and then when you find something that is

245
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,639
professional i'm like this kevin jones

246
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,560
or

247
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,799
you and then you're interviewing this

248
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,879
kevin jodrey guy and i started listening

249
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,639
to this kevin joder god i'm like the

250
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,720
smartest dude i've ever heard talk about

251
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,199
anything period and

252
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
you're out there uh like to take you

253
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,800
mentally back this is when you were like

254
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,039
doing your podcast like green bicycles

255
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,559
and some with kevin jones are you doing

256
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,039
those little segments where you do like

257
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,559
ten segments yeah the live session

258
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,719
yeah and

259
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,879
i listened to every one of the breeders

260
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,560
series that kevin jodrey did yeah that

261
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,639
was the first thing i sponsored really

262
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,039
yeah do you know that i grew seeds from

263
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,679
every single guy in that breeders series

264
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,679
oh that's awesome

265
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,360
well some of them are actually like

266
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,959
friends friends talk to on the phone

267
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,680
multiple times a week and things like

268
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,000
that

269
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,399
that changed my life like your podcast

270
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
that that well anyway let me scale back

271
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,039
so

272
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
jackson is talking about

273
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,039
the mean gene from mendocino was talking

274
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,040
about powdery mildew resistant strains

275
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,360
and i'm looking at this from a sick

276
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,838
person that got

277
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,800
lyme disease and meningitis poison

278
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,800
disease uh meningitis

279
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,399
babisia bartonella uh rocky mountains uh

280
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,799
rocky mountains uh

281
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,278
fever spotted tick fever ricketts uh

282
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,359
obesity bartonella just all this [ __ ]

283
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,919
from a tick and

284
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,079
that's all parasite that's all

285
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,799
stuff that is hosting and feeding off of

286
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,078
me

287
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,559
and i start researching the powdery

288
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,199
mildew and the powdery mildew

289
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,000
goes down and it

290
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,920
spores and it is sinking like an anchor

291
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
through through the meristem of the

292
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,838
plant and then anchoring in and hosting

293
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
off and then feeding

294
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,920
and i'm thinking wow if this plant is

295
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,320
powdery mildew resistant that means it's

296
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,240
resistant to this pathogen that if i

297
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,120
take plants

298
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,278
into rso that are like that

299
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,159
that that will help my condition more

300
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,799
because i'm battling parasitic infection

301
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,958
so you're making a a corollary that if

302
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,958
the plant can defend itself from powdery

303
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,199
mildew maybe it'll help you defend

304
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,799
yourself from the parasites because it's

305
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
defending itself from a parasite trying

306
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,958
to host off of it i've already got them

307
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,480
in me so

308
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,319
so i'm listening all these podcasts and

309
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
listen to all this [ __ ] i'm up in

310
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,879

502
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,160
resistance of rule seven and for you all

503
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,640
that never ran roll seven i have seen a

504
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,519
plant with bud rot and coated in

505
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,559
powdered mildew laying on the roll seven

506
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,759
and not a drop of it on

507
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,759
we had

508
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,000
in michigan this is i started growing in

509
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,079
1995 when i was 15. this is the wettest

510
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,880
year that i've ever grew it this year is

511
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,279
this year hands down i had more bud rot

512
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,160
than i ever dealt with this year and

513
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,440
even my neighbor who farms 3 000 acres

514
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,519
of corn around here said this the

515
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,798
wettest winter ever for him on corn

516
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,038
they've been having to cook their corn

517
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,879
off in ovens at night to keep the molds

518
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,679
and everything down

519
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,280
and the rule seven here not a drop not a

520
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,480
drop not

521
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,038
i mean

522
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,120
it's amazing what that plant can do so

523
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,119
you look at that did every that other

524
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,879
plants beside are dropping off and it's

525
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,639
still hardy that's what you're looking

526
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,080
for to to fix yourself when you're

527
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,640
dealing with the same things you're

528
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,678
doing the same parasitic infections

529
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,600
um

530
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,280
now i've tried to experiment and because

531
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,480
i know there's 10 000 other strains out

532
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,798
there i can find

533
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,319
but i screw myself up every time i go

534
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,119
off roll seven

535
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,960
and it's rule seven in particular that

536
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,038
that particular cut

537
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,120
so it's more than just the awesome in

538
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,440
the narrow there's something else in the

539
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,279
mix in the royal seven and you're still

540
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
trying to figure out what that is yeah

541
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,200
and because it doesn't always transfer

542
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,519
so there's another keep on talking yeah

543
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,000
there's another plant uh

544
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,119
hollywood pure kush

545
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,480
that

546
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:15,038
so i i i say i have two mentors in this

547
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,960
game now i don't think they call me

548
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,640
their mentoree and they have no choice

549
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
on me calling their mentors but that's

550
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,320
kevin gildery and mean jean from

551
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,240
mendocino i i love them unequivocally uh

552
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,240
they've just helped me so much through

553
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,839
through this journey and

554
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,519
um

555
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,439
you know it's not just

556
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,759
there are multiple plants out there

557
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,400
that'll help you and i hear kevin tell

558
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,160
the story through a

559
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,720
podcast maybe it was yours i can't

560
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,558
remember but it was about a guy that had

561
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,519
this disease where

562
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,918
he hiccuped non-stop you know now it

563
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,519
started off that he was at a dispensary

564
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,200
you know they were closing up shop it

565
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,558
was the end of the day somebody pulled

566
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,880
in there in a wheelchair or something

567
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,160
like that and kevin sold him some of his

568
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
personal smoke because they had already

569
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
shut down his hollywood pure kush guy

570
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,919
came back the next day and was like yo

571
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,759
that's the best i've felt and forever

572
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,880
with my spasticity and shaking and

573
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,798
things

574
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,559
and kevin gave me some more and then

575
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,079
another other couple people tried it and

576
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,079
the same work for them

577
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,199
etc etc

578
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,038
so

579
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,640
when me and you really linked up was the

580
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,798
michigan regenerative conference up here

581
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,720
three years ago and kevin's telling the

582
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,200
story at this point me and kevin have a

583
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,480
slight relationship um

584
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,640
just because i've flown out to

585
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,720
california and tracked him down and i

586
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,679
think he respected that like this dude

587
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,798
ain't just saying he's trying to get

588
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,759
better he's put into work and uh i

589
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,079
literally followed him around the

590
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,240
emerald cup for an hour for an hour

591
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,759
didn't have the nerve to say anything to

592
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,919
him and finally he turned around was

593
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,798
like yo man can i help you yeah

594
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
uh

595
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,839
i pulled my shirt and i was like i got a

596
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,599
port and instantly like uh i'm sick your

597
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,279
video helped me here's all the research

598
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,399
my doctors and nurses here they'd like

599
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,399
to talk to you you know and uh

600
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,840
so kevin tells a story about hollywood

601
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,038
pure kush and then this guy

602
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,038
that uh

603
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,720
hiccuped non-stop

604
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,400
i mean to where a business guy where he

605
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,679
couldn't even hold a conversation where

606
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,320
he'd have to drink something make

607
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
himself vomit and then he had like a 15

608
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,439
minutes and no hiccups you know or

609
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,038
something like that if i'm botching the

610
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,880
story i apologize

611
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,079
and when he tried the hollywood thrill

612
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,919
push it fixed that for him so

613
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,439
you know i get a hold of kevin

614
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,679
i get the hollywood pure kush i go out

615
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,360
to california i get it uh fly back on

616
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,440
and i'm sure some people seen the

617
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,599
pictures i flew right with it on on the

618
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
plane because it mattered like that and

619
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,519
i was dying

620
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,200
that [ __ ] helped with my shaking a lot

621
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,319
um but when i tried to breed the

622
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,400
hollywood pure kush even into the royal

623
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,918
to try to find either one of those

624
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,960
things together like the best of both

625
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,679
worlds i lost it both you know um

626
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,159
because i take royal 7r so

627
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,080
and i'm going to hurx and buy hurts the

628
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,440
easiest way is to show like i have

629
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:01,678
babisia so i take rule 7 rso

630
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,000
and then it's gonna it's gonna like that

631
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,400
is herxing this rash and everything it's

632
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,119
killing off the parasites inside

633
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,480
then i have to flush the parasites out

634
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,918
of me yo and that's the j herxheimer

635
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,159
reaction

636
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,000
um there's these micro parasites and

637
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,760
bacteria and everything inside of you

638
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you kill them off

639
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,558
if you don't get them out of you

640
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,720
the doctor in in dc explain to me like

641
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,319
when a mouse dies in your house like in

642
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,240
a cabinet

643
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,639
it kind of like rots and it'll discolor

644
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,798
the wood and it'll stink in like ammonia

645
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,120
and all these chemicals come off of the

646
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,119
mouse

647
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,038
so

648
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,360
the parasites and stuff inside you kill

649
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,038
them off if you don't flush them out and

650
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:48,079
they are releasing chemicals and stuff

651
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,919
inside of you they're like polluting you

652
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,759
and they're making you hurt they're

653
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,720
increasing your inflammation

654
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:57,200
your joint pressure uh the bacteria the

655
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,558
lyme disease bacteria uh

656
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,279
likes to attack soft tissue eyes brain

657
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,119
testicles kneecaps ankles you know like

658
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,440
where there's a lot of fluid in that

659
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,719
area

660
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,640
so

661
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
and with my brain injury sometimes like

662
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,640
like i'm gonna lose myself like what we

663
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,919
were even talking about here but um

664
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
uh

665
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,880
i have no clue what we were talking

666

ancient minerals ancient salts are a

674
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,599
little bit better than just regular

00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,480
epsom salts at cvs

676
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,199

hyperbaric chamber has been a game

701
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,038
changer for me an absolute game changer

702
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,159
uh the lyme disease called a

703
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,158
caused

704
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,600
and when i say lyme disease and all of

705
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,039
you always say this with me with lyme

706
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,719
disease my lyme disease is probably in

707
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,960
remission it's all the other parasites

708
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,440

uh

711
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,159
so it's sometimes trying to figure out

712
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,120

713
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,000

um

715
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
but everybody always tries to send me

716
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,440
information about lyme disease and i get

717
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,360
that people are trying to help and i

718
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,120
don't mean this rude i mean like

719
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,439
it's not about the lyme disease it's

720
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,278
what the parasites did while they were

721
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,278
tunneling around my body and tunneling

722
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,679
in and out of muscles and corkscrewing

723
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,599
into bones and going so we can have it

724
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,840
everywhere and everything

725
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:27,359
that caused

726
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:31,839
my eating bar my my stiff man's syndrome

727
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:34,319

728
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,038
my neurological conditions all these

729
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,558
weird diseases i have now that

730
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,558
all come from that

731
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,960
um like even for me to be sitting out

732
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,119
here to do this interview

733
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,240
one of my biggest issues is temperature

734
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,119
regulation

735
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,798
so

736
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,599
we just shift temperature in michigan

737
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:54,079
like four or five days ago i have on

738
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,079
two sweatshirts two t-shirts two pairs

739
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,839

jacket shout out adam dunn this is my

741
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,720
favorite jacket in the world uh made out

00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,038
of him

743

it's rated down to negative five degrees

744
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:08,158
but it's also heavy and i need that

745
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,640
weight and stuff for me

746
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,919
it's a constant game of staying ahead of

747
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,679
it

748
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,759
but what it did to me more than anything

749
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,720
was retail on me mental

750
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,359
parasites running through my brain um

751
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,278
the aggression the rage you all can

752
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,599
google this if you wanted to like there

753
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,159
is a symptom called lyme rage i am the

754
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,959
poster child for lyme rage i wasn't this

755
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,960
way

756
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,240
before i got bit by a tick

757
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,880
my job was to train the most

758
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,839
highly protective aggressive and working

759
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,000
line

760
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,158
german shepherds and milos to cap that

761
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
aggression control that self to work

762
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,559
through it

763
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,600
and to do all this through operant

764
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,759
conditioning through skinnerism and

765
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,918
theories of dog training that wasn't

766
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,759
based off force was based off teaching

767
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,679
and learning and understanding

768
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,759
and then all of a sudden these parasites

769
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,000
wreaking havoc through me and i couldn't

770
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,038
apply the own [ __ ] that i've always done

771
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,558
yeah

772
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,278
um

773
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,678
and it's been about a constant battle

774
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,159
you know uh this summer alone um i think

775
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,080
i had 11 surgery since june from brain

776
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,240
all the way down into the tumor removals

777
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,278
you know that is has been caused by lyme

778
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,519
disease

779
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,960
so keeping control the mental illness

780
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:22,798
and we've talked about this and i'm very

781
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,798
open about this you said even inside

782
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,558
like your post on social media have

783
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,440
really changed in the last five months

784
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,119
um

785
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,399
you're clearly you're clearly more

786
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,398
upbeat in the last six months

787
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,880
it's funny when they tell you you're

788
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,119
gonna die

789
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,278
you do everything to not die i mean you

790
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,278
always know it but but once they lay it

791
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,000
down for you and you're like not not

792
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,640
today you know not today and i went

793
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,240
through too much hell um and it's not

794
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,840
just me i'm not special there are

795
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,960
a half a million of us lyme disease

796
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:57,359
patients i mean yes i'm i'm i'm weird in

797
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,960
my pawason story but there are so many

798
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,158
of us with lyme disease and so many

799
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,079
people undiagnosed and i would that was

800
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,080
the whole purpose of us doing this to

801
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,678
teach people how to

802
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:08,879
try to help themselves when doctors

803
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,960
won't help you

804
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,760
um all right we're back after a little

805
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,759
break there so um so i want to finish up

806
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,079
with this nick because so far you've

807
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,158
been pretty clear about um you know how

808
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,558
you decided that you

809
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,278
wanted to start focusing on using rso

810
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,398
for your lime support and then and then

811
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:31,278
you're chasing the royal uh kush and

812
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,798
then and then realizing that there's so

813
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:34,720
much about that plant that's helping

814
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,319
your lyme disease and then you then you

815
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,679
started to go into some of the other

816
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,960
things that you were doing too right

817
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,480
because i think you've laid out the

818
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,038
cannabis stuff pretty well that we

819
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,919
wanted to get out but i know that you

820
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,440
really believe in the synergistic

821
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,840
combination

822
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,399
of the cannabis for your endocannabinoid

823
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:56,398
system with all of these other

824
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:58,639
traditional um like folk medicines

825
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,319
that you really believe are working with

826
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,240
the cannabis to better your

827
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,480
endocannabinoid system and then like all

828
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,919
of you in fighting the lyme disease so i

829
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,159
figure since we're here we should go

830
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,480
beyond just cannabis and talk about

831
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,760

886
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,120
through my my brain and

887
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,759
that stuff has helped me

888
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,278
tremendously i mean it's it's brought me

889
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,879
back i mean if i

890
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,480
uh

891
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,679
if if i had a seizure right now the

892
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,440
first thing shannon's doing is bringing

893
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,600
me turkey tail and chaga tinctures and

894
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,960
then um

895
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,119
cbd and

896
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,360
and all that other stuff yeah

897
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,879
and let's not and i say this to the

898
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,359
marijuana community

899
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,440
let's not downplay cbd you know just

900
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,038
because hemp

901
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,600
we kind of looked at

902
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:50,240
him as our ugly cousin and and the hemp

903
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,480
industry and and all and cbd flooding

904
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,640
the market because it was

905
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,480
and excuse my language but [ __ ] cbd

906
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,559
sold in gas stations to people who were

907
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,200
sick and couldn't afford it and this

908
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,480
goes out to everybody 500 milligrams of

909
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,880
cbd should not cost 69.95 you know

910
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,960
most people and i believe the cbd is is

911
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,519
misdosed people are taking way too

912
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,200
little i take 500 milligrams cbd a day

913
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,200
that's and i have went through this

914
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
stuff to find what levels like actually

915
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,360
help after all these seizures and i can

916
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,519
experiment because i go through it you

917
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,479
know taking a tincture of 13 milligram

918
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,278
cbd a day is is just not doing it for me

919
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,038
now

920
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,480
that doesn't mean that you

921
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,798
and your particular

922
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,880
cannabinoid system that 13 milligrams

923
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:35,119
wouldn't be enough of cbd to to bring

924
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,960
that back down we're all individuals

925
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,959
that's what doctors can't seem to figure

926
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,000
out about dosing this stuff

927
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,480
is

928
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,919
it's individual cannabinoid systems i

929
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,480
know people

930
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,240
who years later like i don't get high i

931
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
mean i just don't um

932
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,839
but you look at snoop dogg who've been

933
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,919
smoking all this weed for years he's in

934
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,079
a video and he's all like how the hell's

935
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,440
he still you know his cannabinoid system

936
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,839
is different he's also not taking three

937
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,360
to four grams or so a day

938
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,918
which um

939
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,240
i would like to increases your tolerance

940
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,919
but even before i was doing rso i always

941
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,519
smoked like crazy when i was dog

942
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,559
training and i just didn't get a buzz

943
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,798
like that

944
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,558
and i know dr ethan russo and different

945
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,558
people talk about taking you know breaks

946
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,720
and and resetting the endocannabinoid

947
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,639
system in my situation i almost can't i

948
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,079
do skip rso about

949
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,080
once every two weeks or something to

950
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,678
help it be more effective because like

951
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,439
any medication the more you take it you

952
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,080
build up tolerance i take three to four

953
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,480
grams of r so every day

954
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,319
that is scary to somebody out there that

955
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,200
is hearing me say that it takes one

956
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,119
single drop and feels drugged up yeah

957
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,880
you have to tighter that up to any

958
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,639
patient out there that's ever doing this

959
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,159
you know you take a drop and then the

960
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,759
next week you take two drops and then

961
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,120
the next week you take four drops and

962
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,200
then you double it you double that you

963
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,879
double that you don't let and yes and

964
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,200
and i agree for people who have never

965
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,480
that aren't a cannabis user you know

966
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,000
um

967
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,159
and then you have to

968
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,519
give your grandmother rso

969
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,960
and she's never had this before and

970
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,120
she's sleeping 18 hours a day she's like

971
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,120
i hate this i don't like this feeling

972
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,639
for somebody who's never you know had

973
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,359
marijuana

974
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,200
in

975
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,118
you know

976
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,039
drunkenness is almost what i call it

977
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,480
because this is different than smoking

978
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,239
or something it's like edibles times a

979
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,599
billion right

980
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,598
you have to remember the medical

981
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,599
benefits that you are getting it is okay

982
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,200
to sleep you need to recover if you're

983
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,919
going through chemo if you're going

984
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,319
through whatever whatever you need to

985
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,799
sleep and recover your body will adjust

986
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,599
to it it is scary in the beginning it

987
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,280
will get better

988
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,879
it is no different than the first time

989
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,040
doctors give you a lower tab or a pain

990
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,398
pill like you're really drugged up from

991
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,800
but you start taking them and they lose

992
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:45,039
their efficiency you will build up on

993
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,960
the rso and i know it's scary in the

994
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,719
beginning i i've had a lot of patients

995
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,000
talk to me that have never been candid

996
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,559
shoes like i really don't like the

997
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,239
feeling power through it gets better you

998
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,759
know for me i love the feeling you know

999
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,319
for cannabis users they don't understand

1000
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,720
that they love the feeling but

1001
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,039
rso can be

1002
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,039
hard when you're already sick and now

1003
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,320
you're kind of like if you never took

1004
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,159
our so it's almost like doing a mushroom

1005
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,200
tree yeah you know it's very very

1006
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,440
psychedelic you know um power through

1007
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,039
be prepared it's okay

1008
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,358
um

1009
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,320
have food on hand when you start this

1010
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:19,679
stuff

1011
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,599
um

1012
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,759
and i know that in some places this is

1013
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,240
still a negative taboo marijuana is

1014
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,040
medicine but that we're losing that

1015
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:32,399
number we're way bigger on states that

1016
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,400
are than not um

1017
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:38,159
i would tell you um um to research how

1018
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,559
to make it that's all i can i can tell

1019
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,679
you i i told shango a story inside of

1020
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,759
the first time that i made my own r so i

1021
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,838
cooked down a quarter pound i paid 800

1022
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,280
for this and i cried when i was cooking

1023
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,519
it down because i was so scared i was

1024
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,440
gonna ruin all this material and at the

1025
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,679
time i'm having doctors so many checks

1026
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,119
to stay alive and i'm in kentucky not

1027
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,519
growing

1028
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,599
a quarter pound of marijuana is nothing

1029
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,400
to me now it was

1030
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,880
everything to me and and sometimes

1031
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,680
growers

1032
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,200
and

1033
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,319
producers and processors need to

1034
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,439
remember this quarter pound ain't

1035
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,760
nothing else it's everything to somebody

1036
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,519
in a one-bedroom apartment partiallying

1037
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,280
out a check just to pay for their

1038
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,358
medicine and they're disabled be

1039
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,400
compassionate caregivers take care of

1040
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:27,279
sick people you know

1041
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,599
but it is very scary when you do it but

1042
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,640
but it will work out it is a very simple

1043
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,280
process um

1044
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,799
people can help you through that process

1045
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,960
look at the videos when you are

1046
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,160
researching this on youtube i learned

1047
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,480
the hard way like you've been trying to

1048
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,399
find you all the goofy videos and i'm

1049
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,400
not at least people are trying and

1050
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,039
putting out content but but look at it

1051
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,800
all all instructions are not the same

1052
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,079
not even close

1053
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,680
and

1054
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,200
look at information look at how many

1055
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,039
people have liked it look at how many

1056
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,919
subscribers they have

1057
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,519
um

1058
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,119
because you have to become your own

1059
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,559
healer because the medical system will

1060
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,000
forget you

1061
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,358
if you don't fit into their cookie

1062
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,440
cutter approach

1063
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,880
then they'll forget you and

1064
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,000
and at that point you you've got to

1065
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
remember yourself and you've got to

1066
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,079
fight for yourself

1067
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,559
and it's very empowering

1068
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,800
to be run here

1069
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,960
it's very empowering that doctors still

1070
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,480
to this day don't understand why i still

1071
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,079
keep staying alive even though i

1072
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,159
constantly am having all these surgeries

1073
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,519
and all these issues it's the rso it's

1074
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,879
the mushrooms

1075
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,079
um

1076
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,240
and it's the willingness to keep

1077
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,839
researching to try to find some

1078
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,679
semblance of my old life

1079
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:40,078
uh and it's uh

1080
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,919
i just implore there's so many growers

1081
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,640
and breeders out there look at your

1082
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,720
powdered mildew resistant lines um

1083
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,838
look at your medical lines look at your

1084
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,598
super strong stony lines we look at that

1085
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,679
as whoa we got really stoned off this

1086
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,240
but you concentrate that down that may

1087
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,519
be the lifesaver for somebody who's

1088
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,399
battling

1089
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,480
chemo and needs to sleep or

1090
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,760
you know strong like that it's amazing

1091
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,440
how many of our thc wreck growers like

1092
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,280
who've just been like growing for you

1093
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,079
know for smoke for years

1094
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,400
don't even have a lot of basis in the

1095
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,160
medical side too like like like flower

1096
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,800
growers who don't know how to make rso

1097
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,159
right yeah correct and it is a

1098
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,000
um and i believe it's something

1099
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,358
everybody needs to have in their their

1100
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,358
tool set rso is an antibiotic

1101
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,598
and that's something that we can make at

1102
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,039
home um

1103
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,480
and it's just having the research out

1104
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,639
there i mean i've done all my research

1105
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,240
but i was talking to you inside that i

1106
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,799
would still like to learn more the

1107
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,118
terpenes are the carrier for healing and

1108
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,960
a lot of my rso we're baking it off

1109
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,760
we're stripping it down with alcohol i'm

1110
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,599
losing all my terpenes i mean our house

1111
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,160
smells great though yeah

1112
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,599
so i've got i seal it in jars and put it

1113
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,078
in the oven and you can actually see the

1114
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,640
oil on the jars when you bring it out

1115
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,119
but i would you know you get ice water

1116
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,440
hash fresh frozen you know whatever you

1117
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,680
can smell all the terpenes in there rso

1118
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,720
all pretty much smells the same you can

1119
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,799
get

1120
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,679
you know differences there

1121
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,440
but

1122
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,279
i'm even trying to go deeper with it on

1123
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,400
figuring out how to decarb the ice water

1124
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,000
hash

1125
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,280
you know properly to be able to just eat

1126
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,960
that

1127
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,119
and i experiment a lot with this stuff

1128
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,199
because the terpenes are carriers

1129
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,680
terpenes are a big part of the healing

1130
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,679
process

1131
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,000
and i believe that's a big part of the

1132
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,720
royal cush you know those are it's like

1133
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,960
the sour diesely purpley kush afghani

1134
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,039
mixture smell that you damn near finding

1135
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,838
nothing else

1136
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,358
and that terpene profile really helps

1137
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,920
that to go over

1138
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,319
raw juicing cannabis leaves guys from

1139
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,880
the same powdery mildew resistant uh

1140
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,280
strain we're all juicing flour tastes

1141
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,119
horrible do it

1142
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,119
healing properties come from this stuff

1143
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,199
i'd like to get into

1144
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,640
a little bit of even the the root tech

1145
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,879
making medicine now the roots from the

1146
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,039
rule seven but i i just haven't stepped

1147
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,000
to to that level yet

1148
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,480
um

1149
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,559
making a sad out of rule seven for like

1150
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,480
the the issue that i've got on my chest

1151
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,078
or out of another powdery mildew

1152
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,000
resistant strain

1153
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,960
and i'm always cautious when people are

1154
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,199
like well i've got a train that's

1155
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,720
probably resistant is it is it really or

1156
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,519
are you a good grower you just don't

1157
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,519
have powdery mildew so it's like let me

1158
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,519
see it growing right by a powdery mildew

1159
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,800
plant i remember the first time you were

1160

create powder and mildew and i'm like

1172
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,279
man i'm trying to find the strings that

1173
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,598
the

1174
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,400
that powers through that [ __ ] you know

1175
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,680
um my the work this year

1176
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,200
and i'll say it because i bred it

1177
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,199
because i got my by the hydra tknl5 haze

1178
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:04,159
pam did horrible outdoors with powdery

1179
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,639
mildew the work no bud rot no powdery

1180
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,559
mildew pushed through the cold and in

1181
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,799
michigan we had the wettest grow season

1182
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,880
and and the vapor pressure deficit like

1183
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,440
we had days in in august this year that

1184
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,519
were 50. in the next week it was eight

1185
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,639
you know so it like the plants taking

1186
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,480
that pressure

1187
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,799
um so i'm

1188
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,960
i'm gonna break down a bunch of the work

1189
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,000
in the rso form what i have learned

1190
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,119
though now is to not go off

1191
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,199
royal ever i've done that a couple times

1192
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,119
right so everything complements the

1193
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,358
royal kush seven that you've got i went

1194
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,838
off royal from

1195
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,000
december to

1196
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,679
july this year

1197
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,159
for personal reasons i went into other

1198
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,559
rsos different stuff i deteriorated so

1199
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,000
bad and i still didn't just make the

1200
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,199
pair up

1201
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,559
and

1202
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:56,239
uh got back onto the royal in july about

1203
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,078
the time that you know things were real

1204
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,759
bad then um

1205
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,039
i was telling people goodbye calling

1206
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,480

1207
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:03,440

to get anywhere how desperate are you to

1221

seven you know at wonderland i knew when

1227

i got home i had to veg it up for a few

1228
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,680
weeks take cuts get it in the flour and

1229
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,440

1234
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,358
shout out to emily mountain for

1235
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,440
continuing it uh

1236
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,838
it is a uh

1237
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,280
it is a very medicinal medicinal plant

1238
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,480
but just because rule seven works that

1239
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,079
way for me

1240
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,079
and i do believe it'll work that way for

1241
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,119
you if you're battling lyme disease but

1242
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,880
maybe you have a different issue um

1243
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,880
had a brain injury from concussions

1244
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,559
you're you're battling cancer you're

1245
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,720
battling whatever you've got to find

1246
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,199
strains that pair that up look at

1247
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,519
terpene profiles look on the nih you can

1248
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:32,000
research this stuff

1249
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,079
find the strains that work for you

1250
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,280
all marijuana is not created equal there

1251
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,119
are some rsos i i will never take i love

1252
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,480
smoking the flour but the rso isn't

1253
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,519
worth it you know

1254
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,519
um

1255
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,960
and unfortunately to figure out that

1256
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,800
information you got to go through trial

1257
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,559
and error and sometimes that error can

1258
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,000
be very costly

1259
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,239
so it's on that point that i want to

1260
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,480
finish up with you today and that is

1261
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,959
this idea that you know

1262
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,559
you have shared with us over this 40

1263
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,440
minutes or so

1264
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,078
what has been you know a life's work for

1265
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,920
you and then it got way more intense you

1266
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,599
know three and a half years ago right

1267
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,680
and and and so you've gotten even more

1268
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,680
intense the last three and a half years

1269
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,358
and part of why you wanted to do this

1270
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,000
video was because

1271
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,759
um so many people contact you via you

1272
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,679
know instagram and everywhere because

1273
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,280
they hear that that you're the guy who's

1274
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,598
using rso

1275
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,680
to manage his lime

1276
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,280
and and that and they want to know why

1277
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,480
right and so we're doing this so that

1278
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,319
you know you could just send them the

1279
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,838
link right and they can hear your

1280
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,079
thoughts all at once

1281
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,480
i know that there are people who are

1282
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,280
watching who are feeling like

1283
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,440
so overwhelmed right because of all the

1284
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,599
all the information all the detail

1285
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,519
people maybe who aren't from cannabis

1286
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,079
and so they don't even really know a lot

1287
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,719
of the vocabulary they're using so for

1288
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,760
these people they're to have to learn

1289
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,519
all of that to even do what you're doing

1290
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,440
and i'm sure that a lot of these folks

1291
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,480
are overwhelmed so what i'd like you to

1292
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,000
finish with

1293
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,480
is you know real direct advice for the

1294
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,480
lyme folks who are watching

1295
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,920
what words of encouragement can you give

1296
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,519
them to about about

1297
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,400
completing this what seems like

1298
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,639
insurmountable task because you know

1299
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,960
you are overcoming insurmountable tasks

1300
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,239
just staying alive every day and i know

1301
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,880
that you've given a lot of thought to it

1302
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,799
philosophically so so what advice can

1303
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,280
you give folks about

1304
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,480
just doing it

1305
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,200
i guess uh a first thing is mental

1306
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,559
health wise you're a warrior

1307
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,799
and that's not just the lyme folks

1308
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,799
that's the anybody sick you're a warrior

1309
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,318
you're battling something that that

1310
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,480
other people around you do not

1311
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:45,039
understand and do not know so keep

1312
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,719
worrying on i mean that's very difficult

1313
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,559
to say but

1314
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,000
but take pride in the fact that you are

1315
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,000
a warrior and you're overcoming stuff

1316
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,199
that others aren't um

1317
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:59,119
i do understand this is overwhelming

1318
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:01,838
start off by looking at

1319
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,480
research rick simpson oil

1320
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,480
um of course some of these things talk

1321
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,760
about harsh chemicals

1322
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,960
rso you you need to avoid that i do use

1323
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,520
um alcohol to make rso but we don't use

1324
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,240
naphtha anymore no no we don't do that

1325
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,639
but

1326
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,799
so you take that piece out but you can

1327
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,879
go to rick simpson's actual website they

1328
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,318
have good information at least starts

1329
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,240
the process

1330
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,480
um

1331
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,159
don't be as overwhelmed with it

1332
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,679
realizing you're taking your life in

1333
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,358
your hands and you're creating your

1334
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,440
medicine if you're scared when you do it

1335
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:39,519
at first start with a half ounce start

1336
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,519
with a quarter you know be a small watch

1337
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,679
somebody can help you if you're in a

1338
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,960
legal state um there are tons of videos

1339
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,358
on youtube

1340
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,400
but you have to find the right ones

1341
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,078
um it is very overwhelming and and i get

1342
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,440
it i've been through the whole process i

1343
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,119
had literally

1344
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,720
leave my home and everything i was

1345
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,240
familiar with in kentucky to move to

1346
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,078
michigan to do this

1347
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,000
uh

1348
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,680
take a deep breath

1349
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,358
reach out to some people maybe you need

1350
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,960
to go to dispensary and go ahead and get

1351
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,799
some from from the right place though

1352
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,639
i'm cautious about that how was it grown

1353
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,240
what was in it what if it's grown

1354
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,799
synthetically all that stuff it's gonna

1355
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:21,039
compound when it's made um

1356
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:24,400
see i'm even gonna make more issues um

1357
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:26,800
be calm find an organic grower find a

1358
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,960
real caregiver in your area

1359
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,160
and there are real ones everywhere and

1360
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,838
they will help you um

1361
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,159
just uh

1362
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,759
send it send people messages try to talk

1363
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,598
that's what i did in the beginning even

1364
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,760
with you different people like i tried

1365
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,920
to learn more and understand i get tons

1366
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,520
of messages i can't answer them all and

1367
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,318
i i get overwhelmed by it but

1368
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:52,318
this is a step that maybe cbd can be the

1369
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:54,318
first step that at least starts building

1370
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:55,679
your cannabinoid system

1371
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:56,960
is what i usually have people do for

1372
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,239
like four or five days if they've never

1373
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,318
took cannabis it'll build the

1374
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,479
cannabinoid system and activate it so

1375
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:06,318
that the first initial boom is not just

1376
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,079
knocking them out for 24 hours so far so

1377
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,920
it does get better

1378
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,760
it can get better and you have to be

1379
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,880
your own fighter and hero and i know

1380
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,880
that sucks i know it's scary i've told i

1381
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,640
was talking to shingle inside that

1382
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,000
when i got sick i truly believed in the

1383
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:21,519
medical system like you went to the

1384
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,119
hospital you're sick doctor's going to

1385
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:26,000
help you it's it's not that case

1386
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,760
especially if they don't understand

1387
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,440
find people that can help you

1388
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,680
there's a lady named eclectic alchemy

1389
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,358
look her up i mean there's herbalists

1390
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,558
and healers that can help you through

1391
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:36,799
your journey

1392
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,880
to get there they can guide you because

1393
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,240
it's a lot from the mushroom tech to the

1394
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,838
rso to even knowing when to take it and

1395
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,439
i recommend

1396
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,799
you know in the beginning for somebody

1397
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,000
on ourselves take it right before you go

1398
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,519
to bed because if it's negative

1399
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,880
experience you're sleeping through most

1400
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:52,880
of them and yes you're going to wake up

1401
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,640
a little hungover in the morning coffee

1402
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,000
is your friend during those moments you

1403
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:57,838
know um

1404
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,480
just keep powering through it

1405
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,960
it gets better and

1406
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,280
if i can help you i'll try but

1407
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,280
mine and your focus always needs to be

1408
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,200
yourself i

1409
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,079
tried to help so many people with that

1410
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,399
journey

1411
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,400
and then i left my own journey you know

1412
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,760
you have to remember that you're the

1413
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,880
patient also you got to take care of

1414
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,720
yourself

1415
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,800
so um

1416
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:22,480
that would be

1417
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,000
it's overwhelming i know that that would

1418
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,079
be where i would start

1419
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,519
all right well yeah

1420
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,200
one more thing all right well you just

1421
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,679
said about overwhelming and i can't

1422
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,838
reiterate the first time i made that

1423
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,078
that r so i literally cried in kitchen

1424
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,000
thinking i'm going to ruin all this and

1425
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,839
800 i told you inside i could have been

1426
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,838
80 million i couldn't replace that

1427
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,318
so i also say that to growers be

1428
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,640
compassionate you know

1429
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:51,119
it's not hard to make rso and get that

1430
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:54,639
to people in need um and everybody

1431
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,960
should do that to an extent we we rode

1432
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,558
the wave of marijuana as medicine to get

1433
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,318
it legalized they will now put your

1434
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,480
money where your mouth is help people

1435
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,079
