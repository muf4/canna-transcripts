1
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:18,349
so Josh and Kelly I'm really glad that

2
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:21,140
you took a second to hang out with me

3
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:22,849
you know I gotta admit I can fanboy a

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,160
little bit because I have been following

5
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:27,528
your work for a while and through your

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,509
products is actually was the first I had

7
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:32,268
thought about amending with all-natural

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,000
ingredients back several years ago now

9
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:39,649
but because of that I've known the two

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,359
of you as as as living soil kind of

11
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,588
educators right and then you know they

12
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,479
all kind of come together a living soil

13
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:48,439
and permaculture and just general

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,509
healthy living right and you know now

15
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:53,179
that I have the opportunity to interview

16
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:56,599
people about probiotics and probiotic

17
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:59,238
growing of cannabis you know I see what

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,969
I think is a kind of a new rise and in

19
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,378
probiotics and living soil and KNF which

20
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,239
is taking off everybody wants to talk

21
00:01:03,378 --> 00:01:07,359
about but I don't I don't have the depth

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,400
at YouTube you go back you know you know

23
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,049
decades or maybe more right and so I

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,020
wanted to get your perspective what are

25
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:17,299
you two seeing from you know traveling

26
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:19,640
to teach and your customer feedback and

27
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:22,520
and just what you also get from living I

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,560
think between Nelson and Canada and

29
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:26,959
Southern Oregon so you get you've got a

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,269
really good perspective so so what are

31
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,858
you seeing as far as like this what I'm

32
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:32,868
experiencing is this this is this

33
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:35,839
massive increase in probiotic cannabis

34
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:37,819
interest yeah we've been thinking of it

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,280
as in talking about it with some

36
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:41,629
colleagues and lady at Juliet skunk

37
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,039
magazine is really awesome we've been

38
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:45,289
talking about it as like a Green

39
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,239
Renaissance some people like to say the

40
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:49,670
green rush but it's like not a rush it's

41
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,468
it's a it's a renaissance because in a

42
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,539
way all these years we've been like my

43
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:55,188
silly ating underneath the earth and

44
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,040
just working on our web and our

45
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:57,929
connection

46
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,880
making it alright make sure we all have

47
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,980
the right food and in a way it's like a

48
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,069
fruiting of all of our knowledge right

49
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,460
now and so we're seeing an amazing

50
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:11,099
amount of farms making the transform the

51
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,040
transformation into natural farming and

52
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:17,069
also we're seeing the system come out

53
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,109
with a lot of stopping points for

54
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,239
pesticides and a lot of testing that's

55
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,600
kind of almost making you know synthetic

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,420
growing dangerous and not yummy might be

57
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,609
failing products and stuff so well I

58
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,789
also think that you know we're we're not

59
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,760
believing them this any more a big AG a

60
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:37,229
big farm of big corporations and we are

61
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,899
starting to question that and it is

62
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:42,239
giving not only educational flow to

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,159
people but it's also freeing them from

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,320
like these ideologies that we used to

65
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,729
have and I think that you know the the

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,519
growing that Josh and I have been

67
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,469
partaking in for 25 years is so in now

68
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,420
because it involves health and it

69
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,939
involves like breaking that myth of

70
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,259
being taught that only an NDK is the

71
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,689
only way that you can feed your plants

72
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,310
which is like touch such a joke as well

73
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,229
as you know a pharmacies are the only

74
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,469
way that you can treat your ailments so

75
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:09,810
it's been really fantastic seeing people

76
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:12,000
question and I think that you know once

77
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,099
you're given like a really big sort of

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,780
bad idea then it's making people

79
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,949
question and people are questioning it

80
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,719
and then they're using into their own

81
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:21,988
gardens and they're like oh my god this

82
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,330
is totally amazing so I think that it's

83
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,430
the right time and also I also think

84
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,530
sorry is that I think that um it's

85
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,989
leading by example to it's not meeting

86
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,669
it's not needing to force you know away

87
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,799
on someone or anything that's just

88
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,689
saying hey this is the way we're doing

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,180
it and it resonates and people you know

90
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:41,400
try the ganja they see the differences

91
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,200
the lab reports everything shows that

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,989
the natural systems are the better way

93
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,399
to go so the leading by example and then

94
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,049
the proof sort of coming out in the

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,450
pudding with the laboratories it kind of

96
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,030
solidifies it that this this is what's

97
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,789
to investing it must feel kind of pretty

98
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,979
miraculous to you guys for for do you

99
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:00,719
know you know 25 years ago right when

100
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,539
you started this and people were all

101
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,769
like you know NPK synthetics oh what do

102
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,418
you what kind of hippie stuff are you

103
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,700
guys talking about and now over the

104
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,349
course of time

105
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,238
think that instead of you trying to push

106
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:12,859
it on others people are coming and now

107
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,409
that you pushed it on yes but you being

108
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,609
there as a resource right instead of

109
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:19,069
that people are coming you it's like

110
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:21,138
please teach me right that must be kind

111
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:23,389
of astonishing it's really we're

112
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,250
incredibly humbled by it because you

113
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:29,389
know we never put ourselves out there to

114
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:31,310
be you know a leader or an educator it

115
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:32,540
just became it just became natural and

116
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,100
it was something that we felt like we

117
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,810
had to offer and it resonated with

118
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,210
people and we're seeing big changes on

119
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,030
the farm so yes it's it's amazing to see

120
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:42,228
the growth of it and for us it's the

121
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:44,029
light at the end of the tunnel there's

122
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,759
so much doom and gloom in the world

123
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:49,699
there's so many things that are just for

124
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,860
texting into a dark hole so I just want

125
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,300
to believe that there is hope there and

126
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,400
it's not just wanting to leave there is

127
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,310
hope and and this is the hope you know

128
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,709
and so it to have something positive to

129
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,069
grab on to that's where the true change

130
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:06,829
comes from inspiration equals change

131
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:08,418
forcing ideologies on someone it can

132
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:11,029
create opposition and that's nice

133
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:12,769
resistance yes and I think since we've

134
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:14,869
been doing it so long we know that it

135
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:16,579
works and so like Josh said you know

136
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,918
it's showing people are flowers or our

137
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:20,060
huge vegetables or you know taking soil

138
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,589
test samples

139
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,389
to see Wow we've got everything that we

140
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:27,138
need there in order to grow great crops

141
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:29,418
and yeah just so many years into it you

142
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,000
know we've had lots of failures we've

143
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:33,740
had lots of successes we've we've we

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,870
really tweaked our recipes and we've

145
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,939
come up with like a lot of our own

146
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,100
fermenting that works for us in our zone

147
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:42,230
and our area and what kind of plants can

148
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,060
we pull out and what Queen we use in

149
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,629
nature or what can we grow in our own

150
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,339
gardens to create that herbal biomass

151
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:51,168
that you know if your nutrient deficient

152
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:52,519
and a specific nutrient in your soil

153
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:55,310
then what is it that you can grow to

154
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,899
help bring you know that into your soils

155
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,540
and there's been a lot of trial and

156
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:01,159
error to get to where we are and and

157
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,810
that's where their groundbreaking part

158
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,100
comes right because you know a lot of

159
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,300
times when this information is not

160
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,100
available because you know when you all

161
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,660
started learning this the the internet

162
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,389
didn't make the information possible

163
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,710
right so you'd run into somebody over

164
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:13,850
the course of moving yourself around the

165
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,029
world and you're like oh my gosh this

166
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,650
person told me yeah and then you go and

167
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:20,629
you try it yourself or you know a few

168
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,429
seasons every which way and then now

169
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:24,288
you've got your own best patenting your

170
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,720
own best practices and that's a huge

171
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:28,490
deal it is and we have traveled the

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,380
world quite quite a lot in our

173
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,079
relationship we've been together for 25

174
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,759
year over 25 years now and we have a 21

175
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,949
year old child and we've travelled the

176
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,629
world the whole time we've done disaster

177
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:41,209
relief we've worked with women and

178
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:43,699
children and birth we've seen how

179
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:45,288
nutrition affects women and babies and

180
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:47,149
placenta as we've seen how nutrition

181
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:47,560
affects the food which makes them women

182
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,299
me

183
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,850
even they may be eating a lot but

184
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,560
they're malnourished so nutrition and

185
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,300
well-being has been a major part of our

186
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,550
life and so for having it all come

187
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,730
together and one kind of modality right

188
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,889
now is incredibly powerful we also know

189
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,740
that with you know compounds like

190
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,970
dicamba and the defoliating agents that

191
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,750
are out in the world right now we're

192
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:14,139
losing millions of acres every year to

193
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,660
contaminants we are charged up and

194
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,668
inspired like we would almost like give

195
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,620
up sleeping and eating if we had to just

196
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:23,199
to continue to put the message out there

197
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,629
that there is a different way we can

198
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,209
survive and thrive on this earth without

199
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:30,519
these degenerate systems something you

200
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:32,589
invest into it and to bring it back to

201
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:34,269
the cannabis industry it really fits

202
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,679
into what it is that we're doing because

203
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:37,689
there's so many people that have to

204
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,329
reduce their cost in order to stay in

205
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:41,889
this industry the big corporate guys

206
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,659
that are in the big takeovers and

207
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:45,970
they're doing a lot of NPK well they're

208
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,550
bringing down the price program so much

209
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,190
that our focus is now on small farmers

210
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,569
to be able to stay in the game and

211
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:54,490
reducing your impact on the earth

212
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,399
reducing your impact on how much you're

213
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,879
spending really comes from nature so how

214
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:03,219
can you make Stone Soup yeah you know it

215
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,810
really is it's a Stone Soup and we came

216
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,220
up with a lot of different recipes off

217
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,379
of nothing and Josh was talking about

218
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,820
you know going to different areas and

219
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,800
opening up clinics well we were having

220
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,050
to start clinics with nothing what is it

221
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,879
that we can take from the area and the

222
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,860
region and the zones that we're in to

223
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,389
create something amazing to create a

224
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,400
soup that can nourish every I'm now

225
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,168
taking a bit of a Moringa tree and just

226
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,289
putting it into hot water and having

227
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:27,839
them drink Moringa Tekin

228
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,840
changed their health and well-being you

229
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:35,370
know people it's amazing and you know

230
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:38,850
it's a passion so um one of the things

231
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,179
that inspired me of y'all is that you

232
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:45,330
are active educators right like you you

233
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:49,379
don't miss an opportunity to both both

234
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:52,230
share your successes and and how you got

235
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:54,419
there and and so you're speaking all

236
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,629
over the place and for a lot of us you

237
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:00,389
know we are learning about probiotic

238
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:03,149
gardening in all of its forms online

239
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,189
right you know you know either you know

240
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:07,289
websites or forums like the probiotic

241
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,760
farmers alliance on Facebook where

242
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,559
people are coming together to share

243
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,259
information and that's awesome right

244
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,029
because we can rapid prototype ideas

245
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,919
really fast when you've got when you've

246
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:19,019
got well like like pro bike farmers

247
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,429
lines 30,000 people right maybe maybe

248
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,720
that's a little bit too big but point

249
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:24,659
being a lot of people working together

250
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,660
can can hone down a question really

251
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:30,299
quickly and get to an answer it also in

252
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:32,939
these days when everybody's all stressed

253
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:36,329
out there's more people flaming each

254
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:39,570
other online and and it's it's difficult

255
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,450
to learn in some of these environments

256
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,430
now and and I'm continually trying to

257
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,050
support or you know encourage people to

258
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:51,750
keep teaching each other right because

259
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:53,639
when when when when the internet sites

260
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,009
are filled with arguments everybody just

261
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:57,600
wants to walk away right and and that

262
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,519
might be good sometimes to take a break

263
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,230
from a lot of the political stuff but

264
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,000
learning about how to take better care

265
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,259
of ourselves to grow better cannabis

266
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,639
plants to grow better food

267
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:07,740
we don't necessarily really want to take

268
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,870
a break from that so I just wanted to

269
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,639
hear your thoughts about you know the

270
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,700
kind of idea of like each one teach one

271
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,980
where where where where yourselves as

272
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,750
leaders thought leaders in the in the

273
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,269
probiotic and cannabis growing community

274
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,830
and me because I have you know access to

275
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:25,649
an audience what what are your thoughts

276
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,360
about what everybody should be doing to

277
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:29,220
continually make sure we're teaching

278
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,850
each other well I think it's really

279
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,028
interesting

280
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,220
first off what sparks me is that there's

281
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:37,549
a differentiation even in our language

282
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,290
between the word health and happiness

283
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:42,958
why is it that health and happiness are

284
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:46,439
two separate words and I really feel

285
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,750
like when we're gaining information or

286
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,459
we're gaining health through information

287
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,169
out there I think that it's incredibly

288
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,309
important that it also makes you happy

289
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:54,809
yeah that's true

290
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:56,549
you know it needs to make you feel good

291
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:57,958
so the information that we always put

292
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:59,909
out is something that's going to make

293
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:02,278
people feel good and it's also going to

294
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,870
give you health so if we didn't separate

295
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,480
those two words of health and happiness

296
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,970
and we really might not even be in this

297
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,209
predicament so I really encourage people

298
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,949
to continue to find education and about

299
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,078
health and well-being through what makes

300
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:17,278
you happy if you're seeing something on

301
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,189
the internet that's not making you happy

302
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,620
it's probably not healthy either so you

303
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,110
know really be drawn to whatever makes

304
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,419
you feel good and you know we we like to

305
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,610
draw wisdom from our elders so you know

306
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:31,169
we're just one cog and the whole wheel

307
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,620
and you know we have a lot to learn

308
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:35,429
still

309
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,589
and Bob Snodgrass you know as a part you

310
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:39,208
know close family member of ours and you

311
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:41,230
know his big teaching which i think is

312
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,969
amiss a beautiful thing to say is that

313
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,490
he really believes that there's a bell

314
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,560
curve to consciousness into

315
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,810
understanding of things and he you know

316
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,419
when he created the glass pipes with the

317
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,399
gold and the silver he created something

318
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:56,169
that was magical and instead of keeping

319
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,000
that secret to himself and making a

320
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:59,799
million dollars and not teaching anyone

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,200
at his algebra teacher taught him that

322
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:04,990
you know Humanity is learning at a

323
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,220
really slow rate and as soon as everyone

324
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,129
starts teaching each other

325
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,019
consciousness rises and it rises up and

326
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,750
we all grow and it's like the hundredth

327
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,549
monkey idea so we you know we've taken

328
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,009
that similar type of approach you know

329
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:20,109
we we are in the middle of our evolution

330
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:23,080
we're learning and growing as we as we

331
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,580
you know as we grow older and we think

332
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,490
that it's really powerful to be able to

333
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,950
share that message and to not create

334
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,899
divisive nasaan the internet I think is

335
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,810
really a really important thing you

336
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,939
don't have to put out something and

337
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:38,979
react to someone's answer if someone's

338
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,660
gonna come at you or whether they're a

339
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,759
troll or whether there's someone that

340
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:45,610
doesn't believe in you that's okay yeah

341
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,470
that's also known as conversation and if

342
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,029
you don't have the right words to come

343
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,160
out and prove that what you know you're

344
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,079
saying is right then hey challenge

345
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:54,909
yourself find the right the right words

346
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,800
but but don't don't take it as a

347
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:58,779
stifling thing let's let's move forward

348
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,949
let's all share our information because

349
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,449
that's what's getting us where we're

350
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,340
going and we're moving pretty fast right

351
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,620
now with our knowledge and also the

352
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,269
Buddhists say I just love this that

353
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,039
there's only two emotions and all

354
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:11,980
emotions are based under these two and

355
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,509
that's love and fear so if there's anger

356
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,920
that's coming out on the internet or

357
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,569
something that you feel angry within

358
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,669
yourself and there's some kind of a fear

359
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,470
that you really need to address to turn

360
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:22,269
that into love because love is the

361
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,519
happiness love is the health and love

362
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:27,490
that that's where we all need to and

363
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,039
so really encouraging people to go with

364
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,899
the love and let go of the fear and I'd

365
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:33,099
also like to say you know that's a big

366
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:35,830
reason why we created the pure

367
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,540
certification which is it was created

368
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,220
because there was no organic

369
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:41,079
certification and it seemed like there

370
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,870
was just product going onto the shelf

371
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,459
with no actual you know form of

372
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,929
accountability you know there was like

373
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,609
how do you prove that that's good

374
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:51,250
there's no system involved so we thought

375
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,490
you know well the USDA is in the end and

376
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,990
modern agriculture has never been

377
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,669
something to you know to learn from

378
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,629
because there's so many broken things in

379
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,069
there so you know we're gonna make

380
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:03,070
something that's different we're gonna

381
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,680
say this is all organic and it meets all

382
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,570
the USDA standards by getting toxicity

383
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,039
reports and soil tests and water tests

384
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,260
the farmer would do that on their own

385
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,610
why do they need to pay someone to tell

386
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,919
them what they're doing is right so

387
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,839
we've created a format where it's like a

388
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,569
in each one teach one type of a

389
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,730
situation where you know we put a format

390
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:25,290
out and it's it's a it's a community

391
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:28,600
monitored community supported

392
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:29,980
certification so we've said here's all

393
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,259
the things that we know this is why

394
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,899
closed loops matter because its health

395
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:36,429
its well-being you you know what's going

396
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,828
in your products you there's no

397
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:40,479
surprises afterwards and it's empowering

398
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:43,359
it's empowering to say oh look at that

399
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,560
tree it's filled with calcium or it has

400
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,899
trace minerals because it has really

401
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,429
deep roots you know part of our

402
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,589
traveling was going to Hawaii and

403
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,819
learning about natural farming and a

404
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,500
long time ago we're learning about

405
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,390
natural farming and we're living on the

406
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,909
land and we started looking at bio

407
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:00,189
dynamics and rudolf steiner like oh the

408
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:02,620
horns and the grounder almost like the

409
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,360
same as IMO's and well that's because

410
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,149
people that are connected to the earth

411
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,649
are getting the same type of information

412
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:10,539
and maybe a different forum a bit from

413
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:12,879
about modality of teaching so we never

414
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:14,110
said we're only KN effort we're only

415
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,328
natural farming or we're only

416
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,970
permaculture or were only bio dynamics

417
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:21,519
we're all of it we're humans you're

418
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,320
pro-life we're human beings we come from

419
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,949
the earth and we take out cigarette

420
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,120
butts when they're there and all the

421
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,379
thing with the peer certification that

422
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,429
josh didn't mention that i think is

423
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:33,559
really important is that there's

424
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:35,329
we have over 85 farms that are jumping

425
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,789
on this because they were already on

426
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,860
that path and maybe people now are

427
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,990
saying oh I want to do this and now I'm

428
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,450
really inspired through love through

429
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,759
held through happiness to better my

430
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,379
practices on my farm so there's so many

431
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,389
people that you know like us who have

432
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:52,399
been growing for you know three decades

433
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:54,649
that were like hey I fit right into this

434
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,669
I have already been doing that and then

435
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,169
it starts to create a higher

436
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:58,219
consciousness and then you've got the

437
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:59,629
egg your bell curve that Josh was

438
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,519
talking about and once you have more and

439
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:03,439
more people than it does shoot right up

440
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,429
because everybody is on the same

441
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,860
intention and our intention here is

442
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:12,500
healthy pure cannabis one of the things

443
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,950
that I like that you you both espouse is

444
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,330
this idea of sharing all the information

445
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,340
and that letting people choose for

446
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,770
themselves and one of the things that I

447
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,139
like is that y'all share everything

448
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:25,399
that's in your products right and we're

449
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,559
in this time where a lot of people are

450
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,750
trying to monetize yeah intellectual

451
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,359
property right I won't let you techno my

452
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,730
trade secret right or I have SOPs for

453
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,169
extraction but because our oil looks so

454
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,659
good I'm not going to tell you right and

455
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:44,809
like I'm I'm you know I don't own this

456
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:47,539
IPO and I'm alright so so what have you

457
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:48,799
learned from your own example of sharing

458
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,409
your inputs because a lot of people

459
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,639
would be afraid to write exactly what's

460
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,500
in the product on the bottle cuz they're

461
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,120
like oh someone's gonna copy me but I

462
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,549
know that you have shared your inputs

463
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,679
and dragonfly' earth medicine has

464
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:02,750
thrived so so what's been your

465
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,970
experience with essentially given a

466
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,680
given in a way and then still being able

467
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,990
to sell your product well people coming

468
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:14,000
back to us who have used our recipes and

469
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:16,130
given us flowers that blow me away is so

470
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,009
totally amazing and then they're just

471
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,620
really excited and they also say my

472
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:23,480
health is also improved my flowers and

473
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,129
my growing has improved and my health is

474
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,990
improved and I've gotten off all of

475
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,240
these different pharmaceuticals just

476
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,799
because I tried out your recipe because

477
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,940
they trusted it yes they knew what was

478
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,619
in there

479
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,380
now we've done different businesses

480
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,649
throughout the years and we never felt

481
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,230
like someone taking our idea was a

482
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,509
direct challenge to us we felt like

483
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,490
we're very innovative people we're very

484
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:49,349
charged up we're wanting to learn all

485
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,150
the time of all of a sudden someone all

486
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:53,279
of a sudden 10 companies come out with a

487
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,420
bunch of micronized errs and bacteria

488
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:59,160
awesome awesome

489
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:02,550
and everybody so we got people all over

490
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:05,009
the place that invented it yeah awesome

491
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,109
that's a that's a that's a point of it's

492

499
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:26,489
that we're sharing everything and and

500
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,049
people haven't taken it at any and if

501
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,430
they do they maybe they'll just be an

502
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,869
impostor and that's trying to do the

503
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,570
same thing whatever it is it really

504
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:35,279
doesn't matter to us because just like

505
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:36,869
you know sharing everything if more and

506
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,670
more people are doing it it's just a

507
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:40,829
positive thing to there because born

508
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,660
well you have to be the only ones that

509
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,669
know everything we don't want to be that

510

person we're writing a book so we've

511
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,769
been reading a book for like three years

512
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:53,069

513
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:54,750

514
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:57,149
up so we'll be sharing that and

515
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,279
hopefully people will take it and run

516
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,290
with it and utilize it and maybe write a

517
