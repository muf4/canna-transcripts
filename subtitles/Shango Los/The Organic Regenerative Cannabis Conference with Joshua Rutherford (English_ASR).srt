1
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,649
so Joshua thank you for taking a second

2
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:15,530
to talk with me here at Emerald cup you

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:19,939
know I have been really aware of your

4
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:22,460
soil cultivation science conference that

5
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:23,539
is starting to tour the country and you

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,868
know I think it's really cool that

7
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:29,539
people can finally get high-quality soil

8
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:31,759
science education you know that that is

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,259
on tour right and it's going to them so

10
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,730
I wanted to take a second so you could

11
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,439
tell us a little bit about the

12
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:38,000
conference so that people can check it

13
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:40,640
out yeah man well thanks for letting me

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,649
talk about it I mean the reason is in

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,990
the name the science of organic

16
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:47,299
regenerative cannabis cultivation

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,480
conference and it's definitely Longwood

18
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:52,640
it has definitely a tongue twister but

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,828
it's you know it's the ideas to break

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,539
through the murky waters of organic

21
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,429
regenerative growing and as I was

22
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,659
learning to do this it was very hard to

23
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:01,880
find people that could teach me the

24
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,649
science everyone's got their methods and

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,359
it may work on their farm but when you

26
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:08,170
translate to another farm it's a

27
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,159
different environment to provide biodome

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,810
so that's kind of what we're trying to

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,100
do is is bring some of these heads in

30
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,290
who haven't been able to talk about

31
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,839
cannabis because of legalization and

32
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,150
like say bring a mont or and and really

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,700
bring people through the process of each

34
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,859
step here's compost you know here's soil

35
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,799
structure we have dr. Elaine Ingham who

36
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:29,450
is famous soil food web lady she comes

37
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,909
to like open the conference up and

38
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,590
teaches about the players and then we

39
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,090
walk with ship Osborn into soil

40
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,368
chemistry soil diversity

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,228
and we have Layton kind of talking the

42
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:41,549
same thing soil leighton-morris and he's

43
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:45,269
my partner that actually puts this on

44
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,040
with me and the day two we switch into

45
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,379
biostimulants with chris trump who i

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,420
think you know he does came thanks great

47
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,250
KNF is amazing i actually took his

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,109
course this summer and I am offering

49
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,420
fermenting everything yeah all the time

50
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,489
and so he you know it's a way to create

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,810
bio students or nutrients on your

52
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,089
property with the stuff that's do you

53
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,118
know around you and then we have dr.

54
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,700
Faust which everybody knows bio AG humic

55
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,439
acid public asset like definitely a

56
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,359
component that's hard for us to acquire

57
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,519
on our properties you know a reality

58
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,290
kick Kevin Joel trees even flying out

59
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:18,239
isn't he that's day three and like I am

60
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,949
so stoked that Kevin's come in like he

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,239
brings the full package together as when

62
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:23,310
we gone day three we get to talk about

63
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,530
genetics and he's bringing in breeders

64
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,330
from each region for instance you know

65
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,370
we're going to Vancouver to Ann Arbor

66
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,469
Michigan to read way some southern

67
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,629
Humboldt and into Portland Maine

68
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:35,639
so he's bringin read breeders from that

69
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,549
region so we'll have a seat a seed swap

70
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,869
and a genetic swap it like I just

71
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,610
couldn't be so blessed to be around

72
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,189
these heads and learn from them and like

73
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm it's it's great man so so so if

74
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:49,319
people want to find out more about it

75
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,480
will you give them the website slowly

76
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,979
cuz I've messed it up a couple times

77
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,659
myself so what's the website where

78
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,409
people can find out more I for trying to

79
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,650
make it easier

80
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:59,120
regenerative organic cannabis calm right

81
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,510
on

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,539
yeah thank you so what are the what are

83
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:08,628
the four cities again humboldt i'm

84
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:12,348
baltic and then vancouver canada yep

85
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:14,810
right and then is it Portland Maine more

86
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:17,539
than May and then Ann Arbor Michigan you

87
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,340
got it so so if you're anywhere drivable

88
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:20,598
from those areas make sure you check it

89
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,140
out it should be a good time

90
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:26,539
lots of name-brand so science folks and

91
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:28,009
and you'll get to be Joshua - yeah and

92
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,628
one more thing I'd like to say is this

93
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:32,090
that one thing we do different here is

94
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:33,739
we don't have any sponsors your ticket

95
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,780
sales pay directly for the speakers to

96
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,579
come and travel and be there they are

97
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,289
there to talk with you to communicate

98
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,090
with you and hang out you know it's not

99
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:42,919
so that's in an out deal it's really

100
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,530
like so they're there to hang and so you

101
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,389
can actually get like you know off class

102
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,310
time with these these folks

103
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,529
instead of them rushing off to you know

104
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,870
their next their next thing so we're

105
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,818
paying them to stay long and extra for

106
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,870
that and so that's you know I just I

107
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,399
feel like it's really important to be

108
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,079
authentic in that and you know not not

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,939
judging anybody for doing vendors or

110
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,459
sponsorships but this is your thing you

111
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,870
want to do it your way

112
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,120
right on well I wish you and Layton the

113
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,769
best with the program and we'll talk on

114
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,840
the other side and and see how when

115
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,840
awesome REI great to see ya right on
