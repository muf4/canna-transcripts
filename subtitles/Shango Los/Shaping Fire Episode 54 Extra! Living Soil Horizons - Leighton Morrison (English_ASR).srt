1
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,160
hey there so we're gonna try to do

2
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,589
something different

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,769
normally when we record an episode of

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:20,800
shaping fire we just do it audio only

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:23,079
but our friend Lee Morrison is here

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,600
today and we just recorded an episode

7
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:30,038
with him and it's very true that there

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,939
is one aspect of how the layers of soil

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,730
the horizons of the earth really could

10
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:39,969
use a visual graphic and so Layton had

11
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:42,669
the great idea why don't we show you the

12
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:45,339
graphic now and he will walk us through

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,350
it a little bit and then and then we

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,020
encourage you if you have not listened

15
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,539
to the podcast episode go why or go

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,280
listen to the podcast episode and if you

17
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,469
are here because you already listened to

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,210
the podcast episode hopefully this will

19
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,890
give you a better understanding of the

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,750
information that we covered so lately

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,838
thank you so much for joining me both on

22
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,269
the episode today but then also now here

23
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:09,459
in my living room good so wonderfully so

24
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:11,769
so I'm gonna go ahead and insert the

25
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:14,259
graphic here okay and why don't you go

26
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:16,329
ahead and explain the and the important

27
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,040
intricacies that maybe we're more

28
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:21,400
difficult without looking at the graphic

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,799
itself perfect you know it's interesting

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,009
you know the cannabis industry as a

31
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:30,070
whole has has looked at soul we do

32
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:32,950
Verizon at the top the ori so verizon it

33
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:36,339
so stands for organic and you know

34
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:39,579
everything has been focused on getting a

35
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,250
matrix or a system that will allow fast

36
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:45,279
routing and for nutrients to be absorbed

37
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:48,459
and obviously pulled up by the plant and

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,090
so in that regard it makes sense that

39
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:55,599
you use a pure organic matter like a

40
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:58,118
peat moss or coke or any of these other

41
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:01,478
growing mediums but the interesting

42
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:03,519
thing is is that that works great with

43
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:06,459
nutrients but as soon as you go into a

44
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,590
living soil system or an organic

45
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,538
regenerative type of farming

46
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,120
it does not work because the organic

47
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:14,949
matter has a couple issues number one it

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,709
goes hydrophobic which means that it

49
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:20,560
will not absorb water and it goes

50
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,259
anaerobic on the inside so it's a double

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,269
negative so this is why I tried to

52
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:27,519
explain to people that if you're going

53
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:29,739
to go regenerative organic you need to

54
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,900
consider all the horizons just like the

55
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:35,319
soil just like the mother nature dieted

56
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:38,019
in creating these different layers that

57
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:39,729
provide different things we're gonna

58
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:41,739
start with the over eysan generally

59
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:43,750
speaking in these diagrams you'll see

60
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,239
it's very small it's a very tiny layer

61
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,610
can only be an inch you know half an

62
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,409
inch deep in a lot of cases in the most

63
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,180
productive and fertile soils on the

64
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,709
planet which is a good love this

65
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,629
question what do you think the most

66
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,370
fertile soil is on this planet I hope I

67
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:02,859
see the Amazon ready the rainforest

68
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,140
ready right wrong that's the top soil do

69
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,959
Verizon is very small there it is

70
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:10,149
just maybe nature too actually it's the

71
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,870
prairies in West because you'll have the

72
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,329
O horizon as deep as 2030 feet we'll get

73
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,670
into soil trance

74
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:21,219
construction in the podcast but for

75
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:24,429
right now I want you to think about okay

76
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:26,560
well the over aizen's very deep how do i

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,439
drain that how do I prevent that from

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,180
going hydrophobic that's where those

79
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,789
other layers what's called the a horizon

80
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,159
and the B horizon come in and then you

81
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:37,449
also have sometimes the e horizon which

82
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,310
is the alluvial layer

83
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,899
that'll generally happen in old drainage

84
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,310
areas well riverbeds

85
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,069
that's where you're gonna get a

86
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,439
concentration of an e there so typically

87
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:50,018
it's just the over aizen to a rise in

88
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,329
the B horizon the B horizon is gonna

89
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,159
tend to the more mineral-rich which

90
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,719
makes sense because the plants you know

91
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,418
they send their top roots down and

92
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,318
they're gonna be able to absorb those

93
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,150
clay particles and

94
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,968
minimal concentrations that exist inside

95
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:08,718
the clay to their atmosphere through the

96
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:10,759
network of organisms now the day horizon

97
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:12,500
in my mind is the most important for

98
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,408
cannabis growers because that's going to

99
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,180
pull excess moisture out of the horizon

100
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:19,879
so that's going to prevent them from

101
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,709
going anaerobic so a literally acts like

102
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,870
a wicking system so think of it as

103
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,329
pulling the moisture away excess

104
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,850
moisture away from the plant away

105
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,668
pulling it out of that over eyes which

106
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,620
is holding it like a sponge so it's

107
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:36,258
actually going to help in transpiration

108
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,360
which means providing oxygen down into

109
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:41,030
the soil roots for the organisms and

110
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,050
also pushing the co2 out for the plant

111
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:47,989
so so and you're using vocabulary that

112
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:52,728
we use to describe the horizons of the

113
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:54,019
earth you know how top soil thank you

114
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:55,788
they could call it the skin of the earth

115
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,500
but your butt your butt now you're

116
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:59,659
making I think that you're making this

117
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,819
transition to talking about how we're

118
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,370
layering our pots mm-hmm so are you

119
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:06,529
suggesting that instead of us taking our

120
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,149
soil and just mixing it all together you

121
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:10,189
actually are gonna lay one layer down

122
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,709
and lay another layer down and then lay

123
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:14,569
another dilator down is that the idea so

124
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:18,560
it's called biomimicry that copying

125
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:20,930
nature it's very easy to do when I work

126
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,639
with clients generally speaking is I

127
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,009
will have a few different horizons

128
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,199
planted for usually I'll used to be

129
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:29,269
horizon or lluvia layers for drainage

130
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,978
underneath and I using a horizon and

131
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,109
then and then organic matter or a deep

132
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:34,908
organic matter and authorize it okay so

133
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,560
basically it's just three Verizon's the

134
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:38,779
bottom horizon generally speaking I'll

135
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,879
just take rocks three-quarter-inch rocks

136
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,918
one-inch rocks whatever and I'll blend

137
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,629
it some coarse sand so I'll pack the

138
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:46,609
rocks down and I'll put a layer of sand

139
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:49,250
over the top of it the reason I use the

140
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,788
sand is it's EMSA more as a sand filter

141
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:56,418
system we use it and aquatics equal

142
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:59,389
aquatic ecosystems to actually filter

143
00:05:56,418 --> 00:06:02,060
out the fine particulate so in this case

144
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,250
it's reverse were protecting the soils

145
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,990
from migrating to finds our because we

146
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,759
don't want those lines to come out of

147
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,740
the soil every time we water so we

148
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,840
trapped

149
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,730
santé botnets on the same layer so the

150
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,919
roots could still go down migrate or

151
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,140
pull out the minerals and nutrients from

152
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,449
those finds and we're never gonna get an

153
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,009
anaerobic layer which is huge because if

154
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,649
you have an anaerobic layer the roots go

155
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:27,500
down to that go down the die and they

156
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:29,989
die and then now they did the alcohol

157
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,720
actually melts the tip of the root and

158
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,970
that plant cannot healed every that's

159
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,130
done so you're never gonna hit plant

160
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,930
potential if your roots are hitting

161
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:41,480
analytic zones so that's why it's so

162
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,819
critical this drainage so then we have

163
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,100
the a horizon which is again gonna have

164
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,860
a higher contest and so it's protecting

165
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,080
the over Eisen from losing its nutrients

166
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,000
and it's fines from migrating down and

167
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,709
plugging up the whole system so that's

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,079
why each one of these layers is so

169
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:59,000
critical and should be taken into

170
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,930
consideration especially for doing pots

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,870
alright so um what else is in this

172
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,900
graphic that you want to point out

173
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,759
before we just wrap this up and send

174
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:12,649
people off to the podcast what should

175
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,360
they be what's what should they be seen

176
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:17,750
when they're looking at the graphic I

177
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,730
think the most important thing is is for

178
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,889
them to wrap their mind around the fact

179
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,410
that this is layered and it's layered

180
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:27,110
for a reason and it works and functions

181
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:30,439
correctly and effectively because it's

182
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,930
layered so when you dig a hole next in

183
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,370
your backyard for those layers and and

184
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,980
you know get into it and notice the

185
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,019
color change pick up those soils and rub

186
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,689
them in your fingers and feel them and

187
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,370
you'll see the difference in texture

188
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:45,560
gentleman that I'm working with spent

189
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,629
sales which is a big issue with cannabis

190
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,759
growers and he's you know I love it he's

191
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,680
like I'm trying to be good about this I

192
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,399
have mountains of this fence so what can

193
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,439
I do with it

194
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,689
I'm like alright let's start with basics

195
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,730
let's add a little bit of sand to it and

196
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,350
I want you to put it in a cup drill some

197
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,960
holes in the bottom and watched a lot of

198
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,900
move through it and do the same without

199
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,759
us and so he started playing around with

200
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:10,039
that he was like oh my god this is

201
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,009
totally different it feels gritty its

202
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,410
draining better I don't have it doesn't

203
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,819
get smelly and I'm like to see this you

204
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,070
know just by adding that little bit of

205
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,599
stain to that over aizen or that spent

206
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,939
soil you

207
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,310
you're getting it to function better so

208
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,469
when you're considering building soils

209
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,509
you've got to think about the function

210
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,580
of it how do I get water to move through

211
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,740
it without turning anaerobic how do I

212
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:35,478
prevent an aerobic layers and all of

213
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,849
that happens naturally in nature through

214
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,788
these layers rather through using de

215
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,669
layers to separate and to hold and

216
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:45,529
protect from from too many my vines

217
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:47,929
migrating into the deeper lower levels

218
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,339
right on good point so so the graphic

219
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:51,139
that you've been seeing this is

220
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,860
essentially what started this episode

221
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:56,750
that late and I are recording because I

222
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,419
saw this at the regenerative agriculture

223
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,480
conference that he and Joshua Rutherford

224
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:04,189
put together and and when I saw it and

225
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,500
and he's suggesting that this is how we

226
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,060
should be building our pots like my mind

227
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,860
was blown right because I'm all like you

228
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,779
know all we take our soil we saw it we

229
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,180
makes mix the soil when we put it in and

230
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,159
then when we do some sort of green mulch

231
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,409
right so that's like pretty basic stuff

232
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,289
but the idea that I actually should be

233
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:24,319
making you know three or five mixes and

234
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:26,929
then pouring them in order I think

235
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,629
that's a new way for us all to grow as

236
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:32,899
farmers so that we can be growing the

237
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:34,939
most thriving quality plans so so if

238
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,769
this is new for you like it is for me I

239
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,160
encourage you to go and check out the

240
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:43,189
the new podcast episode out today the

241
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,620
same day I'm publishing this video with

242
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,890
Wayne Morrison and listen to that it's

243
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,190
gonna be a long long form explanation of

244
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,419
this but then also this video is here so

245
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,700
that everybody can check out this

246
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:57,409
graphic that we'll be referring to a lot

247
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,629
in the podcast so can I just add one

248
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:01,819
more yeah um you know I think it's

249
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:04,789
important for you to understand it this

250
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,680
technique is for using it forever in

251
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:08,419
other words you're not replacing this if

252
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,250
you're just cutting the plant and you're

253
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:12,949
leaving the soil long this is a

254
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,269
long-term functioning pot and part of

255
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,259
this is because we're trying to

256
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:17,329
establish that micro

257
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,669
the network which takes 90 days to get

258
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,470
going so that's about the time you're

259
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,509
harvesting your plan so this way you can

260
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,389
harvest your plan you can save your plot

261
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:28,879
you can save the mycorrhizae that's been

262
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:30,710
the entire sphere is intact ready to go

263
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,929
for your next plan and you're not

264
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,570
dumping it this is this is a permanent

265
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:37,129
constructed soil that can be reused over

266
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,730
and over and over again for your entire

267
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,950
life

268
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,960
yeah this is best practices for no-till

269
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,960
yeah yeah awesome thanks for him right

270
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:54,388
you
