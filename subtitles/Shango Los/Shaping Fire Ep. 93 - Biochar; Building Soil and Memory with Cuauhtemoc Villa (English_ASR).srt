2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,039
today is another episode where i will be

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,880
learning right alongside of you when i

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,199
started cultivating i thought soil was

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,480
mostly inert and it was like a computer

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,320
insert npk and out came cannabis flowers

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,719
over time though i have been humbled by

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,160
how little i knew and i'm grateful for

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,719
all the regenerative cultivation

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,719
pathfinders who constantly teach me what

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,799
they have learned so that i can grow

12
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,719
better flowers in a way that most honors

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,679
the earth so i can be part of the

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,760
solution and less part of the problem

15
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,920
one thing i have learned again and again

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,000
is that the soil is its own universe it

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,559
is infinitely complex

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,558
a truly regenerative cultivator doesn't

19
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,039
see the soil as something apart from the

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,359
earth and separate a regenerative grower

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,120
sees the soil in their hands as the

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,039
earth itself

23
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,599
as regenerative cultivators we are

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,239
constantly completing cycles closing

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
loops and acting in service to the earth

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,798
and that's an important aspect being in

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
service to the earth really focuses our

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,799
attention on how we can help the earth

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,880
heal from the damage we have done as

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,880
humans and how to work in partnership

31
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,438
with the earth to grow the best damn

32
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,879
cannabis possible

33
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,478

i'm your host shango los

64
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
my guest today is kawatamak via

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,199
guatemakia is a highly respected and

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,520
sought-after regenerative soil educator

67
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,839
he is a friend of the microbes student

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,159
of their ancient wisdom and teacher of

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,159
their ways he has years of experience

70
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,400
working with effective microorganisms

71
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,000
and creating custom soil blends specific

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
to the needs of the plants he's working

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
with

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,439
he does work in bioremediation of land

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,840
and waterways and teaches school kids

76
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,560
these practices he also teaches

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,479
indigenous agricultural practices today

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,759
we're going to talk about biochar

79
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,079
during the first set we're going to get

80
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,280
a good understanding of what biochar is

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
during the second set we're going to

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,280
learn how to make biochar and in the

83
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,158
third set we learned best practices for

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,280
using biochar in your garden of any size

85
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,598
welcome to the show kawatamak thank you

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,640
so let's get right into it we've all

87
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,280
probably seen biochar and seen folks

88
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,679
making biochar but let's all start with

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,039
a basic understanding of what biochar

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,239
actually is

91
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,280
when we take wood and burn it in hopes

92
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,480
of making biochar what is it exactly

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,479
that we're hoping to make

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
what we're trying to do is we're hoping

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
to

96
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,798
create and leave behind just the carbon

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,759
structure of the biomass

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,439
that we're

99
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,878
uh burning

100
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,519
and by doing that by just keeping the

101
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,318
skeleton the carbon of the of the of the

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,959
biomass this is going to then contribute

103
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:52,399
so many benefits to the biology of the

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,519
soil as we consider life we consider

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,920
things need water but we also must

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,759
consider how important carbon is as well

107
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,719
and that's what we're going to have when

108
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,479
we made good biochar is a good high

109
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,359
percentage of carbon

110
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,199
um

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
remaining from the burn

112
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,359
i like that idea that um we're trying to

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
get ourselves down to the skeleton how

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
you put that we're kind of like burning

115
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
off the fat

116
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,238
um what are the aspects of the wood that

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,519
we're trying to

118
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,198
remove

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,000
so that we can get to the carbon core

120
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,800
we're gonna we're gonna um burn off all

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,478
of the volatile gases from the biomass

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
and these volatile gases is what's going

123
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,758
to contribute to the fire but as the

124
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,840
heat pressure increases as

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,040
this heat pressure is then going to

126
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:44,000
extract or if you can imagine squeeze

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,000
out the volatile gases from the biomass

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,319
and hopes of just leaving us those

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
skeletal remains the carbon

130
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,040
so in a way

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,439
we are kind of refining carbon in a way

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,439
we're we're taking this beginning

133
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,560
material of wood

134
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,879
and we're getting rid of everything that

135
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,199
we don't necessarily want to use as a

136
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,839
fertilizer and purifying it into

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,919
i guess a specialty

138
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,119
carbon exactly and

139
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,439
um

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,160
within the structure of that carbon it's

141
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,319
gonna be formed into a shape which is

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,400
very similar to a beehive

143
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,360
and that honeycomb structure is then

144
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,560
gonna be

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
home for

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,120
many beneficial microorganisms

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,160
nematodes

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,399
water nutrients but i think most of all

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,720
we got to remember is these bones or

150
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,719
these carbon remains also have

151
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,840
electrical information

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,800
about that plant in which it grew in and

153
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,119
this becomes a major contributing factor

154
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,960
in the regenerating growth of the new

155
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,399
successors of that plant

156
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,478
all right i'm gonna i'm gonna bring us

157
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,719
back to the electrical information

158
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,360
in a minute i want to start with your

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,880
first point there on um on honeycomb the

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,680
honeycomb structure

161
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,038
so um and this may be too vague of a

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
question but i'm going to give it a shot

163
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,560
anyway

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,918
is there any explanation

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,079
for why when we burn wood we're left

166
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,799
with the honeycomb i mean it's such a

167
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:18,639
it's such a unique shape and it's so

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,478
detailed um do we know why after we burn

169
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,720
it it looks like that

170
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,199
yeah it's the pattern and the energy in

171
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,360
which drove the force of that plant to

172
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
transport water and nutrients up and

173
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
down

174
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319
so you know i call it skeletal remains

175
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,400
but it can also be looked at as veins

176
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,720
but it's the pattern and structure of

177
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,679
that particular um

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,479
a plant or tree and this is this becomes

179
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,360
very important because each structure

180
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,000
within each plant and tree is going to

181
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
be created differently and it's in the

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,160
diversity of those structures which

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
allow

184
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,560
many different kinds of microorganisms

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to then call that carbon home

186
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,280
so each unique structure will foster a

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,120
unique set of life forms all right

188
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,119
that's that's totally cool i was not

189
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
expecting that badass answer all right

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,598
let's let's dig into that a little bit

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,199
so first of all um i really like the

192
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:17,120
idea that um it is showing the

193
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,319
vein structure

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,399
of the plant because it

195
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,120
you know this is to my fault as i learn

196
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:28,478
about plant biology i learned more and

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,680
more that that my my understanding that

198
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:34,079
it's kind of uniform within the plant

199
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,400
and there's just you know

200
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,598
the flesh of the plant and then the

201
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,839
outside is just a real misunderstanding

202
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,240
of what's going on in the interior

203
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,239
botany of the plant and i don't think

204
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
i've ever thought about that until now

205
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,038
because i've i've seen what biochar

206
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,840
looks like up close and it is so

207
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,560
detailed and and you know you've got

208
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,799
you've got pits here and elongated bits

209
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,959
there and and and if you're telling me

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,520
that that the burning reveals the guts

211
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,239
of the plant this is telling me that the

212
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,120
inside of the living plant is far far

213
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,639
more complex than i am imagining as a

214
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,918
cultivator

215
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,439
100

216
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,598
we're just scratching the surface on

217
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,000
this thing you know we've

218
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,120
looked at the plant in so many different

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,360
ways

220
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,360
but now as we're looking at

221
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
the electrical influences that shape the

222
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,038
plant

223
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,519
and we get into this fourth phase water

224
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,120
we realize how electric these things are

225
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,199
and anything electric is going to need

226
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,799
conductivity and just like we see

227
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,719
mycelium growing differently and

228
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,718
threading differently these patterns in

229
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,839
nature they repeat themselves because

230
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,159
they work

231
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,720
so we're finding these patterns and how

232
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,278
they relate to not just mycelium or

233
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
plant growth but your own human body

234
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,919
there's so many patterns within

235
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,559
everything

236
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,479
that it's just become so ex and this is

237
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,958
what makes the work so exciting because

238
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,519
i'm just a farmer i'm not a scientist

239
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,079
never have been but the excitement of

240
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,320
watching patterns and shapes

241
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,040
you can see the relations and how

242
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,600
they all come together mm-hmm

243
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,519
so let's let's let's tie into the

244
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,399
electrical info because now you've hit

245
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,720
on it twice and i gotta admit like i

246
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,958
i've gotta know that there is our

247
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,879
electrical impulses in

248
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,879
plants as there are through all of

249
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,480
nature but to

250
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,838
hear you

251
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,920
talk so quickly about the uh the

252
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,040
electrical info or the electrical

253
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,719
history of the plant i i must admit i

254
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,319
don't exactly even know what you mean by

255
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,560
that so so break that out a little bit

256
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,959
for us okay so if we think of like a

257
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,518
forest and how that grows

258
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,518
and how important the fire is to that

259
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,679
forest to continue to grow and stay

260
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
healthy so it's not overran with

261
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,239
invasives

262
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,879
we can see where that fire as it comes

263
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,639
through and burns and leaves behind its

264
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,639
skeletal structure

265
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,360
that that new plant that grows the new

266
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,439
seed that grows is always stronger than

267
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
the original plant

268
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,320
now

269
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,639
when we think of storing information in

270
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,360
carbon this is nothing new all of our

271
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,439
phones and computers all use carbon that

272
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,959
we call silica

273
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
and

274
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,359
the basis of loading information onto

275
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
the silica so we can access it when we

276
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,759
need information we can just whip our

277
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,078
phones out and get it we've never

278
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,759
contributed or related that to the

279
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,278
forest itself

280
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,039
when we leave behind the carbon

281
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,120
structure of the parent grandparent

282
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,480
plants that have burned and their carbon

283
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,799
is in the soil their successors can do

284
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
the same thing they can tap into that

285
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,879
carbon they can know the relationships

286
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
their parents and grandparents had

287
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,480
meaning trees

288
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
and how those symbiotic relationships

289
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,159
worked because it's in the carbon

290
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
structure of the char

291
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,399
and this is what makes the forest

292
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,959
so intelligent

293
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,000
and evolves the way that it does because

294
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:04,399
it stores information and even now we

295
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,039
realize there's microorganisms these

296
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,519
electron microbes that can join together

297
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,759
create a force that can influence a

298
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,759
lightning strike into an area

299
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,799
you can see where the forest fire is not

300
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,439
random

301
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:21,278
but more of a specific we need to create

302
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,959
memory here the microbes somehow decide

303
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,240
influence a lightning strike to

304
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,719
carbonize

305
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,440
because this is how the planet has done

306
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,920
it for so long so these patterns are

307
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,320
nothing new they've always have happen

308
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,599
we mimic them as we develop computers

309
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
and software even as we talk biochar we

310
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,159
would

311
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,760
have we're used to doing this with

312
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,199
farmers and conservationists and groups

313
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,600
like that but now we're getting the

314
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,519
semiconductor industry in the workshops

315
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,399
because they're looking for other carbon

316
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,519
sources besides silica to create

317
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
computers

318
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,360
and things like cannabis

319
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,760
and hemp are testing at 200 percent more

320
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
semiconductor potential than other

321
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,559
materials

322
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,719
this is why we're now seeing the

323
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,399
computer guys at the workshops asking

324
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,200
questions about the electrical side of

325
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,320
things

326
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,399
where

327
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,639
the sky's the limit with carbon

328
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,919
and we're just scratching the surface

329
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,720
the idea that biochar could be

330
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,479
you know a natural hard drive for nature

331
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,399
is like you know truly mind-blowing

332
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,200
right um

333
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
so

334
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
it

335
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,240
how literally should we take this idea

336
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,759
let's say that we've got a hugelkultur

337
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,680
we're throwing biochar in it and then

338
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,919
we're growing our cannabis plants on top

339
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,559
and the roots are going down and they

340
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,639
come in contact with the biochar and up

341
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,399
until our conversation i've been just

342
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
imagining that moment is about two

343
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,559
things it's about

344
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,639
the nutrition fertilization for my plant

345
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,679
coming in contact with the biochar

346
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,039
because it loves that um

347
00:12:53,679 --> 00:13:00,399
that pyrogenic carbon um but but then

348
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,919
and then also it is touching the bio the

349
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,120
roots of my cannabis plant are touching

350
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,120
the biochar which is a home of microbes

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,839
and so it's providing them a variety of

352
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,600
shelter too so that's cool but but now

353
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,680
you've added something else which is

354
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,320
this this carbon from the now deceased

355
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,958
and biochard plant

356
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,440
that there are at a very simplistic

357
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,719
level data points that are stored in

358
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
this carbon

359
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,839
if we want to get a little more poetic

360
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,639
about it maybe it's like the story of

361
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,760
the tree that is being passed on to my

362
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,680
cannabis plant like like

363
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,519
like i i guess i don't even know what

364
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,519
i'm asking here how literally should we

365
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,600
take this fact that there's information

366
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,399
going from the tree

367
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
to my cannabis plant okay so we know

368
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,879
that plants could communicate through

369
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,599
terpenes and when the plants have more

370
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,919
information when they have learned a

371
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,800
great deal of information from being

372
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,120
under the stars growing under the sun

373
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,439
being in contact with carbon that

374
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,360
information then transfers into what we

375
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
know as terpenes

376
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,639
now

377
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,079
when we test cannabis that's grown and

378
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,799
this is what i love about the legal

379
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,719
industry now we us as the old farmers

380
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,559
everyone we always knew we had flavorful

381
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
herb but now we're to have the terpene

382
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,359
test

383
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
and we can see those terpenes are

384
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,560
getting higher and higher with the more

385
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,639
carbon or more information we're able to

386
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,638
work with that plant and this is what

387
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,480
makes it so exciting and when we send

388
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,000
this stuff into extract

389
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,199
where typically the capture of the oils

390
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,039
under

391
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:40,078
normal organic farming they were about

392
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,480
four percent of the capturing uh oil out

393
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,638
of biomass and extraction

394
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,879
we've got the number up to seven percent

395
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
there's way more information or what the

396
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,679
bosses say oil there's way more oil now

397
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
in the flower and then aside from that

398
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,319
we've doubled and tripled the terpene

399
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,879
scores which for me that's the most

400
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,079
important number i'm looking at because

401
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,919
then that is telling me that we are

402
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,439
working with the plant closely together

403
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,919
and that plant is going to have more

404
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
information to then share with the human

405
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,838
who's going to consume it

406
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,838
and that's why when we smoke the good

407
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,880
herb with the good flavor you're going

408
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,920
to ask yourself who grew this where did

409
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,360
it grow

410
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,278
if you don't know the name you want to

411
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,399
know the name of it and the parent of

412
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,039
that plant

413
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,278
so when we're growing cannabis we've

414
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,679
taken cannabis from a

415
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,519
it's it you know from a very um

416
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,879
money driven industry but there's

417
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,120
cultures where

418
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,120
this is exactly how the cannabis plant

419
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,839
was raised the more

420
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,600
the cultivator grows and becomes a

421
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,720
better person as they work with the

422
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,480
plant the plant knows the intention and

423
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
that information or what we call

424
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,440
terpenes is starting to increase

425
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,759
and this is why special growers not just

426
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,360
with cannabis whether you're doing

427
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,919
farm food or grapes wine there's certain

428
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,639
things where you can do the same inputs

429
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,278
but if the heart of the farmer is not in

430
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,360
the position of continuing to want to

431
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,198
grow and make

432
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
and improve himself

433
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,599
then that information becomes limited so

434
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,679
the ultimate goal when we grow these

435
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,759
plants is really about

436
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,679
how we can become better humans but then

437
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,039
at the same time the information in

438
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,638
which those are gonna people are to

439
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,639
consume those plants

440
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,320
you have got to hope that that's the

441
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,799
same thing that's going to happen when

442
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,079
they take on the information so for me

443
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:35,359
information is translates and into

444
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,599
terpenes and into more oil so there's of

445
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,600
close relation we just have somehow

446
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,120
missed the mark because we get i mean

447
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
when you're doubling your oil production

448
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,600
they start counting the stacks of cash

449
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,399
they're not thinking about what we just

450
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,639
talked about but me who always wants to

451
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,799
improve myself i realize man that is can

452
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,320
only be done with a close relationship

453
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,559
to the plant

454
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,720
to the soil and to the people who are

455
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,719
going to consume that plant

456
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,240
envisioning who they are

457
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,838
and carrying that with you as you work

458
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,759
out there in the field that's the

459
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,159
information the plan needs it's also an

460
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,959
indictment of large-scale

461
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,798
automated growing too because the more

462
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,078
large the more you scale and the more

463
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,558
you automate

464
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,399
the less the interaction

465
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,038
less interaction the farmer has with the

466
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,759
plant and you know it's no joke that

467
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:29,200
highly automated commercial flower is

468
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:32,480
gonna have lower terpene profiles than

469
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,160
than slower than smaller scale deeply

470
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,599
loved plants

471
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,519
and um

472
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,038
you know and and and your argument is

473
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,798
that you know

474
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,079
if the farmer's not involved and the

475
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,720
terpenes uh percentages are lower

476
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,279
um it is very true that the cultivator

477
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,960
is communicating less with the actual

478
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,480
toker and that's a really interesting

479
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,038
idea

480
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,160
yeah and um yeah those are the kind of

481
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,480
things where

482
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,160
as we strive to grow the best we have to

483
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,200
realize we're also trying to grow our

484
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,360
best self

485
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,200
and it's so closely related to

486
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,319
how those things go hand in hand right

487
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,679
on so so let's talk about this specialty

488
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,439
carbon that we are um

489
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,400
uh that we're trying to refine out of

490
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,279
the wood

491
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,160
so so um you know they call it pyrogenic

492
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:25,279
carbon of course but but why why is this

493
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,960
carbon so uh effective and so uh well

494
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,440
hell it's also expensive right if you

495
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,840
buy it what's so special about pyrogenic

496
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,798
carbon compared to other carbon sources

497
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:39,119
that we could feed our plants

498
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,720
um so what we're going to look at is

499
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,639
how the carbon is going to react within

500
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,200
the soil and there's so many soil types

501
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
people have around the country

502
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,480
some people you know they use a lot of

503
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,519
water some don't

504
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,440
it just seems like the carbon is allows

505
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,558
for that forgiving factor

506
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,160
and

507
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,839
let's be real when people are learning

508
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
to grow or they're

509
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,119
trying to increase something

510
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,279
uh terpenes or something they always

511
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:07,119
want to use more of the formula

512
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:09,599
so i'm finding like with the biochar

513
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,519
it has such a forgiveness factor on not

514
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,839
only the water that we're using the

515
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,798
ingredients that we're using

516
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:19,678
but when we wanted to go too much it it

517
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,359
seems to be a buffer and and keep our ph

518
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,720
in a range that's going to be favorable

519
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,519
for the plant

520
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,759
um

521
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,879
and then that being said when our plants

522
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,839
are growing we don't realize our soil is

523
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,200
like a battery and if we're draining

524
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,439
from

525
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,440
the battery it's gonna have less and

526
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,038
less energy to supply the plant

527
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,240
especially as the plant develops and

528
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,919
grows bigger

529
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:47,038
um so the char allows for

530
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,759
the energy to be kept up in the soil but

531
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,919
also calculating as the plant gets

532
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,000
bigger all of the sunlight hitting the

533
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,440
leaves are making sugars pump out of the

534
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,359
roots

535
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,519
what's happening are you calculating all

536
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,000
those sugar productions or are you just

537
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,279
calculating your drops when it comes to

538
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,279
soil health

539
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,279
so when i have the bio char and i'm

540
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,200
getting the sugar production

541
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,599
that's exactly what i want when it comes

542
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,159
to growing microbes so it seems to just

543
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,759
allow the microorganism development to

544
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,600
thrive much

545
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,000
more efficiently i mean with permanent

546
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,480
housing come on who wouldn't thrive you

547
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,440
know hard it has hard permanent housing

548
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,519
it has water it has food electricity

549
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,640
that's everything you need to live so

550
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,158
these are the kind of things that we

551
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,919
have to consider when

552
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,200
we're developing soil in your

553
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,720
description of it it sounds like

554
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,759
pyrogenic carbon is kind of like a a

555
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,759
a flexible knowing athletic carbon like

556
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,679
good for any soil in the country can

557
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,679
change and mold itself to what you need

558
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,159
it to be it sounds like it's

559
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,080
it's kind of like a um you know super

560
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,200
carbon you know or something it's it's

561
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,000
it's the

562
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,159
it's a it's a carbon goal that is just

563
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,159
going to simply outperform our other

564
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,320
usual sources

565
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,240
definitely and you mentioned the cost

566
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,359
you know the cost is like super high

567
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,640
right now but what fascinates me is

568
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:11,279
the usda just came off of a program

569
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,280
where they're giving away char free

570
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,279
every farmer in the country i was

571
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,599
talking about this the whole time we got

572
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,240
very little cannabis people to sign up

573
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,839
but tons of hazelnut farmers but here's

574
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,279
what's happening

575
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,079
the um

576
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:29,678
usda is understanding how

577
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,720
we're developing food with no carbon

578
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,038
it's like

579
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,919
making houses without a building code

580
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,919
so by them supplying the carbon free to

581
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,840
the farmers they're going to be able to

582
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,038
continue to collect data

583
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,720
and then they're going to send out

584
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:47,679
portable um biochar units so that the

585
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,279
farms can collect by their own biomass

586
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,080
and convert on site so my point is the

587
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:56,079
agencies now are seeing the value of

588
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,720
char and trying to get it in the hands

589
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,639
of people now so now it's up to the

590
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,240
people to do their homework to figure

591
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,880
out okay is were they just talking this

592
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,279
good thing to sell us biochar or is it

593
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,480
something good for the soil so when i

594
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,158
see the usda now getting involved i mean

595
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,079
if you're doing something other than

596
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,320
cannabis you know about

597
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,119
the the food production issues we have

598
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,798
for that for for our areas especially

599
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,399
low-income areas

600
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,158
this is why they're trying to chart

601
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,360
everybody so we can have sustainable

602
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,080
food so it's just not for

603
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,959
driving your cannabis up to a certain

604
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,519
level

605
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,279
but it's really about developing soil

606
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,400
for long-term

607
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:43,279
investment and we have major players now

608
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,440
giving it to people free well right on

609
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,519
it's too bad that um that uh we didn't

610
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,200
have this conversation before the usda

611
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,879
biochar program

612
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,880
was completed because this would have

613
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,960
been a great plug to get more cannabis

614
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,240
people involved hopefully they'll do it

615
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,000
again

616
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,159
yeah and shingle for sure when um next

617
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,240
time if it happens i'll contact you as

618
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,960
soon as i get the info so we can

619
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,558
continue to support um community use

620
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,038
yeah yeah i'd love to support you i

621
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,960
would love to support that message okay

622
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,960
so let's let's circle back around to the

623
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,519
advantages of the biochar now that we've

624
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,279
got a better idea of you know what it

625
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,440
physically is

626
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,000
so um

627
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,798
when people ask you what the advantages

628
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,919
to their cannabis plant is

629
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,519
what do you tell them

630
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,280
it's going to improve the immune system

631
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,038
of that plant

632
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,759
which then is going to help fight off a

633
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,119
lot of diseases and pests

634
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,119
so i mean it's just like a healthy

635
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,558
person so i'm always trying to encourage

636
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,918
them that

637
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,399
by having a healthy plant you're going

638
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,679
to be able to avoid many things um down

639
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,159
the road that cause

640
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,559
failure in our crops

641
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:55,440
so it's it's not that the biochar itself

642
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,720
is necessarily changing the plant it's

643
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,159
that the biochar is you know providing

644
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,558
homes for

645
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,919
the microbes so that there's a buffet of

646
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:08,558
nutrition in the soil and that it is uh

647
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,200
good at holding water and so the plant

648
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,879
is less likely to dry out and the

649
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,600
in the um

650
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,720
rhizosphere is less likely to have the

651
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,599
microbes cyst up it's it's a is it kind

652
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,079
of essentially a soil regulator and it's

653
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,480
through that regulation that the plant

654
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,359
is going to have better color and better

655
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,839
structure and better pest resistance

656
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,000
yes but also keep it in mind like each

657
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,158
cannabis plant is going to have specific

658
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,640
microbes that they're partnering with

659
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,000
that you know we call the endophytes now

660
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,440
and if we don't make a home for these

661
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
microbes to go

662
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,278
in and out of the plant

663
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,960
and keep going through the loop

664
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,720
then that's really what is going to

665
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,519
drive that the healthy soil and the

666
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,038
healthy plant is fostering the microbes

667
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,119
in which that plant really wants to

668
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,519
partner with and you know we can drop in

669
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,000
inputs from all kinds of a beautiful

670
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,440
creations but essentially what i'm

671
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,599
thinking is

672
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,519
the plant does want to partner with a

673
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,798
lot of the beautiful natural farming

674
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,038
drops we're doing

675
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,519
but it also has like a special group of

676
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,038
partners it already has inside of it it

677
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,319
carried from seed

678
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,119
and

679
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,480
allowing for those little guys to

680
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,558
continue to live whether in the plant or

681
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,278
out of the plant in my char

682
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,558
no

683
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,319
just no i know that i have the a team

684
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,079
for each plant because each plant has

685
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,079
their own different one i have the a

686
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,759
team supported and that gives me a way

687
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,240
better chance of success

688
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,278
right on all right so um

689
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,278
uh before we go to break i would like to

690
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,599
hit on the water retention we've already

691
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,480
mentioned it a couple times but

692
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,839
a lot of people i know this is the first

693
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,798
reason why they go to biochar because

694
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:54,959
you know

695
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,440
many of us especially

696
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,360
container farmers right a little less so

697
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,679
folks who are directly in the ground but

698
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,879
definitely for container farmers

699
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:09,200
we do this um this whiplash thing where

700
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,480
um the the the container goes from

701
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,960
too dry and the microbes are cysting up

702
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,880
and the soil is getting hydrophobic

703
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,640
to suddenly we're trying to make up for

704
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,080
it and we are

705
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,679
um making the soil too wet then

706
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,558
and then so now it's too wet and it's

707
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,559
waterlogged and we're we're um

708
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,200
um we're choking everything out from

709
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,119
oxygen and then we let that dry out and

710
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,880
then then oh my gosh then then in a

711
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,798
couple weeks we were too dry again and

712
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,559
the swinging back and forth we keep on

713
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:39,440
hampering our microbes

714
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,599
and

715
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,519
people say well that hasn't happened

716
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,599
since i've i've i've started using

717
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,319
biochar so so talk to us a little bit

718
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,678
about the water retentive capabilities

719
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,759
and water

720
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,519
equalizing abilities of biochar

721
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,000
yeah so in a lot of applications where

722
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:01,278
we're using the biochar and this is

723
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,798
anywhere between five to fifteen percent

724
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,278
we're able to cut that water down in

725
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:07,359
half and just like you mentioned the way

726
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,319
the water um

727
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,879
enters into the soil or pot and then

728
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,720
respires back out it's all it makes all

729
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,720
the difference on how that plant grows

730
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,798
but with the char since all that those

731
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,880
little pieces are holding water

732
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,158
it's distributed back to the system

733
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,159
seems to be much much slower and it's

734
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,159
just much better for the plant

735
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,000
and we've we've seen

736
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,440
some operations they're doing about two

737
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,200
gallons a day

738
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,240
on full grown plants do fine and even

739
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,200
better

740
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,960
after char was applied at um one gallon

741
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,240
per day and this is mixed into the rows

742
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,679
or if they

743
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,759
another another section they did they

744
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,278
just dug out maybe about 10 gallons of

745
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,879
soil mix the char into there and then

746
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,119
put it back into the hole and planted

747
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,240
the cannabis plant and you couldn't tell

748
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,079
the difference

749
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,319
physically from the plants where the

750
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,879
char was tilled in or the plants where

751
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,000
the char was just put into the hole they

752
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
physically

753
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,398
looked the same and same amount of water

754
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,519
the only difference was when they went

755
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,079
to lab

756
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,440
the um char with the the rose with the

757
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,879
char in the row

758
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
scored higher

759
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,159
but um

760
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,278
plants still physically looked really

761
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,278
good from

762
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:25,278
from the lesser amount of char

763
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:28,839
right on so so if it makes your water go

764
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:32,398
further and it holds your water

765
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,240
longer and it um

766
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:38,079
it's almost like um

767
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,159
over time it gives the soil its own slow

768
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:43,599
drip of water instead of a flood

769
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,960
definitely and then when you think of

770
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,038
like below

771
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,440
all that where all the all the water's

772
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,158
leaching down into when you have um the

773
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,960
micronized char headed further down into

774
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,399
the soil system it starts to

775
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,240
aggregate the soil differently the

776
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,719
biofilms are different and all of these

777
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,640
contribute to water holding capacities

778
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
when you have these um things going for

779
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,440
you that micronized biochar is probably

780
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,278
at the core of why biochar regenerates

781
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,159
uh abused and old soil right

782
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,759
yeah it's one of my favorites they have

783
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,360
yeah because you can also put those in

784
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,679
drip lines they don't clog up it's so

785
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,759
micronized yeah oh wow and yeah and it

786
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,120
just keeps sinking deeper and deeper

787
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,599
through the soil

788
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,479
um it's definitely more costly

789
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:33,119
to use that very fine activated they

790
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,440
have even activated carbon style but the

791
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,199
results are so quick and they can

792
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,558
integrate into many systems whether

793
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,798
you're doing hydroponic or or soil

794
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,558
so these are always like the one quick

795
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,359
shot if they allow me to do anything to

796
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,678
their system well pump into some very

797
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,558
fine micronized char and the electrical

798
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,120
charge back to their soil always

799
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,879
translates into plants praying that then

800
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,038
that's where you get more and more work

801
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,320
when people see their plants lift

802
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,558
that's when they're become more

803
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,119
receptive and it doesn't take long when

804
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:08,639
you add the char there is just something

805
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:10,959
about the healthy glow of a praying

806
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,960
cannabis plant to make you believe in

807
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,798
the strategy you're using isn't there

808
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,679
it's just it i think i think it makes

809
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,839
every cultivator glow with pride

810
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,440
no that's really how we know right i

811
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,879
mean when you come to work the next day

812
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,038
after a drop

813
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,320
and they're doing that i call it plant

814
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,240
yoga

815
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,960
though because the cells are just so

816
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,558
hydrated they're reaching

817
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
you can just it looks like they're

818
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,278
stretching it's a yoga

819
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,880
and

820
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,558
it's nothing better than to come to work

821
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,320
in the morning and see him doing that

822
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,079
hell yeah that's beautiful all right so

823
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,678
we're gonna take our first of two short

824
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,398
breaks and be right back when we come

825
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,880
back uh in set two we're going to talk

826
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:51,759
about um uh choosing wood for making

827
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,080
biochar and how to make biochar and uh

828
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,919
and some best practices uh you are

829
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,000
listening to shaping fire and my guest

830
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,840
today is kawamok via

831
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,919
without these advertisers shaping fire

832
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,439
would not happen so please support them

833
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,159
and let them know you heard them on

834
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,159
shaping fire

835
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,519
for years organic cultivators have been

836
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,519
looking for a peat moss replacement peat

837
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,200
moss has long been the go-to soil

838
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,519
amendment for water retention and

839
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,080
container growing but organic growers

840
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,640
are recognizing now that peat moss is an

841
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,519
unsustainable resource and the mining of

842
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,320
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and

843
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,240
releases sequestered carbon but peat

844
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,359
moss works so well that many have

845
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,679
continued to use it now there is finally

846
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,158
a revolutionary replacement for peat

847
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,480
moss that provides better benefits while

848
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,840
being a sustainable choice

849
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,000
pit moss sounds an axe like peat moss

850
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,240
but instead of being mined from fragile

851
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,640
ecosystems is actually made from

852
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,558
upcycled organic paper and cardboard

853
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,038
headed for landfills

854
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,960
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

855
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,960
in your substrate and creating air

856
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,079
pockets and tiny living environments for

857
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,960
microbes pit moss instantly increases

858
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,639
aeration nutrient absorption and water

859
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,120
conservation too

860
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,120
carefully and locally sourced pit moss

861
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,319
is the result of decades-long research

862
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:16,798
into the use of recycled paper fibers

863
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,720
pit moss is lightweight and easy to use

864
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,319
and pin moss is inert so it won't change

shaping fire i am your host shango los

982
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,838
and my guest today is quatermakia so

983
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,720
before the break we were talking about

984
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:48,480
what exactly biochar was

985
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:51,439
and the advantages to the plant to the

986
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,400
rhizosphere uh in the soil and you know

987
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,000
pretty much the the the earth itself

988
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,079
and certainly the now uh uh microbes

989
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,239
having homes are definitely stoked too

990
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,320
but um this set we're gonna talk more

991
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,598
about actually how to make biochar

992
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
because as we talked about in the first

993
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,559
set

994
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,599
if you're gonna buy biochar

995
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:13,920
um it's actually quite expensive and um

996
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,519
it's really not that hard to make and

997
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,480
and like many things in our cultivation

998
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,199
scene

999
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,280
um you know

1000
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,358
thing you know it's time or money right

1001
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,040
you can save a lot of money if you make

1002
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,358
your own ferments instead of buying your

1003
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,759
own fertilizers and in the same way

1004
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,480
if you've got enough time um if you make

1005
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,359
your own biochar you can have a super

1006
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,159
powerful ally to your cultivation

1007
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,400
without actually having to pay your

1008
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:45,679
hard-earned money for it so so let's

1009
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,400
start by talking about what kind of wood

1010
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:49,838
we should use now during the first set

1011
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,559
you said that

1012
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,000
you know these different types of woods

1013
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,920
they have got

1014
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,059
different

1015
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,240
botanicals

1016
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,358
[Music]

1017
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,679
setups inside of the plant inside of the

1018
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,159
tree inside of the shrub whatever we're

1019
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:08,000
gonna make the biochar out of and those

1020
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,319
provide different types of homes for

1021
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,039
different microbes so that's great but i

1022
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,079
i would believe that you know over the

1023
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:19,119
years you have tried to make biochar out

1024
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,720
of lots of different types of wood and

1025
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,039
and you've got to have some of your

1026
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,439
favorites and for good reason so so talk

1027
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,800
to us about what you think through when

1028
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,960
you're choosing the wood you're going to

1029
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,599
use for a biochar burn

1030
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,358
okay so as i mentioned before one of my

1031
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,599
favorite personal plants it's the

1032
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,679
cannabis and implant um first of all

1033
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,440
because in our industry nobody does

1034
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,078
anything with the stems

1035
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,119
and being that they're 200 more

1036
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,400
conductive than other chars that just

1037
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,039
allows for

1038
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,079
more more electricity in my soil

1039
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,519
and um

1040
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,000
i get to close the loop too in our

1041
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,679
industry by bringing that in into uh

1042
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,838
like we're doing at a veggie farm here

1043
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,319
at the island where i live i'll grab the

1044
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,159
cannabis stocks from the producers on

1045
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,320
the island and then bring them to the

1046
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,279
veggie farm over at topaz farm where

1047
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,960
we'll use it to grow vegetables

1048
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,400
but uh my second favorite would be

1049
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,400
blackberry

1050
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,960
blackberry if you think of the inside

1051
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,760
pulpy material inside of that blackberry

1052
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,880
when it chars all of that pulp turns

1053
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,320
into this beautiful

1054
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,240
crystallization that is easily

1055
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,240
micronized at that point

1056
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,239
and who doesn't have a lot of blackberry

1057
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,639
up here in the pacific northwest yeah

1058
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,959
right yeah yeah so that one's been super

1059
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:35,440
cool but i love doing like the hardwoods

1060
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,358
too any of the hardwoods are gonna just

1061
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,320
get so hot

1062
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,279
and burn at a temperature where you're

1063
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,119
just gonna be able to add in other

1064
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,599
materials to them because the hardwoods

1065
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,358
are burning so hot i can maybe add in

1066
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,079
other kinds of wood i'm maybe not too

1067
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,559
crazy about but because of the high heat

1068
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,480
it's going to give me a different matrix

1069
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,320
of honeycomb structure

1070
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,639
and that's what really excites me um is

1071
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,640
the matrix of the honeycomb

1072
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,639
but really it's

1073
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,078
i love to see what people bring

1074
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,318
we opened up at our farm for the

1075
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,000
community just to drop off their biomass

1076
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:13,039
just so we can convert as much as

1077
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
possible

1078
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,358
and i was finding like the the apple

1079
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
prunings

1080
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:22,159
just made an amazing char as well so

1081
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,079
it's a whole discovery

1082
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,598
i learned off of grapevines those were

1083
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,079
the first

1084
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,039
conversion piles that we did out in napa

1085
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,240
and when they would rotate the vineyards

1086
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,239
they usually would take them to the

1087
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,439
dumps but we started turning them into

1088
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,639
biochar

1089
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,599
and

1090
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:41,759
just incredible incredible char coming

1091
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,800
from the grapevines i gotta admit i'm

1092
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,359
really surprised that you are are

1093
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,359
talking about let alone preferring what

1094
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:53,440
i think of as soft plants like um like

1095
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:56,078
the cannabis and hemp stocks and the

1096
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,679
blackberry versus hardwoods i really

1097
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,119
thought that that the answer to the

1098
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,679
question was you were just going to tell

1099
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,640
me a varieties of of trees that you

1100
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,199
liked um i'm really surprised that and

1101
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,358
and we'll talk more in detail about how

1102
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,199
you know like how to manage the biochar

1103
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,679
burn in a couple minutes but i'm really

1104
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:16,960
surprised that that those soft

1105
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,799
fleshed plants can be used at all

1106
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,240
um because they're so soft i would

1107
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,000
assume that they would just like burn

1108
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,118
right up

1109
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,719
yeah but let's think for a minute

1110
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,838
shingle if we're doing some cannabis

1111
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,399
breeding

1112
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,639
and i'm working with this plant trying

1113
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,240
to look for specific trait

1114
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,400
the plant knows what i'm looking for

1115
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,799
maybe it couldn't get there on that

1116
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,200
on that journey but the seeds that come

1117
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,720
out of it if i don't put those skeletons

1118
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,719
of that plant back into the soil

1119
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,079
it i just seemed like it would take

1120
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,679
longer to achieve

1121
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,400
the characteristics in which i'm looking

1122
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,960
for

1123
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,039
so by adding the bones in of

1124
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,400
the pla the last breeding

1125
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:56,719
cycles

1126
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,720
i think shortens the duration of what

1127
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,719
you're looking for

1128
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,439
because the information then can get

1129
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,519
passed to the new seed where it's parent

1130
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,599
information can to say hey you know that

1131
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,400
farmer that's growing us he's looking

1132
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,680
for these specific terpenes if by chance

1133
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,920
you can grow them

1134
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,838
let's let's increase that and this is

1135
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,920
the strange way of the cannabis plant

1136
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,000
but you can see where if there's any

1137
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,200
legs to it at all

1138
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,880
you can really quicken and improve and

1139
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,799
become more targeted

1140
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,640
in the cannabinoid

1141
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,400
research you're doing by adding in the

1142
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,480
old plants so that's why i like to use

1143
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,559
not only my old cannabis that i've

1144
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,960
worked with but cannabis from other

1145
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,199
farms too because it essentially is

1146
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,720
cannabis and it's going to be talking to

1147
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,318
the new cannabis

1148
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:45,039
just something i think is special about

1149
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,800
that relation well yeah definitely

1150
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,199
something special i gotta i gotta tell

1151
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,119
you you know i

1152
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:54,078
i wouldn't i don't necessarily consider

1153
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,400
myself especially spiritual i mean i

1154
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,240
meditate and all but but

1155
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,358
compared to the kind of ideas that that

1156
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,759
you're

1157
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:05,949
laying out uh you know these are these

1158
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,440
are mostly new to me i say um humbly um

1159
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:10,000
[Music]

1160
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,960
this idea that you are bringing forth

1161
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,599
that

1162
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,920
um the

1163
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:22,800
if the plants are holders of data and

1164
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,960
stories and and how to repair the soil

1165
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,640
and if when we

1166
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,679
burn them into biochar it is

1167
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,318
um

1168
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:38,719
refining the carbon down to its basics

1169
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:42,400
and that carbon is holding memory just

1170
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:44,318
like the carbon silica holds memory in

1171
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,039
our iphones

1172
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:50,000
and if this is

1173
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,519
you know feeding the memories back into

1174
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,960
the earth

1175
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,599
it really

1176
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,079
creates a whole different

1177
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,440
motivation and intention for all of us

1178
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,400
as humans

1179
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,039
to

1180
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,079
take all of our

1181
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:08,559
natural wastes our organic waste and

1182
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,920
turn it all in the biochar and put it

1183
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,440
back into the earth because like duh why

1184
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,079
wouldn't we

1185
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,000
and you know that that whole that whole

1186
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,440
package of idea right there is all brand

1187
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,199
new to me

1188
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,280
yeah and i kind of like to picture as

1189
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,039
you know we have computer programmers

1190
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,240
right and they are loading software on

1191
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,759
computer to run specific apps

1192
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,519
if you think about what you're doing

1193
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,760
when you're making char

1194
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,079
you're a nature programmer

1195
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,440
and that char can be in the soil for

1196
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,359
hundreds

1197
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,639
thousands of years it can have that

1198
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,639
information

1199
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,358
and we'll get into it a little bit later

1200
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,799
but

1201
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:46,960
there's other ways you can load

1202
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,519
information onto the char too

1203
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,720
where the reality of you are really a

1204
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:55,199
co-creator and program in nature

1205
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,879
becomes the reality you can create the

1206
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,039
chart specifically

1207
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,720
from the good healthy blocks of the

1208
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,279
vineyard that you have

1209
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,439
then create char with that information

1210
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,200
that you can put into the less

1211
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,920
healthier blocks

1212
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,279
and continue to co-create and regenerate

1213
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,639
soil that way

1214
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,040
right on that's awesome all right so um

1215
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,679
so we've talked about um your favorite

1216
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:22,159
types of wood and why we want to use

1217
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,519
different types of woods because they

1218
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,039
make different types of housing

1219
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,880
structures and then they carry different

1220
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:29,039
kinds of information

1221
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,039
how about the worst to use are there any

1222
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,199
are there any types of woods that you

1223
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,199
have come across where you're like okay

1224
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,719
most all of them are great but this one

1225
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,000
is really not going to get you where you

1226
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:39,439
want to go is there any wood that we

1227
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,358
should avoid

1228
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,280
no but you do want to avoid using wet

1229
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,279
wood you can buy a moisture meter i

1230
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,720
think they're about 40.

1231
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,040
you want to use wood that's between a 15

1232
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:54,000
and 22 percent moisture

1233
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:56,400
any biomass within that range

1234
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,318
it's gonna combust beautifully

1235
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,240
the only problem you'll have is when

1236
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,079
you're using wood that's wet that'll you

1237
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:03,759
make a lot of smoke if temperature may

1238
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,599
not go up

1239
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,839
and making the biota in the pacific

1240
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,599
northwest because we re it rains so much

1241
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,838
this is very important because you don't

1242
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,720
want to make char and create a bunch of

1243
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,880
smoke if char is made correctly

1244
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,559
you can use that smoke to drive the

1245
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,640
combustion

1246
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,719
so moisture meter will

1247
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:25,279
keep you from all wood is good you just

1248
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:29,279
got to make sure it's dry all right so

1249
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,480
for for all of us cultivators who cut

1250
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,720
corners

1251
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,159
um i happen to be one often

1252
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,399
unfortunately

1253
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,440
and we don't have moisture meters

1254
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,079
clearly a freshly cut tree is going to

1255
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,159
have the highest percentage of moisture

1256
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,160
whatever that may be

1257
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,598
i do have a fireplace though right and

1258
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,279
so i am very used to the idea of taking

1259
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,800
down a tree

1260
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,200
and bucking it

1261
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,880
and then putting it in piles and then

1262
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,480
it'll be good

1263
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,559
the next year

1264
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,199
can you give us like like i don't know

1265
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,279
just like a a rule of thumb or some

1266
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:08,639
guesses for us

1267
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,599
about how long after we take down a tree

1268
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,879
before it would be good for

1269
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:17,760
um for making biochar is i mean is is it

1270
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,640
the same strategy as as

1271
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,040
you know making effective firewood or or

1272
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,519
is it faster than that

1273
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,599
yeah so if we had our trees stacked from

1274
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:30,559
our cuttings from the spring they should

1275
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,039
be dry enough to burn in the fall okay

1276
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,920
um a lot of times too if we make the

1277
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,599
piles but throw a tarp on the top

1278
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,480
they'll release enough water so we can

1279
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,318
burn like if i cut piles in the fall

1280
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,838
but threw a tarp on them

1281
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,440
by springtime

1282
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:49,039
they wouldn't have taken in all the rain

1283
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,480
water and released their water it'd be

1284
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,838
good to use

1285
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,760
but there's always a chance where if i

1286
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,239
wanted to do a burn and i had some

1287
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,359
material that was kind of wet but if i

1288
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:01,439
had

1289
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,639
three quarters percent of that pile was

1290
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,480
really dry

1291
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:05,519
you could integrate and mix

1292
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,760
the two

1293
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,838
and get a full combustion from from the

1294
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,280
material all right so there's certain

1295
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:13,358
little tricks you can do sometimes

1296
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,720
mixing really dry

1297
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:18,639
with wetter material or how you stack it

1298
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,039
or even with some of the kiln

1299
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,318
technologies where you can use stuff a

1300
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,239
little bit wetter

1301
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,079
but typically if it snaps

1302
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,199
you know the rounds that snap you're

1303
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,760
good to go

1304
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,039
all right there needs to be a uh some

1305
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,119
kind of a

1306
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,199
a saying there if it snaps it caps or if

1307
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,480
it snaps it you know

1308
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,399
something to make a bumper sticker out

1309
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,960
of um so

1310
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,119
um i'm assuming that there's probably a

1311
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,838
good conversation to be had right here

1312
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,240
about moving wood you know how

1313
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,799
they say don't move firewood from one

1314
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:54,000
part of your state to the other because

1315
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:57,920
you're moving all sorts of um

1316
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,159
uh insects or or non-indigenous bugs

1317
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,079
that you might be helping spread around

1318
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,759
your state

1319
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,079
i'm guessing that's probably the same

1320
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,119
when you're making biochar i can imagine

1321
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:12,640
people collecting wood at place a

1322
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,200
and then moving it to place b to turn

1323
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:17,279
into biochar where it's more convenient

1324
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,679
for them um

1325
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,760
we probably shouldn't do that should we

1326
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,159
yeah there's times where that can be uh

1327
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,640
very dangerous ecological wise

1328
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,118
um but i mean there's times where some

1329
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,838
biomass can be moved you have to look at

1330
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,720
how it's collected where it's stacked

1331
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:36,480
you know try not to put like a blanket

1332
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,318
rule on this thing where we have to

1333
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,519
sequester carbon we have there's that's

1334
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:41,519
a fact

1335
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,759
and so we have to figure out the

1336
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,239
materials that we can and cannot use and

1337
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,800
there's methods where we can employ that

1338
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,039
convert the biomass right on site

1339
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,760
so there's many ways we can get the

1340
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:56,400
conversion done but maybe not just with

1341
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,119
one particular tool

1342
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,358
so

1343
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,800
all of us who are natural farmers are

1344
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:04,679
very much into imo um

1345
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,960
indigenous microorganisms the

1346
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:08,480
microorganisms that are in your locale

1347
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,639
in your neighborhood they're your

1348
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,800
neighbors and so let's do what we can to

1349
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,838
beef them up and use them in your local

1350
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,480
gardening

1351
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:19,679
and i can imagine that same kind of idea

1352
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,880
might go for uh the the trees and other

1353
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,118
plants that we use to make biochar where

1354
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,720
if if if we're saying like you did in

1355
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,838
the first set that our trees are holding

1356
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:32,480
you know

1357
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,880
memories if you will of how to beat a

1358
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,000
particular pest that it beat several

1359
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,160
years ago

1360
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,800
and you know it's still cellular

1361
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,838
knowledge for the plant

1362
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,559
that that it might make sense to

1363
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,920
focus on making biochar with the kinds

1364
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,800
of plants

1365
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,119
and even source them locally because

1366
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,720
locally sourced plants are going to

1367
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:59,358
provide a biochar that has got

1368
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,239
memory of your area what do you think of

1369
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,679
that

1370
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,479
that's what that's the direction it's

1371
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:06,639
going all the conservation agencies now

1372
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,760
employing the prescription burns that

1373
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:12,480
they call them um forestry groups that

1374
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,319
are doing in place conversions this is

1375
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,800
exactly why

1376
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:19,679
because you can't import those goodies

1377
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,160
they're created on site and must be left

1378
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,159
on site

1379
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,359
it's happening 100 all right cool

1380
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:28,558
all right so let's start let's start

1381
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,199
going through

1382
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:34,559
um a process of

1383
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,118
uh making uh biochar now i've seen

1384
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,359
biochar i mean there may be many ways

1385
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,760
but i've only seen two i've seen people

1386
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:43,679
who dig a hole in the ground

1387
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,880
that's pretty deep and has got pretty

1388
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,558
steep sides and they throw everything

1389
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,440
inside of that and they burn it and then

1390
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,280
i see people who are using

1391
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,119
um

1392
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,240
like uh what do you call those things

1393
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,880
like um

1394
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,919
metal metal things that are round

1395
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,000
kilns

1396
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,599
sure kilns kills

1397
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,280
drums that's what i was looking for kill

1398
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,200
kills is a pretty sexy name i just met

1399
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,640
like i just meant like like oil drum

1400
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:12,399
looking things so uh so so what

1401
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,239
what are

1402
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,358
what which do you prefer and does it

1403
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:16,318
matter

1404
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:18,400
okay

1405
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:22,880
when it comes to making char

1406
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,318
most people on farms are just doing

1407
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,318
burn piles

1408
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,639
you know and they're burning their waste

1409
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:30,719
so what we try to encourage them to do

1410
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,960
instead of just burning their waste if

1411
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:35,919
they employed a different burn technique

1412
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,159
to their traditional burn piles they can

1413
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,400
be left with char the method in which

1414
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,639
we're teaching them is referred to as

1415
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,760
the conservation method

1416
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:49,279
the conservation method is simply when

1417
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,119
you light that pile of biomass and these

1418
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,800
biome you have to check your at your

1419
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,400
local regulations for maximum pile size

1420
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,559
but what you're going to do instead of

1421
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,680
lighting throwing a bunch of gas and

1422
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,680
lagging that pile on fire what you want

1423
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,838
to do is torch the top

1424
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:08,719
you want to put smaller material and

1425
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,599
create a type of a bird's nest if you

1426
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,239
will

1427
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,240
bird's nest where it when you light that

1428
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,759
fire if you light it from the top at

1429
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,598
that bird's nest

1430
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,280
when that little bird's nest starts to

1431
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,599
burn and combust

1432
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,200
it's going to excite the biomass just

1433
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,079
below it

1434
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:28,239
and as it heats up and

1435
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,480
and excites that biomass the gases are

1436
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:32,558
going to come out of the wood and fuel

1437
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,519
that little light on top

1438
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,480
now

1439
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:38,239
as that little light on top is burning

1440
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,039
its smoke is going to you'll notice

1441
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,399
smoke start going into the top of that

1442
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:44,318
toplet fire

1443
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,800
smoke is actually

1444
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:49,199
um combustible and we don't realize that

1445
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,200
when we make our fires but by lighting

1446
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,598
at the top and allowing the smoke to

1447
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:57,039
come back into the flame it's gonna

1448
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:59,440
drive that top fire even hotter so the

1449
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:01,838
more smoke that's coming out it's

1450
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,079
actually the fuel for that fire at the

1451
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,318
top and this is what's so cool about is

1452
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,720
because you don't no longer have those

1453
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:10,400
particulates going up into the air but

1454
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:12,799
coming into the flame front for

1455
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,519
combustion you could reduce the

1456
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,359
particulates from these burn piles where

1457
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,559
you've seen them at the farm smoking out

1458
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,400
all the neighborhood

1459
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,800
but if that smoke is going into the

1460
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,119
flame front driving the combustion that

1461
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,480
chocolate fire is going to get bigger

1462
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:31,119
and bigger and heat that pile up so that

1463
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,400
the volatile gases get released from the

1464
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,960
fire

1465
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,559
killing and combusting all the smoke

1466
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,280
this is where the practice of the ark

1467
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,839
comes in a conservation burn as that

1468
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,920
fire burns that pile down you're going

1469
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:45,599
to notice the white little ash on the

1470
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,119
top of the material

1471
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,039
that's the part where you want to

1472
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,599
extinguish the fire

1473
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:55,119
so that you don't turn the carbon into

1474
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,280
ash the ash is basically oxidized carbon

1475
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,798
but you do want to get the gases out so

1476
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,839
learning when to pull the trigger on

1477
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:01,838
that fire

1478
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,440
takes some practice there's a ton of

1479
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:04,318
really cool videos on youtube where

1480
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,400
people are

1481
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,358
using conservation burn with different

1482
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,599
size piles and materials but you'll be

1483
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,519
able to notice when they cool that fire

1484
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,039
down and this is the part where the

1485
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,960
natural farmers you guys are going to

1486
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:20,000
love because

1487
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,838
when that fire carbon is in flux and in

1488
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,318
heat it basically has a memory that's

1489
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:29,279
neutralized and is pretty much waiting

1490
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:32,079
to receive new information the hotter i

1491
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,720
drive the carbon the more i erase the

1492
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,480
old memory from that now you say well

1493
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:37,919
you said v has a lot of good memory why

1494
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,480
do you want to erase it

1495
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,519
well this case there are times where i

1496
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,760
want to erase some memory from carbon to

1497
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,400
load it up with new memory and the new

1498
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,480
memory is essentially

1499
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,039
all of the great ferments that i've been

1500
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,039
creating and these ferments can be from

1501
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,558
your healthiest plants or like i

1502
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:57,679
mentioned your healthiest parts of the

1503
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,920
soil

1504
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:02,318
if you can record

1505
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,440
that information of healthy soil in a

1506
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:07,838
liquid t form added to your water at the

1507
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,400
cooling process you're going to then add

1508
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:12,880
more memory to that carbon and this is

1509
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,639
where you get even more exciting because

1510
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,680
you are essentially programming the

1511
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:20,318
carbon now when they discovered the

1512
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:24,318
terra preda pits which means um black

1513
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:25,838
earth the biochar pits in 1960 um

1514
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,759
cornell university went down to the

1515
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:30,558
amazon to look at these

1516
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,440
carbon pits that were 10 to 15 feet of

1517
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,240
biochar but alongside them were japanese

1518
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,559
scientists and the japanese scientists

1519
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:41,519
did tests on the biochar that is still

1520
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,319
in america we don't do and they not only

1521
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,679
looked at its physical properties but

1522
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,000
they're very interested in its

1523
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:51,039
electromagnetic properties and in

1524
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,079
particular its potential to cast out

1525
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:56,719
what we know as far infrared far

1526
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:59,519
infrared has the ability to have

1527
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,959
microorganisms self-divine we know that

1528
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,838
as mitosis

1529
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,240
it's a type of uh of a thermal type of a

1530
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,558
heat but at the same time it's also a

1531
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:10,959
vibration it's like hearing your

1532
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,798
favorite songs while you're working and

1533
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,199
this just gets the microbes cooking and

1534
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:18,880
going but when the japanese scientists

1535
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:20,879
left the um left amazon in the 1960s

1536
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,400
they came back and they started playing

1537
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,358
with what we know today as bio ceramics

1538
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,318
and these are simply ceramics silica

1539
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:30,159
quartz

1540
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,079
like the quartz crystal that you you

1541
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:33,920
guys sit around your house or you know

1542
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,640
quartz crystal will grind those down and

1543
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,519
fire them at 2000 degrees to erase the

1544
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:42,159
memory but then cool it they'll cool it

1545
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:45,358
with the em effective microbes and they

1546
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:47,358
create this amazing bio ceramic so japan

1547
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,119
has been playing with many forms of bio

1548
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:52,000
ceramic whether they're mineral

1549
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:54,880
influenced or in dr higa's case with em

1550
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,280
microbial influence but their physical

1551
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,400
ability to cast electromagnetic

1552
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,519
frequency in the far infrared at about

1553
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,760
12 to 15 inches away from the bag

1554
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:06,960
lets you know like we are we know

1555
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,359
nothing about

1556
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,679
uh there's so much more to learn so when

1557
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:13,679
we create our car our our carbon and our

1558
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,440
biochar and we keep in mind that the

1559
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,919
principles that adding in these

1560
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,119
high-power microbial teas are then going

1561
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,519
to create a physical and electromagnetic

1562
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,280
property to the char i hope a grad

1563
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:27,119
student will pick up on

1564
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,440
testing different electromagnetic

1565
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,160
potentials of char created under

1566
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:35,280
different um imo recipes

1567
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:37,440
and different consortias that could

1568
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,119
potentially increase the regeneration

1569
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,599
capacity of soil

1570
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,640
all right so much in what you just said

1571
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,519
so

1572
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:47,358
i'm going to go all the way back to the

1573
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,519
conservation pile

1574
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:52,318
but i want to tell folks that anybody

1575
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:56,079
who was just turned on by this idea of

1576
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:58,480
bio ceramics um i uh i had the

1577
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,359
opportunity of hearing quaterma talk

1578
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,838
about

1579
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:05,679
bio ceramics uh in the past and it it

1580
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:08,078
sounded unreasonable to me and so i

1581
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:11,358
looked it up and the stuff really exists

1582
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,519
and it is very effective and some of the

1583
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:16,880
trials that they have done

1584
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:20,159
just putting bioceramics near other

1585
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,400
products that you know improved their

1586
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,639
like improved taste of wine and things

1587
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,000
like this is like truly amazing you know

1588
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:29,039
oh so we're not we're not gonna we're

1589
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,199
not gonna go down that path today but um

1590
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:33,679
it is it is an amazing truth that that

1591
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,199
you might want to google bio ceramics so

1592
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:37,919
with that said let's let's go all the

1593
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:40,558
way back to the conservation piles and

1594
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,480
um i found it interesting that what you

1595
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,480
know we're going to take our burn pile

1596
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,838
and we're actually really going to just

1597
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,358
make a a small fire at the top of the

1598
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,440
burn pile

1599
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:53,358
instead of just like torching the hell

1600
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,880
out of the entire burn pile at the same

1601
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:57,598
time because what we want to do is

1602
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:01,119
create this physical nature of the pile

1603
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:03,838
where the fire at the top is going to be

1604
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,119
pulling oxygen up through

1605
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:07,358
the

1606
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,680
burn pile and so it's going to be

1607
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:12,000
creating heat and hot more and more heat

1608
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:14,480
in the burn pile but really burning from

1609
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,838
the top so so really the burn pile

1610
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,519
itself becomes a fuel source for this

1611
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:21,199
smaller fire

1612
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,119
that's at the top

1613
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,798
and and then you said well that you know

1614
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,440
it when you're done that's also where

1615
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:29,759
you are going to extinguish your fire

1616
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,599
before it turns to ash

1617
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,520
with water so that you're left with the

1618
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,119
biochar instead of just you know

1619
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:37,280
powdered ash

1620
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:39,599
and and then you said

1621
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,480
take a look on youtube

1622
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,039
for

1623
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,719
videos so that you can get a visual

1624
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,599
representation

1625
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:50,480
of what we want the biochar pile to look

1626
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,760
like when we put it out like like at

1627
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,440
what point do we put it out now now that

1628
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,720
is probably really good advice to turn

1629
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,039
people to youtube to to learn that what

1630
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:04,239
that looks like but if you had to

1631
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:07,358
describe it to us without the video

1632
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:10,719
what would you tell us to look for to

1633
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:13,440
know when to stop that burn pile and we

1634
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:15,039
know we've got biochar and so we don't

1635
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,119
get ash

1636
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:20,400
the pile should be collapsed all the way

1637
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,920
down you should have at least 90 percent

1638
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,079
of the charcoal

1639
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,760
i should start seeing a little bit of

1640
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,160
white ash coming in

1641
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,760
sometimes i use mixed woods so there's

1642
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:30,960
going to be some pieces that still are

1643
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,640
burning

1644
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,400
but um they're not going to have enough

1645
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:37,519
time to convert or i'll lose a bunch of

1646
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,318
the small pieces so looking at what to

1647
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:41,920
separate what to cool i'll even pull off

1648
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,000
some of the bigger pieces sometimes with

1649
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,680
the rake and then move them to the next

1650
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,079
pile because we'll have several piles

1651
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:50,399
going and then at that point once i see

1652
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,920
that pile has collapsed most of it has

1653
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,440
turned white the the um

1654
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,559
the fire should be

1655
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,000
very little if any coming up at all

1656
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,960
that's the point where i want to cool it

1657
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,480
down

1658
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,440
um and that's the part where i hit it

1659
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,880
with water all right fabulous okay so so

1660
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,039
one more thing about the burn pile

1661
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:12,400
before before i move on to holes and

1662
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:15,200
trash cans and that is um this converts

1663
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,760
conservation style burn pile i'm really

1664
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:18,960
surprised that we're making biochar with

1665
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,119
it because

1666
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,838
again and i have very limited experience

1667
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,920
in biochar when i was reading about it

1668
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:28,719
it was saying that one of the

1669
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,519
key aspects of making biochar is that

1670
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:34,639
you're making it in a limited oxygen

1671
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:38,318
environment and that is why people make

1672
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:39,920
it in holes and in um

1673
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:42,960
um

1674
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:46,960
oil drums or other kinds of drums

1675
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:52,000
because when you pack that space

1676
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:54,400
full of wood and then you burn it

1677
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,920
there is an interesting

1678
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,280
[Music]

1679
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:03,440
biological reaction happening in play

1680
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:06,798
because the area is small and and

1681
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:10,798
the wood cannot the fire cannot get all

1682
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:13,679
of the oxygen it wants to have and so it

1683
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:16,079
burns slightly different i um somebody

1684
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:19,199
commented online that that their wood

1685
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,359
can't get or the fire can't get oxygen

1686
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,798
drunk right which while i don't know

1687
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:26,000
what that means scientifically it sounds

1688
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:28,159
really cool um so so

1689
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,519
so what can you tell me about the

1690
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:35,199
importance of limiting oxygen

1691
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:38,639
when making biochar and why doesn't that

1692
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:40,558
really apply to the conservation pile

1693
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,719
style

1694
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:45,200
you'll make a better char for sure the

1695
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:47,038
more oxygen you can limit into it but

1696
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,798
the reality is

1697
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,599
farmers aren't going to use drums you

1698
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:54,559
can't get big farms to dig all these

1699
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:56,880
holes and the amount of man-hours to

1700
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,960
process the char and pits

1701
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,200
it's really not feasible for a lot of

1702
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,679
farms so the first conservation burn

1703
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:06,000
method i described to you is going to be

1704
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:08,318
the crudest way to make char

1705
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,400
but that's the way a lot of big farms

1706
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:11,279
are already burning anyway polluting the

1707
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,960
sky

1708
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,359
can convert piles

1709
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,119
now if you want to make higher quality

1710
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:20,000
char you then are going to move to the

1711
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:22,640
drum technologies where you can get more

1712
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,960
oxygen absent from the process and not

1713
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:28,000
to mention you'll capture a lot more

1714
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,559
char doing it in oxygen deprived

1715
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,440
environments than doing conservation

1716
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,440
burn

1717
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,599
but the conservation burn is just an

1718
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,400
open invite for many farmers who are

1719
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,039
already doing the practice to say hey

1720
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,000
well let me try this out and typically

1721
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:46,160
once they see the results from that char

1722
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,039
naturally you want to make better char

1723
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:52,480
in your next run so that's where the pit

1724
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:54,400
and the drums and the kiln technologies

1725
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,960
start to come into play but the

1726
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,119
conservation burn is my my gateway

1727
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,798
carbon uh entry point all right to get

1728
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,760
farmers to use fantastic good

1729
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:06,159
explanation all right so so so we've

1730
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,240
gone through the gateway and if we if

1731
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:09,838
we've got a bigger farm you know we're

1732
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:12,959
starting to make our piles and we're all

1733
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:15,199
like biochar hell yeah this is great or

1734
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,199
you're a smaller farmer right you're

1735
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:20,239
you're a craft hobbyist you're a home

1736
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:21,759
grower you know where where

1737
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:23,519
we love our cannabis and we want it to

1738
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,520
be high-end and

1739
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,280
um i mean hell i've got i've got such a

1740
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:29,119
small property it would it would take me

1741
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,359
a whole summer to put together that much

1742
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,240
biomass because you know i don't have a

1743
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:36,400
big-ass farm so so let's talk about like

1744
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:40,399
you know level two of

1745
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:44,720
of using a a drum so would you describe

1746
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:47,358
how to do a drum process

1747
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:49,439
so typically with the drum we have um

1748
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,598
one drum in which your feed stock that

1749
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,798
you want to make the char with go

1750
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:57,359
you put all your material into one drum

1751
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:59,440
with holes in that container and then

1752
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:02,960
that drum typically goes into another

1753
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,960
drum and on the outside of in between

1754
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,280
the drums are going to fill with biomass

1755
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,000
and different wood materials

1756
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,319
that then get combusted

1757
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,880
and as the fire burns it draws out the

1758
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:18,318
volatile gases from the interior drum

1759
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,760
leaving you behind with the um with pure

1760
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:21,759
carbon

1761
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,480
typically a lot of people use this

1762
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:27,039
method they can get very smoky but you

1763
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,798
create very good char this way but just

1764
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,480
takes a super long time

1765
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,400
yeah you got to find two different sizes

1766
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,798
of drums i mean yeah even that sounds

1767
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,639
like a pain in the ass all right so so

1768
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:39,440
like let's let's imagine that you have

1769
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:42,159
found these two metal drums one bigger

1770
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,920
than the other slightly um you said

1771
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,920
they've got holes drilled in them where

1772
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,480
are we drilling the holes you're going

1773
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,559
to put them on to the side and then down

1774
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,719
on the bottom so you can get a nice

1775
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,480
draft coming up from from the bottom of

1776
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:56,719
the of the drum so

1777
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,480
so like you know a handful of drilled

1778
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,318
holes in the sides but then a whole

1779
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,719
bunch at the bottom because the idea is

1780
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:04,639
that it's sucking in

1781
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,719
the oxygen at the bottom

1782
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,639
correct but you also got to make sure

1783
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:10,639
you have enough holes to release the

1784
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:11,759
volatile gases as well

1785
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:14,639
so it's

1786
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,559
to me i think this is probably my least

1787
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,318
favorite way to make char

1788
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,319
because of all the

1789
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:22,239
complications involved of

1790
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:23,920
making sure my holes are the right size

1791
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,078
sometimes they put too many in but

1792
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,480
that's the only draw you have

1793
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,000
so it just seems like it's

1794
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,920
it's a it's a tougher learning um

1795
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,880
learning curve with with that particular

1796
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,880
style the pitch char would be you know

1797
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,240
my second favorite all right let's let's

1798
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,280
talk about that

1799
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:43,038
break it down

1800
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,440
so the pitch are you're going to dig

1801
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,760
yourself a hole into the ground and you

1802
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,559
kind of want to cone out the shapes if

1803
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,359
you look

1804
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:54,240
on your on your pit that you make so you

1805
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:56,078
can have a little a little edge around

1806
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,719
the outside of that pit so air can come

1807
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,640
in and out of the pit but the trick is

1808
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:04,078
when you light that pit you want to

1809
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:06,159
stack your wood above the ground

1810
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:08,960
so you're about a foot and a half above

1811
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:11,598
that ground level and same thing light

1812
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:14,079
at the top if you light your pit chart

1813
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,880
at the top your combustion rates gonna

1814
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,600
be

1815
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,880
super quick but the best part about the

1816
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:23,440
char pit is you can once you get the

1817
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:26,560
fire up and going and burning i can keep

1818
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:29,519
adding biomass to that pit and as i'm

1819
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:32,000
adding the biomass to the burn pile it's

1820
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,400
suffocating the coals underneath

1821
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,600
you can create a lot of char pretty

1822
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:38,479
quick it's a beautiful slow kind of a

1823
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,798
burn

1824
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,039
but you can just keep stacking into the

1825
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:44,798
hole as to where conservation burn

1826
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,319
you're limited to the pile you can't

1827
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:48,479
keep adding to it

1828
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,159
the pitch are you can keep adding

1829
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,399
biomass and create quite a bit of

1830
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:54,479
biomass in a short amount of time and

1831
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,879
the quality is just so beautiful and

1832
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:00,959
because you've got so much uh wood

1833
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,000
material burning and the hole is deep

1834
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,119
and and

1835
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,119
and

1836
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:08,000
i guess you'd be limiting the oxygen

1837
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:10,238
right so so you've got the wood that's

1838
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,479
got this slow and steady burn because

1839
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:15,439
it's not allowed to get like all out of

1840
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:18,399
control because the oxygen is limited so

1841
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:21,838
so there is our advantage to limiting

1842
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:25,838
the oxygen is so that we get a a slow

1843
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:28,318
and low long char instead of uh here's a

1844
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:31,278
bunch of oxygen and just have it go ape

1845
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,279
and and then like just burn to ash

1846
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,880
yeah and that's exactly how they feel

1847
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,279
too when you're burning those things the

1848
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,759
conservation burn is like mad and just

1849
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,440
roaring but i mean you know in a

1850
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,920
vineyard when they got 20 foot piles

1851
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,439
where they usually take all day for

1852
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,480
three and four days even sometimes to

1853
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,960
burn

1854
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,798
that aggressive high temperature burn is

1855
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,399
nice because it's only three hours yeah

1856
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,679
but the pitch are

1857
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:58,399
super nice super slow good quality and

1858
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:00,319
it's even once you get the fire nice i

1859
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,119
can even throw in a little bit wetter

1860
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:04,000
wood

1861
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:05,840
because it's just going to combust all

1862
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,158
within the heat so i can

1863
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,159
convert more biomass

1864
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:12,960
you know that's probably not favorable

1865
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:17,119
because of that nice calm high heat from

1866
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:20,239
all right hr so so you know it scaling

1867
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:22,640
up like making more biochar once you're

1868
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:25,839
already kind of sold and successful

1869
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,600
um is easier than probably doing it the

1870
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:31,039
very first time when you've got to learn

1871
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,520
how to do it so so if if if we are for

1872
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:36,319
this example let's say that we're we're

1873
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,159
just talking about a home cultivator

1874
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:40,079
let's say that they're just like doing

1875
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:43,119
20 plants or something

1876
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:47,039
and um they want to produce biochar for

1877
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:48,079
the summer um how big and how deep of a

1878
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,039
hole

1879
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:50,880
um

1880
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:52,399
is reasonable

1881
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,000
like you know i've seen lots of

1882
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:56,158
different holes i mean i see some people

1883
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,640
who are using freaking backhoes for them

1884
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:00,399
and then i see like nick risden who just

1885
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,039
spent an afternoon digging a freaking

1886
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:04,960
hole that he can stand up in and making

1887
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:07,039
biochar and that and not using the big

1888
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,760
old backhoe so like like give us a

1889
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:11,439
little idea of of what this hole is like

1890
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,119
and i'd like you to talk about that ring

1891
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:14,639
around the top that you said that helps

1892
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:18,079
bring in oxygen because i didn't i

1893
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,560
didn't follow that okay so um man i got

1894
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:23,119
people making the pits as small as like

1895
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,239
a barbecue pit oh you know the weber

1896
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,719
size

1897
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:28,718
so you people even making it in practice

1898
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,198
it in the weber they can make small

1899
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:33,439
piles and get the skill down

1900
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:35,519
and then you know get it figured out

1901
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,279
on a small scale but it doesn't need to

1902
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,480
be big at all

1903
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,639
they can be

1904
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,959
just the size of a weber and that's

1905
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,960
great for a small cultivator but what

1906
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,719
i'm saying about the sides

1907
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,198
instead of having the sides of when you

1908
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,319
dig your hole being straight down into

1909
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:52,639
the floor

1910
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:53,599
if you can kind of angle that to the

1911
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,800
floor

1912
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,800
so you're kind of at a um 45 and it

1913
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,679
opens up if you look at something called

1914
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,320
a tiki khan kiln you'll see the shape of

1915
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,800
the tiki khan kiln or what's referred to

1916
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:09,198
as the oregon kiln and how it's kind of

1917
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,119
vertically shaped that's the slant size

1918
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:13,599
that we need um

1919
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:15,439
for for that type of burn i understand

1920
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,480
what you're saying so so even though we

1921
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:21,919
are making these slanted sides we're not

1922
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:24,718
filling up these slanted sides with

1923
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:27,359
material we're actually just still

1924
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,198
stacking up our biochar kind of as a

1925
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:31,679
center column

1926
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:34,158
and and these sides that are at 45

1927
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,640
degrees are not filled with wood and

1928
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,879
that just allows some oxygen to get down

1929
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,880
into our hole correct all right that's

1930
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,119
going to be airflow yep got it all right

1931
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,199
so does this 45 degrees go all the way

1932
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:47,599
to our bottom or is it just like you

1933
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:50,639
know the top third no it goes from top

1934
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:53,120
to bottom okay so so all right so so

1935
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,600
that tells me that like in my head i was

1936
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,840
imagining building a pit that's like you

1937
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,440
know up to my neck right

1938
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,760
that that would take out that would be a

1939
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:05,439
big because because you'd have

1940
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:08,159
to go 45 degrees all the way down to

1941
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:11,119
five or six feet of depth and that's a

1942
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:13,119
really big hole nah just even think of

1943
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:14,479
campfire and it's actually cool because

1944
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:16,719
your family would love if you made a new

1945
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:19,039
campfire spot out there it doesn't need

1946
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,319
to be bigger than campfire size but just

1947
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:22,079
the way you describe how you're going to

1948
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,920
stack your wood that's going to be the

1949
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,760
trick you don't fill the thing up but

1950
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,520
you make that center column style all

1951
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,600
right so like a three by three hole is

1952
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,360
probably all i need for my whole year

1953
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,560
especially especially if i'm going to be

1954
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:33,599
adding

1955
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,320
more

1956
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:39,280
material as it's burning yeah you're

1957
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:41,759
right plenty of char all right um

1958
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:45,119
this hole and and we've got we've we

1959
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:48,400
started the fire at the top and um it's

1960
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:51,119
you know it's it's it's it's

1961
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:53,439
decreasing the amount of oxygen in the

1962
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:55,439
in the deeper parts of the hole uh and

1963
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:57,119
yet we're still getting good air flow

1964
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:59,678
you know a little bit of airflow from

1965
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,920
the 45 degree walls and it's clocking

1966
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:05,600
along and we're throwing in some

1967
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,399
additional biochar occasionally um uh

1968
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,880
are we are we just leaving the top open

1969
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:12,559
or are we covering it at all

1970
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,400
um to extinguish

1971
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,480
no no while it's burning

1972
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:19,198
yeah so the trick is

1973
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:20,879
you wanna and it's even referred to as a

1974
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,599
flame on the cap

1975
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,520
you wanna make sure you keep a flame on

1976
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,360
the cap of that pit

1977
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,120
because if that flame is what's going to

1978
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:30,880
do all your conversion

1979
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:34,000
and that flame is actually going to keep

1980
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,279
oxygen out of your carbon as well

1981
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,840
so

1982
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:39,119
keeping if you look at flame cap kilns

1983
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,440
or flame cap

1984
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:44,399
pits you'll see how they maintain it

1985
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:46,719
with the the flame on top

1986
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,559
and that's gonna be your key

1987
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,239
so you may need to add in different size

1988
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,600
materials at different times of the

1989
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:55,599
combustion to maintain that ring all the

1990
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,560
way around the top that ring of fire on

1991
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,600
the top

1992
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,039
and

1993
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:04,400
that's going to be your converting um

1994
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:07,198
feedstock into into biochar why doesn't

1995
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:09,359
the flame that that that cap flame why

1996
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:12,960
doesn't it work its way all the way down

1997
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:15,439
so that i've got this like total pyre

1998
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,279
as it's releasing gases from the wood

1999
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:19,279
and meeting the oxygen that's our

2000
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,359
combustion point there

2001
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:23,119
so it doesn't never oxygen doesn't make

2002
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:25,839
its way down into the carbon for

2003
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:25,840
oxidation

2004
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,800
yeah wow this is a real badass skill to

2005
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,800
learn

2006
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,560
it's so much fun

2007
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,600
all right so um

2008
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,840
all right so i do want to go back to the

2009
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,000
like while we didn't really dig the drum

2010
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,600
version i do want to ask one question

2011
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,079
that's uh burning good pun um in my mind

2012
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,159
and and that is you said that we've got

2013
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:50,399
the two different sizes of drum and

2014
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:53,359
we've got uh burning material in the

2015
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:57,920
center but we've also got wood material

2016
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:58,719
between the two uh layers of drum

2017
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,399
um

2018
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:04,399
is the

2019
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:06,559
like are are both the interior and are

2020
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:09,198
both sets of wood going to be used as

2021
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,880
biochar or is only one of those sets of

2022
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:12,799
wood going to become bio char good

2023
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,960
question only one the one in the

2024
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,480
interior drum on the inside

2025
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,560
the uh so what's the stuff on the

2026
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:20,639
outside for it that's the that's the

2027
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:23,039
heat that's gonna then excite the

2028
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,280
volatile gases from the interior drum

2029
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:26,079
and get it to release

2030
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:28,158
um

2031
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,840
without actually being exposed to the

2032
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:31,920
fire all right cool that's good enough

2033
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,159
and and you know since it really does

2034
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,039
make sense that the vast majority of us

2035
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:39,519
are probably either going to dig a hole

2036
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,920
or do a conservation burn we're not

2037
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,280
going to go in to do the uh drum within

2038
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,560
drum version anymore and and you know if

2039
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:50,319
if we have excited you know listeners to

2040
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,679
like go find out more you and i have

2041
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:55,759
done our job right um but as far as as

2042
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,760
far as getting you to teach it um i

2043
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,520
think that people generally understand

2044
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,520
what the drum version would be like and

2045
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,560
if they want to explore that there's um

2046
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,239
you know

2047
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,239
there's there's lots of youtube videos

2048
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:09,759
online all right so let's talk about uh

2049
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:11,039
the end process so um it's been going

2050
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,800
for a while we've got this very

2051
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:17,439
successful burn

2052
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:20,800
um uh and and um we have decided it's

2053
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,198
time to um put it out because the

2054
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,760
material is starting it has has

2055
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:28,000
collapsed and some of the smaller stuff

2056
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:31,280
is starting to get a little ashy

2057
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,439
and we want to put it out um

2058
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,119
do we just like put water on it how do

2059
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:37,759
we put it out

2060
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:40,559
yeah so we're extinguishing with water

2061
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,960
and keeping a rake handy you'll have to

2062
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,600
water down the pile and kind of rake the

2063
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,279
coals around because they there's just

2064
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,079
layers and layers of charcoal under

2065
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:50,719
there

2066
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:52,960
and the bottom layer will stay hot even

2067
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,560
though it appears like it's out so

2068
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,319
keeping a rake as you're cooling that

2069
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,280
char down

2070
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:01,439
it's going to allow that fire to go out

2071
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,880
and maintain the carbon

2072
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,319
but if you don't put that thing out

2073
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,679
right you know you'll come the next day

2074
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:07,679
and everything will turn to ash even

2075
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:10,079
though you thought for sure the fire had

2076
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,158
went out oh you'd be so sad yeah i'm

2077
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:14,000
gonna do it all over again

2078
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:15,759
lots of water and all that water gets

2079
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,520
soaked back into the char too so it's

2080
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,679
not like you're wasting any water at all

2081
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,560
right so so the water is definitely uh

2082
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:23,600
you know you you can't use too much

2083
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,560
correct the

2084
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,079
char is very hydrophobic at first so

2085
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,120
it's nice to actually give it a nice

2086
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:30,800
soaking

2087
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:33,599
that water then is going to start to

2088
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:36,960
attract the life forms that you need to

2089
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,880
charge up that char or get it inhabited

2090
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,960
so the cooling part

2091
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,800
is super important and so then we just

2092
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,079
leave it in the hole overnight and we

2093
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,760
walk away

2094
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:47,519
or you can pull it out if it's cool put

2095
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,400
it in storage containers

2096
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,239
um

2097
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:52,719
but typically people just leave it until

2098
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:54,879
the next day all right so next day

2099
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:57,359
we look in our hole we've got all this

2100
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,079
biochar we're we're going like hell yeah

2101
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:02,719
guadamuck totally hooked me up um i'm so

2102
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:04,880
glad i know this skill and so like now

2103
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:07,198
now what do we do with it um we'll we'll

2104
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,119
talk more in the next set about like

2105
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:11,439
when do we want big pieces and when do

2106
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:14,079
we want little pieces but what i'm more

2107
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:16,000
asking you is storage like like what

2108
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:19,760
what do i actually do with that stuff do

2109
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,840
i do i go stack it do i do i put it in

2110
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,520
some kind of a bin like like how do we

2111
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,880
keep this stuff until we're ready to use

2112
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,719
it

2113
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,520
now you can keep that thing in a pile

2114
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,840
outside um

2115
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,360
near you know anywhere near soil and the

2116
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,039
soils and microbes are going to start

2117
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:36,960
being attracted to it

2118
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,319
um so i kind of like to leave it out and

2119
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,640
open like that it doesn't sound like we

2120
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:42,399
have to protect it then no no you want

2121
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,920
things to come to it oh right you know

2122
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:44,879
yeah so it's usually going to house good

2123
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,520
things

2124
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,319
um yeah it actually is kind of becoming

2125
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:53,520
it's attracting imo at that point 100

2126
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:55,920
right right on all right okay cool so

2127
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,920
let's wrap up this set here and when we

2128
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,840
come back we'll start talking about how

2129
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,079
to use this stuff uh what a great

2130
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,840
episode all right so we're going to take

2131
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:05,679
our second of two short breaks and be

2132
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,000
right back you are listening to shaping

2133
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:10,480
fire and my guest today is koatta mcvea

2134
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,479
hell yeah

2135
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,678
a fully functioning greenhouse grows

2136
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,239
extraordinary cannabis flowers that have

2137
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:21,039
exceptional bag appeal great terpene

2138
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:23,119
profiles and exceptional yield

2139
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,760
but as we have discussed many times on

2140
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:28,158
shaping fire a greenhouse is only as

2141
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,400
good as the environment you create for

2142
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:32,638
the plants inside

2143
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:34,799
biotherm has been on the forefront of

2144
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:37,119
developing and installing highly

2188
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,920
one of the challenges with buying

2189
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,238
autoflower seeds is that often you'll

2190
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,639
have as many different phenos as you

2191
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:27,279
will have seeds in a pack that can be

2192
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,600
fun sure but so many varieties in one

2193
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:31,759
pack is a sign of an immature seed line

2194
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,840
that hasn't been worked enough

2195
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,440
i prefer my autoflowers to be worked

2196
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,440
enough that each pheno in the pack

2197
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:39,839
really captures the aspects that the

2198
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:42,799
breeder was intending

2199
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,560
this is why i recommend gnome automatics

tested in a wide range of conditions and

2206
01:22:56,238 --> 01:23:01,678
taken to a level of maturity that each

2207
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:03,919

2208
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:07,039

i'm gonna want to put it in my like

2310
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,039
simple ornamentals right so so let's

2311
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:54,559
let's let's

2312
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:57,359
let's start at the top you know i'm

2313
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,320
imagine when you're done with um with a

2314
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:01,599
burn

2315
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:04,559
that that you are seeing these different

2316
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,199
sizes and you are starting to think

2317
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,280
about what's going to be used for what

2318
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:11,039
can you kind of walk us through your

2319
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:14,880
thought process when you're looking at

2320
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:17,359
this this pile of various sizes

2321
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,920
yeah so before i was really anxious to

2322
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:21,920
crush it on make it all the same size

2323
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:24,079
but later on i started to realize how

2324
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,520
good it was to have different sizes in

2325
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:26,399
my soil

2326
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,880
um

2327
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:31,359
so i kind of leave i do crush a little

2328
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,600
bit but i leave it mainly in its raw

2329
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:34,250
form it falls apart pretty good as we

2330
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,079
handle it

2331
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,679
[Music]

2332
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,519
so um

2333
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,800
let's say that we're doing a huge let's

2334
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,880
start at the biggest size um

2335
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:46,000
[Music]

2336
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:48,560
are you satisfied just for putting your

2337
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,238
your big ass pieces your branches or

2338
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:57,039
whatever in there or do you want to have

2339
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:58,638
a variety of sizes in every growing

2340
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:59,519
environment

2341
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,079
um

2342
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,800
just based on the size that you're into

2343
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:08,079
like like you know small medium small

2344
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:10,000
medium or in large pieces but scaled to

2345
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:11,600
whatever you're growing in

2346
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,238
yeah hugo mounds are one of those

2347
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:16,719
recipients where they can actually take

2348
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:18,959
any size and we actually the pieces i

2349
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:20,800
mentioned that don't quite burn

2350
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,119
but you can tell they've been charged

2351
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:25,440
just and need more time they're actually

2352
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:27,359
some of the best in the hugo mound

2353
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:29,119
so for the hugo mounds i find them the

2354
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:32,079
most forgiving for all the different

2355
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:34,479
sizes it's when we get into the pots and

2356
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:35,840
containers where i try to stay towards

2357
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:37,599
the smaller

2358
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,000
pieces of char

2359
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:42,560
so those those big thick pieces that

2360
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,719
didn't fully get charged up they you

2361
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,880
know there's they still got hard centers

2362
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:49,198
um we should we shouldn't feel bad about

2363
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,520
that that that is going to bring its own

2364
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:53,519
set of advantages to the party and we

2365
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:56,320
certainly shouldn't like ignore it or

2366
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,800
not include it um it's just going to be

2367
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:00,479
helping in a different way

2368
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,199
yeah it's going to be half google and

2369
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:05,439
half biochar but still contributing to

2370
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:07,198
the system and these are the pieces

2371
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:09,039
where typically we don't know what to do

2372
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:10,960
with them they're not quite char and

2373
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:13,439
they're still kind of woody so the

2374
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,719
mounds just take them and do wonderful

2375
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:17,519
things with them all right cool um

2376
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:22,079
when

2377
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:23,600
we are putting the biochar into

2378
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:24,880
assuming that we have dug into the

2379
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,960
ground a little bit because like i know

2380
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,560
that some people just make hugel mounds

2381
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,480
and they don't dig in but but i'm

2382
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,679
picturing some amount of digging into

2383
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:33,039
the ground

2384
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:37,520
um

2385
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:40,079
what ratio of the biochar do we want to

2386
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:43,920
have in that hole

2387
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:46,479
you want to go anywhere between 5 and 15

2388
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:50,719
depends on how much you have okay so is

2389
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:52,718
this a a situation where up to 15

2390
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,520
more is better

2391
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,279
no

2392
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,000
um

2393
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:00,158
yeah no not at all

2394
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,679
um so

2395
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:03,439
so

2396
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:05,119
how how should we decide whether or not

2397
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:06,719
we want to do use five percent or

2398
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:08,880
fifteen percent like if i have enough to

2399
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,639
do fifteen percent should i always do

2400
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,039
fifteen percent and stop at that or are

2401
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:15,279
there ever any times where like no

2402
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:17,039
because i'm using this other thing i

2403
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:19,279
should only use five

2404
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:20,880
no i'm just mostly charged so expensive

2405
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:22,479
people don't have it in abundance like

2406
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,840
that all right well let's let's say that

2407
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:25,599
like you've made your own right so

2408
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,319
you're biochar rich

2409
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,679
um you know we would our we would want

2410
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:30,880
to use 15

2411
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:32,239
it sounds like

2412
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,679
yeah 15

2413
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:34,559
allows

2414
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:37,119
for

2415
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,880
like sometimes if you go too much char

2416
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:39,840
there's this weird little adjustment

2417
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,600
period

2418
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:45,679
depending on the kind of char that you

2419
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,960
have soil types i just found like 15

2420
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,560
on the max

2421
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,480
just allows for

2422
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,039
good soil development

2423
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:55,359
and not robbing from the host and allows

2424
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:57,439
me and like i'm always planting as soon

2425
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:58,639
as i use the char some people some

2426
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:00,879
people don't do that and especially like

2427
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,639
google mountains you know i think if we

2428
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:04,400
use the right biology

2429
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,319
i always plant in my hugo mounds as soon

2430
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:08,559
as we create them and a lot of people

2431
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:10,559
this they say no you can't do that

2432
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,800
so these are the kind of things where i

2433
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:16,080
found 15 allows me to develop the

2434
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:19,199
ecology i need for that first season and

2435
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:20,559
just keeps me in a good position for

2436
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:22,479
food production for that year or

2437
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:25,520
medicine right on you know i've heard

2438
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:27,119
that often myself people say oh i i just

2439
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,880
built this huge culture so we're not

2440
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:31,198
gonna use it this year we're gonna use

2441
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,560
it next year but then i've had like a

2442
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:34,638
lot of friends who like build their

2443
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,280
hugel culture and they're all like well

2444
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:39,279
you know sure it'll be better next year

2445
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:41,359
but like let's plan it this year and

2446
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:43,599
like get it going and get it primed and

2447
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:45,759
then they grow these like insane plants

2448
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,600
that are just incredible and they're

2449
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,520
like uh see you know it's gonna be even

2450
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,679
better last year but i'm glad i'm glad i

2451
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,639
used it this year so so you are

2452
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:57,760
definitely of on team user google call

2453
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:59,520
or use your hugelkultur with biochar

2454
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,280
like as soon as you make it

2455
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,440
yeah and that's because of the microbes

2456
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:06,079
that i enlist to help me on that if i

2457
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:08,399
was relying on the natural breakdown

2458
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:10,800
microbes they could lock out a lot of

2459
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:14,238
things from my from my garden but since

2460
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,600
i'm an em bokachi guy i use a lot of k f

2461
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,198
stuff

2462
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,199
i know a lot of the drops i'm doing

2463
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:21,519
they're going right in and plus we got

2464
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:23,759
you know foliage uh

2465
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,520
treatments that you know on arsenal so

2466
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,760
these things allow

2467
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,560
for my plant to uptake

2468
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:32,800
and for biology to break down without

2469
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:35,120
growing thermophilic or these other

2470
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,119
pathways with all of the wood in the in

2471
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:39,039
the soil could potentially take it right

2472
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:40,639
on that makes a lot of sense so

2473
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:44,600
since you are

2474
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:47,520
um an effective farmer using effective

2475
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:50,880
microorganisms um you're you're actually

2476
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:52,960
using a lot of the playbook of our

2477
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:56,719
natural farming that helps get your

2478
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,840
hugel culture up to speed super fast

2479
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,439
100

2480
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,480
and same concept too like with char

2481
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:02,879
you're going to read on char where

2482
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:05,919
they're like don't use it raw but with

2483
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,800
that same concept if i'm feeding my char

2484
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,119
raw

2485
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,840
the same way i'm doing my mounds and

2486
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:14,800
those first three four five waterings

2487
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:17,520
are a nice tea that i know have been bio

2488
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:20,560
or bio available for my plant i don't

2489
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:23,760
have to wait before the charging period

2490
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,920
it's all being created naturally and

2491
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,159
since the ems are just essentially

2492
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,639
feeding the imo's for the area

2493
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:32,158
i'm really drawing them into the char i

2494
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,480
could do a lot of things where they tell

2495
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:36,638
you you can't do it with raw char but

2496
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:39,519
because of the partnership with specific

2497
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:40,800
microbes and and those goodies

2498
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,040
you're able to get away with a lot of

2499
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:46,079
things what i i don't think i understand

2500
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:47,198
what raw char is versus r not raw char

2501
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:49,679
so raw char is what they're going to

2502
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:51,039
describe if you just burnt the biomass

2503
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:53,520
you got the honeycomb structure you

2504
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:54,719
cooled it there's really nobody living

2505
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,080
in there yet

2506
01:33:54,719 --> 01:34:00,319
so when they say raw char and i you

2507
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,639
picture the honeycomb structure as

2508
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:04,719
apartment buildings you gotta move in

2509
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,480
things to those apartment buildings and

2510
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:09,439
once the microorganisms have moved in

2511
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:12,158
they consider that charged char all

2512
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:14,879
right all right so yeah all right so um

2513
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:16,079
what do you find as being best practices

2514
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,719
for

2515
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:20,719
uh charging your char i can imagine that

2516
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,039
you know earlier we talked about just

2517
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:25,920
leaving your biochar out and it'll

2518
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:29,039
naturally gather imo and that's badass

2519
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:32,480
um i can imagine that um

2520
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:34,719
that's you know spraying an imo solution

2521
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:36,158
on it that you have prior made that that

2522
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,719
sounds like a probably a pretty

2523
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:39,679
reasonable thing like what else we got

2524
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,600
so

2525
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,279
molasses is going to attract in the

2526
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,360
goodies right add a little bit of

2527
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:47,439
molasses to your water when you water

2528
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:50,238
and then just straining out compost get

2529
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:52,879
a bag of compost make a fill it with a

2530
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:55,759
sock you do the tea bag extraction and

2531
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:57,920
getting those goodies from the compost

2532
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,119
because it's already bio-available

2533
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,719
you're going to know your plants have

2534
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:02,319
the goodies that they need and then all

2535
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,158
of that's going to move into the

2536
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:05,679
honeycomb structure of the char and we

2537
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:08,638
just want to spray it on right we don't

2538
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:11,679
want to dip the biochar into

2539
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:13,520
the compost water or anything because

2540
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:15,440
that wouldn't be an application if you

2541
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:18,239
were just made biochar and you want to

2542
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,839
use it like right now and mix with soil

2543
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:22,479
that would do that's what we would call

2544
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:24,239
raw or if you wanted the top dress with

2545
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:25,919
the char you have your gardens already

2546
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:28,638
up and going but you still want to add

2547
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,880
char you can add char to the surface but

2548
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:33,279
then water in with a compost tea and

2549
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:35,359
then that will begin to get the char

2550
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:38,960
part of the system i can imagine that if

2551
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:41,920
you're gonna top dress with a biochar

2552
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:43,920
um you're gonna want to

2553
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:47,118
also top that

2554
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:49,840
with soil or compost because isn't

2555
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:51,118
biochar it's most effective when it is

2556
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,760
kept

2557
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:56,880
moist right so so having it on the top

2558
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:59,520
where it's wet dry wet dry every day as

2559
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:01,760
it gets as it gets watered

2560
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:04,320
um it's going to be harder for microbes

2561
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:07,199
to establish i can imagine and so but if

2562
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:09,118
you if you cap it with some compost well

2563
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,118
then now it's under the compost and it's

2564
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:13,439
going to stay moist all the time

2565
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:15,920
yeah but evaporation is going to come up

2566
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:18,158
through the top so if you are on top it

2567
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,079
still does get some moisture but

2568
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:22,559
scratching that thing right into this on

2569
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:24,719
the surface gets it down gets it down

2570
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:28,000
into the playing field

2571
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:30,560
so um keeping that in mind but if you've

2572
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,158
got slugs and things like that that are

2573
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,920
eating your plants

2574
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:35,359
leaving the bigger chunks on the top and

2575
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,600
around the plant they don't like to

2576
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:39,439
crawl up it's scratchy yeah it's very

2577
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:41,600
scratchy so there's times where we'll

2578
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:43,839
top dress but big chunk

2579
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,320
around the base of the plants to keep

2580
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:47,760
crawly things off of them man biochar is

2581
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,639
like a like a

2582
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,280
do everything member of your garden

2583
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:56,239
100 um all right so let's talk about uh

2584
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:59,118
containers now um we i have an idea of

2585
01:36:56,238 --> 01:37:02,399
how much to use at up to 15 percent five

2586
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:04,238
to fifteen percent in our hugels is

2587
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:06,799
are those numbers you know about the

2588
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:08,879
same for containers or do we do we need

2589
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,400
to adapt for some reason

2590
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:14,560
um every soil type's going to be

2591
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:17,118
different but typically i'll run between

2592
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,239
three percent and a 10 for container

2593
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:20,799
gardening

2594
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:22,000
but i'm also watering during my growing

2595
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,960
cycle

2596
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,639
with

2597
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,399
like you can take that char that you

2598
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:28,960
have and make extracts too with that

2599
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:31,439
thing so you get just the dust particles

2600
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,880
so there's a lot of times where

2601
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:34,960
it seems like you have less at the

2602
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,159
initial start but if you're continually

2603
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,840
adding in

2604
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:39,279
with your drops

2605
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,520
your plants are going to love it but

2606
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:45,039
you're building up the carbon the

2607
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:47,760
electricity um energy of that soil so

2608
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:50,880
keep it in mind add it in all not just a

2609
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:53,280
one-time drop go micronized on that go

2610
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,760
top dress on it but always think about

2611
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:58,399
your soil is draining the plants growing

2612
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,600
bigger the energy is going somewhere so

2613
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:01,599
you're going to have to recharge that

2614
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,520
and carbon's going to be that recharger

2615
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,760
all right all right now let's talk about

2616
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,840
really small pots so let's talk about my

2617
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,840
small ornamentals like my my flowering

2618
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,840
plants that i'm not going to smoke on my

2619
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,760
deck right stuff that's stuff that's

2620
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:17,279
there to you know look pretty for me my

2621
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:19,760
doll is and stuff like that um uh you

2622
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:21,920
know is it is it the same same kind of

2623
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,280
thing three to three to five percent and

2624
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,960
five percent typically you're good at

2625
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:26,559
the house plant they don't need there's

2626
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,719
not a lot happening right you might have

2627
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,639
like a crazy house plant but you get

2628
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:32,560
them to flower some stuff like you you

2629
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,000
haven't seen them throw flower before

2630
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,440
they'll flower right up when you when

2631
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,960
you charm up and it's like wow i didn't

2632
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:38,399
even know you made a flower well that

2633
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,319
that now that sounds like an advantage

2634
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:42,000
for us in the pacific northwest right

2635
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:43,599
yeah i got a lot of flowering plants

2636
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,560
that don't like to live here

2637
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:49,440
so um all right so so let's talk about

2638
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:53,119
getting them getting the biochar small

2639
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:54,879
and then this micronizing right so so

2640
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:57,279
you you were very clear with us that

2641
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,600
it's good to have biochar pieces in a

2642
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:02,158
variety of sizes

2643
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:05,600
so that it can be host to

2644
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:07,839
a variety of types of microbes and you

2645
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,560
know just play more like a more variety

2646
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:13,119
of roles in in the substrate so that's

2647
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:15,679
great but let's say that we do want to

2648
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:18,399
get it small like maybe we want small

2649
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:21,279
pieces to top dress so that we're

2650
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:23,839
discouraging slugs or maybe we want to

2651
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:26,158
get it small because we want to put a

2652
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,760
little bit in you know a favorite house

2653
01:39:26,158 --> 01:39:28,559
plant of ours

2654
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,600
or

2655
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,039
or

2656
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,760
you know maybe we want to get it small

2657
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:37,920
because we want to put it in the bag

2658
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:40,719
with our compost tea um how do we make

2659
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:43,440
biochar smaller

2660
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:45,600
no fancy technology man we we get a

2661
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:47,519
bucket sometimes and just mash it up in

2662
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,400
the bucket in two weeks like with a

2663
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,400
hammer

2664
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,319
you know with a shovel that the tips of

2665
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:54,799
your shovels can break that thing down

2666
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:57,679
um sometimes we'll put it in between

2667
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:00,480
um pie boards four by pie boards and

2668
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:02,319
then as you drive your machines around

2669
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:04,799
the farm you can crush it in between

2670
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,880
there back and forth uh-huh and then

2671
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,239
i've seen some of my friends their wives

2672
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,400
don't like it but they'll put it in the

2673
01:40:08,238 --> 01:40:11,759
driveway and just drive over it for a

2674
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:13,118
while yeah

2675
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,199
it slowly just crushes through your

2676
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:17,198
day-to-day activities and

2677
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:19,279
yes so there's really no fancy way to

2678
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:21,198
all right there's no trick to it

2679
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:23,519
i get it cement mixer my friend did a

2680
01:40:21,198 --> 01:40:25,118
cement mixer where he put in trailer

2681
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:28,000
hitch balls and let that thing run for a

2682
01:40:25,118 --> 01:40:29,198
while and that broke it up kind of nice

2683
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,359
so

2684
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:34,238
so like for me i've got access to lots

2685
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:36,319
of uh burlap coffee bags right and so i

2686
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:39,039
can see me taking it and putting it in

2687
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:41,039
the in in that and then honestly just

2688
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:43,600
kind of hitting it with a hammer um just

2689
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:45,760
because like at small scale that might

2690
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:50,960
be what works for me beautiful i love

2691
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:53,920
that all right all right so um okay so

2692
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:56,158
oh micronizing so like you're describing

2693
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:59,760
this micronizing and that's really small

2694
01:40:56,158 --> 01:41:03,198
now are we as cultivators making it at

2695
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:05,600
micronized um size or are we just

2696
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:08,158
putting it in and then nature is

2697
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:10,400
breaking it down to micronized

2698
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:12,479
or both and as we bang it around it's

2699
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:14,319
it's like glass right so every time you

2700
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,319
move it it breaks down smaller and

2701
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:18,238
smaller which i advise you to wear a

2702
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:19,599
mask when handling the the char because

2703
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:20,638
you're going to breathe it in

2704
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,600
but um

2705
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:24,480
nature 2 is going to break it down small

2706
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,239
and

2707
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:28,158
these are the parts where

2708
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:30,479
as you're watering you're scratching the

2709
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:31,920
surface you're moving things around the

2710
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:33,039
char is going to work its way down into

2711
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,279
the soil

2712
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:36,158
i kind of cannabis has such a short life

2713
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,198
cycle

2714
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:41,599
i have i prefer to break it pieces of

2715
01:41:39,198 --> 01:41:42,559
that down if i'm watering in my compost

2716
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,360
teas

2717
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,760
um

2718
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:47,679
i definitely love to add the chard with

2719
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:50,239
almost all of my drops

2720
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:52,239
simply because it's that insurance

2721
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:55,118
when we're out there in the cultivation

2722
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:56,399
doing cultivation you always are at that

2723
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:58,238
point where you

2724
01:41:56,399 --> 01:41:59,359
want to give the plants all that you can

2725
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:01,279
and

2726
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:03,759
i think every farmer can relate to this

2727
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:06,319
it's and i call it the hire me or fire

2728
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,679
me drops where you know you know the

2729
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:09,359
plants are telling you give me this give

2730
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,279
me that and you're thinking in my head

2731
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:12,158
like oh my gosh we're really pushing you

2732
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:14,238
girls

2733
01:42:12,158 --> 01:42:15,519
should i do this but then when you make

2734
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:16,399
the drop

2735
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,159
and

2736
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:19,920
it works out and you know you have the

2737
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:21,839
insurance from the char

2738
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:24,079
these are the parts where they're gonna

2739
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:26,159
hire you but i've seen people do the

2740
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:28,479
same drops without the char

2741
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:29,920
and trash plants

2742
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:31,118
they didn't have the buffer you get

2743
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,840
fired

2744
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:34,079
so

2745
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,119
this allows the insurance for

2746
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:37,118
the um

2747
01:42:35,118 --> 01:42:39,118
the cultivator yeah to cover you cover

2748
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:42,238
up your screw-ups and make it yeah

2749
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:44,719
100 yeah the end result is the plants

2750
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:47,599
just they use all that electricity and

2751
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:50,000
it just turns into yoga plant yoga plant

2752
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:52,239
yoga fabulous so so why don't you why

2753
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,880
don't you kind of like um bring us home

2754
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:56,399
here quite a mug with um you know

2755
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,279
here at the end of the show

2756
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:59,679
um

2757
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:02,479
i have heard you speak before and you

2758
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:04,480
have spoken a lot about the interaction

2759
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:05,519
you know the electricity the interaction

2760
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,238
between

2761
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:11,679
the biochar and the microbes and you

2762
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:13,759
know you are a very um like systemic

2763
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:16,719
thinker right you're you're constantly

2764
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:18,480
thinking about the relationships between

2765
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:22,319
all the different

2766
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:25,039
um players um who are in the rhizosphere

2767
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:27,920
and i think that as natural growers the

2768
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:29,359
more and more we're thinking about soil

2769
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:31,440
as a

2770
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:32,880
you know as a community that we are

2771
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:35,279
supporting

2772
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:38,319
and less of

2773
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:40,000
less as the soil being like this npk

2774
01:43:38,319 --> 01:43:43,679
eating robot

2775
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:46,639
um i think that we become more allies

2776
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:47,679
with the soil instead of

2777
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:51,920
you know

2778
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:55,039
domination of the soil and um you know

2779
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:56,480
we are adding something that sounds like

2780
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:57,359
it is

2781
01:43:56,479 --> 01:43:59,759
um

2782
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:02,158
you know a very potent

2783
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,960
um

2784
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:06,638
cause of growth and i would expect that

2785
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:08,639
if we take

2786
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:10,880
you know the simple communities if we

2787
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:14,159
haven't been using biochar and we start

2788
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:16,079
using it i can imagine that there will

2789
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:21,279
be

2790
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:23,519
a new environment in our soil for

2791
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:25,679
all of the microbes and for our plant

2792
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,360
and then eventually us to smoke like

2793
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:29,199
everybody wins will you kind of like

2794
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:33,759
speak to this idea

2795
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:36,759
of of of what it means to add this

2796
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,760
electrically

2797
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:42,719
gifted biochar to

2798
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:45,359
our soils and and and

2799
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:46,319
what might be experienced by the soil

2800
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:49,679
okay

2801
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:50,479
so i'm very fascinated with conservation

2802
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:51,840
work

2803
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:53,599
and

2804
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,880
ecology

2805
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,239
and what i find out is places around the

2806
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,079
world

2807
01:44:58,238 --> 01:45:03,439
where there's the most

2808
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:05,840
macro life the most diversity plant life

2809
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:08,238
where there's most diversity living

2810
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:12,319
and they look at the soil

2811
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:16,238
it's always has a high carbon content

2812
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:19,599
and it's loaded with char

2813
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:22,879
so this tells me that

2814
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:25,920
when it happens micro at the micro level

2815
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:27,920
and you can see it at the macro

2816
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,399
something must be going on

2817
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,440
it becomes like nature's playground of

2818
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:35,039
life there's just so many

2819
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:36,960
relationships happening

2820
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:40,000
i have to ask myself what role did

2821
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:42,399
carbon play in that

2822
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,880
and then when i think further back is to

2823
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:46,319
even how our whole planet started

2824
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,760
you can see where that carbon

2825
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:51,198
relationship

2826
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,199
is hand-in-hand with water

2827
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:55,519
so we're only here for a short time on

2828
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:57,039
this planet you know

2829
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,400
and it seems

2830
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:00,719
if there's something we can do to

2831
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:03,679
co-create life

2832
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:05,520
and foster life

2833
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:07,199
and leave our permanent mark through

2834
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:09,199
carbon

2835
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:11,039
that's the real investment

2836
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:12,799
money comes and goes

2837
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:14,639
but to say that this investment we're

2838
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,840
making today is going to be here in a

2839
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:18,880
thousand years

2840
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,800
how many things can you say that for

2841
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,400
and when you take on and have the

2842
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,239
realization like

2843
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:25,759
dude i'm making a difference for a

2844
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:27,599
thousand years

2845
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:29,280
you stand different

2846
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,199
you walk different

2847
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:33,439
you feel like you got a purpose

2848
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:35,198
and it makes it an even playing field

2849
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:37,519
because all of this

2850
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:40,879
i picked up which is barely a ged

2851
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:43,040
education i sucked at school

2852
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,400
straight gangster from the streets

2853
01:46:43,039 --> 01:46:45,519
but when i learned to work with the

2854
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:48,479
plant

2855
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,480
and the plant taught me about soil

2856
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:52,638
look how i end up on shows on your show

2857
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:55,279
talking about things the homies would

2858
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:57,440
never believe i picked up on

2859
01:46:55,279 --> 01:46:58,960
so not only does it create life on the

2860
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:00,799
planet but it seems like it creates life

2861
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,920
within yourself

2862
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:06,560
and something about being on this rock

2863
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,719
especially in these times right and you

2864
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:12,080
feel like man i can do some good

2865
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:14,000
especially when we've done so much wrong

2866
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:16,079
i'm grabbing it with both hands

2867
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,319
oh yeah so i feel like that life force

2868
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:19,439
that's even within me

2869
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:23,118
it must

2870
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:25,039
transfer over into life around me

2871
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:26,719
and these are the kind of things where

2872
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:28,719
people feel like we

2873
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:30,158
can do something we can't wait around

2874
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:31,520
for someone to come in

2875
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:34,399
and do this work

2876
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:36,320
it's like this is what we're born to do

2877
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:38,719
all of us in some way is born to

2878
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:41,359
co-create whether we're creating soil

2879
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:43,840
over creating art you gotta believe it

2880
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:45,359
influences each other and this is gonna

2881
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,440
be the key

2882
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:49,118
it's not a financial thing

2883
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:51,678
it's not a money thing

2884
01:47:49,118 --> 01:47:53,920
you can't eat none of that

2885
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:56,800
but the soil and the next

2886
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,800
thousand years i can affect positively

2887
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,560
and even spreading the word if just one

2888
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,840
person starts to make char who's

2889
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:05,039
listening to this

2890
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:06,960
and starts to program nature and finally

2891
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:08,960
starts to realize wow

2892
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,639
i could really do something

2893
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:12,639
watch what happens to that community

2894
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,079
because if it transforms a little area

2895
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:15,840
into

2896
01:48:14,079 --> 01:48:18,319
so much life

2897
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:20,000
what does it do to an area where things

2898
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:21,840
aren't going so well

2899
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,800
when you add the carbon and the microbes

2900
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:26,480
to an area watch it change pick a spot

2901
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,560
don't tell nobody

2902
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:30,718
pick a spot a neighborhood and start

2903
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:33,360
adding this to a spot

2904
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:37,039
come and visit that spot add regularly

2905
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:40,000
watch what happens to that spot

2906
01:48:37,039 --> 01:48:41,760
birds show up butterflies show up

2907
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,679
hell people with a picnic basket might

2908
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,600
even end up there who you never saw a

2909
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:46,880
picnic there before

2910
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:48,320
because something happens when you

2911
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:51,600
change the soil

2912
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:52,719
that somehow changes the macro and we're

2913
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,560
part of that

2914
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,560
macro thing

2915
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:57,679
so i hope that this was

2916
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,080
able to

2917
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:02,079
make you feel like you or have already

2918
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:03,760
been doing something so much of your

2919
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:05,760
natural farmers man it's like you don't

2920
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,400
realize what role we're playing here

2921
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:10,239
but i hope this continues to inspire

2922
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,399
not just to create but to share with

2923
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:15,519
each other how we're doing these things

2924
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:17,439
to share with the younger generation

2925
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:19,760
because that's the ones who need it the

2926
01:49:17,439 --> 01:49:19,759
most

2927
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,439
wow well i definitely feel inspired i

2928
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:27,199
feel all juiced up so um

2929
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:29,039
i don't think we'll we might as well

2930
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:31,279
leave it there that's beautiful

2931
