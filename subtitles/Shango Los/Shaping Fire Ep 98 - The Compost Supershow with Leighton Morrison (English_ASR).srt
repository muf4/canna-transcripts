2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,099
compost is one of those words in natural

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,500
farming that means a lot of different

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,120
things to different people and yet we

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,579
have conversations about compost

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,259
assuming we all mean the same thing

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,019
I certainly didn't grow up around

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,060
compost or compost tea and I only really

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,980
started considering it when I started

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,179
focusing on natural farming techniques

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,099
as an adult

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,618
and then of course I read teeming with

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,820
microbes by Jeff lonefels and got really

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:34,738
interested

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,659
if you've been listening to shaping fire

16
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,820
for a while you've probably been sitting

17
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,558
right here with me as I had some of my

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,320
biggest breakthroughs in understanding

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,878
what compost is and why it is the

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,020
essential building block for natural

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,599
farming

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,359
today is one of those shows and I bet we

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,620
learn a lot about compost together if

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,539
you want to learn about cannabis Health

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,519
cultivation and technique efficiently

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,320

I'm your host Shango Los

46
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,299
my returning guest today is soil

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,819
biologist Leighton Morrison

48
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,460
Laden is a lifelong Enthusiast of both

49
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,279
aquaponics and living soil his obsession

50
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:46,139
with Biosphere 2 led him to set up an

51
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,420
aquaculture at the rodeo Institute

52
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,118
Leighton worked with world-renowned

53
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,519
biologist Dr Elaine Ingham blending his

54
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,618
aquaculture byproducts with compost and

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,719
worm castings to prove that natural

56
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,459
inputs could replace synthetics in

57
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,978
commercial cultivation

58
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,078
Layton consults widely for agriculture

59
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,399
soil regeneration and Commercial Land

60
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,438
Management projects throughout the

61
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,479
United States including recently working

62
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,939
on the Wallace Annenberg Wildlife

63
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,800
crossing over Highway 101 in California

64
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,598
that will be the largest Wildlife

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,819
Crossing in the world

66
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,919
Leighton is currently founder of Kingdom

67
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,259
aquaponics and invented their line of

68
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,659
living compost and compost tea living

69
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,759
soil products Layton's a sought after

70
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,680
speaker and co-host of a weekly podcast

71
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,818
on the future cannabis project YouTube

72
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,099
channel

73
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:35,399
Leighton has been on shaping fire a few

74
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:37,439
times before episode 54 about geology

75
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,539
and biomimicry in living soil

76
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,759
cultivation this was the episode that

77
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:45,539
brought leighton's popular soil horizons

78
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,659
concept into Mass adoption episode 59 on

79
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,359
water and watering episode 82 about

80
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,098
properly using aerobic and anaerobic

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
soil amendments to meet the needs of

82
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,439
your soil at different stages in episode

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,659
87 where we do a debrief on the first

84
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,459
cycle of the shaping fire indoor growing

85
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,439
tent where we test regenerative

86
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,900
techniques indoors including his

87
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:10,079
Horizons model for living soil

88
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,599
so you might ask Shango why bring back a

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,760
guest for a fifth time and that's a fair

90
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,518
question and I have two answers

91
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,919
first have you heard any of the Leighton

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,800
Morrison episodes they're incredible the

93
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,679
depth in them is hard to ignore Leighton

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
has the scientific background plus is an

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,580
Ardent natural farmer and he actually

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,159
grows stuff and doesn't like live in a

97
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,739
lab he is kind of like Indiana Jones in

98
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,840
a way he has the academics down solid

99
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,480
but he spends most of his time in the

100
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,580
field applying these skills and Orchards

101
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,919
and soil regeneration projects research

102
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,659
and development cannabis cultivation and

103
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,639
he's even a consultant for the Dallas

104
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,199
Cowboys keeping their grass practice

105
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,359
field thriving

106
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,219
second I looked for someone else to be

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
on this show I got referrals from

108
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,780
friends and peers everyone I looked into

109
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,780
was an expert at making thermal compost

110
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,818
scoping compost and teaching it for this

111
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,818
episode though I needed a scientist who

112
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:08,818
could look Beyond this one category of

113
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:11,339
thermal compost to the larger picture of

114
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,079
soil microbinoculation which is what I'm

115
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,640
most interested in and I think is what

116
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,759
people actually want when they make

117
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,439
compost tea with thermal compost so in

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,418
the end I called up late and I asked him

119
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,000
to join me for this episode and that I

120
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,198
wanted to go big and cover a lot in one

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,899
episode

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,819
during today's episode the first set is

123
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,039
a review of different varieties of

124
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,259
compost their benefits and challenges

125
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,840
with a special consideration for the

126
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,639
home grower during the second set we

127
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,638
talk about creating the highest amount

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,340
of microbe activity in compost cold

129
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,860
compost and how to use it without fear

130
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,839
of pathogens and we wrap up with the

131
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,879
third set discussing compost grain

132
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:54,179
structure how to make premium cold

133
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,399
compost cold compost extract and even

134
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,780
make compost shelf stable for use

135
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,478
throughout the year

136
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,459
welcome back to shaping fire Leighton

137
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,959
oh thank you Shango I look forward to it

138
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,638
as always yeah man it's always great to

139
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,739
have you here so let's get right into it

140
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,319
you know I've been thinking about doing

141
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,300
this show about the varieties of compost

142
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,579
for some time

143
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,379
um but I really didn't decide to pull

144
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,258
the trigger on it until you and I had

145
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:22,259
that conversation just a few days ago

146
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,879
where you started kind of like teasing

147
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,699
apart

148
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:30,600
um this compost question I had in my

149
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:34,139
head and and you know even though the

150
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,960
the goal of today is to kind of uh talk

151
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,900
about the the science of

152
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:43,079
um the science and the biology of soil

153
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:45,179
structure I want to start with the

154
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,918
rather mundane

155
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,139
um question that I approached you with

156
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,879
because even though we're eventually

157
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,478
going to go somewhere heavier and more

158
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:58,500
biological I can't be the only one who

159
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:01,319
is a cultivator who who looks at these

160
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:06,060
different varieties of compost that we

161
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,978
have available to us and and trying to

162
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,319
figure out which ones are most viable

163
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,839
and which ones are like you know garbage

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,180
and I shouldn't even consider so

165
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,959
um so so let's let's go through the list

166
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,259
of the the six varieties of compost that

167
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,719
I have come in contact in my world and

168
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,620
let's just talk about each of them

169
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,259
individually so that when when

170
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,300
cultivators who come in contact with

171
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,300
these other types of compost know how to

172
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,319
judge them okay so so let's start with

173
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,720
the most common kind of compost which is

174
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,039
the bagged stuff that they sell at the

175
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,020
store and and I'm not even really

176
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,360
talking about necessarily like really

177
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,279
good quality bagged compost which I'm

178
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,660
assuming there is such a thing I'm

179
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,198
talking about the kind of stuff that

180
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:58,439
they sell for six bucks in front of the

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,900
grocery store in the spring and um you

182
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,259
know that stuff come different kinds of

183
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:07,079
company bag those up where I live

184
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:10,139
there's a company that actually collects

185
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,818
um uh yard refuse yard and garden and

186
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,038
food refuse

187
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,419
um from in front of people's houses and

188
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,199
then they take that to their big

189
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:21,779
facility and they are quote make compost

190
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,300
and and then when it's done they put it

191
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:27,000
in a bag and they sell it back to us for

192
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,240
six bucks all right and so

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,978
um you know it says compost and and so

194
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,960
many people are buying it for their

195
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:36,779
Gardens and to make their raised beds

196
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,299
and lots of people putting it in pots

197
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,579
but you know I buy you know when I used

198
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,579
to buy these I you know you buy it and

199
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:47,279
you rip it open and um and I would smell

200
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,379
ammonia and it would use it would often

201
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,719
have white on it and I'm all like I

202
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:54,839
don't I don't think that's mycelium that

203
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,340
looks like some kind of white rot or

204
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,318
something

205
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,619
um and then when you know as I've gotten

206
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,860
more mature in the living soil scene and

207
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,860
I've seen the kinds of composts that um

208
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,979
living soil

209
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,780
Artisans make I remember like how how

210
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:16,199
dare they sell this bagged stuff is

211
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:18,179
compost is it even compost so so let's

212
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,038
talk about that first

213
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,780
um it kind of explained to me I mean I

214
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:23,098
know each company makes it different but

215
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,198
I think that by probably by the time

216
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,538
it's in the bag they're probably pretty

217
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,319
similar so so teach me a little bit

218
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:34,500
about what my expectations should be for

219
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,360
that compost that's in a sealed plastic

220
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,080
bag

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,240
all right

222
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,419
um so let's start with the word compost

223
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,139
uh the word compost is a process it it's

224
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:48,720
not a product it's not a so I think that

225
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:53,039
that's where the real conversation

226
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,800
um begins is that okay there are a lot

227
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,679
of different types of compost and again

228
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,620
because I don't have a better word

229
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:04,259
um to choose we're going to use that

230
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,839
word we'll get into what it really means

231
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,759
I'm sure in another set but for the

232
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,440
beginning let's just say this is a

233
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,399
compost

234
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,040
so when you smell ammonia

235
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,039
um that is part of the thermophilic

236
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,980
breakdown of organic matter you said

237
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,319
well you called it junk well nature

238
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,420
doesn't make junk

239
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,040
nature just breaks down

240
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:33,000
um organic matter

241
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:35,039
um into carbon and nitrogen all living

242
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,559
things are made of carbon and nitrogen

243
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,799
along with you know other elements

244
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,159
uh from the periodic tables so

245
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,979
just for the sake of keeping it simple

246
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:48,958
when you smell the ammonia you are in

247
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,759
still in what we call a thermophilic

248
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,159
phase you haven't you haven't shifted

249
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,899
into the mesophilic

250
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,120
um so that means that active

251
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,039
decomposition is happening and that

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,539
ammonia smell is the release the

253
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,958
byproduct

254
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:06,059
of the thermal fights

255
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,458
um knocking the carbon and the nitrogen

256
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,079
off um they can't they can't eat too

257
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,778
much nitrogen they really are there for

258
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,778
the carbon and so that nitrogen is being

259
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,679
released in an ammoniacal gas ammonia

260
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:20,278
gas

261
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:22,079
so that product is is unstable if you

262
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:23,939
apply that to

263
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,459
um like healthy young plants you're

264
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,920
going to kill them because basically the

265
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:32,000
thermophytes are going to stealing

266
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,559
carbon and releasing the nitrogen

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,240
and therefore starve the plant out

268
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,919
because the plant actually wants the

269
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,339
nitrogen or or I should say the

270
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,778
mesophilic bacteria want that nitrogen

271
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,180
to break it down and release it to the

272
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,620
plant so that they get more exudates so

273
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,899
you're in a

274
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,820
you're in kind of a bind and and the

275
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,639
other thing the white you saw

276
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,459
well that's actually octino bacteria a

277
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,139
lot of people confuse uh that white for

278
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,879
mycelium but it isn't it's just

279
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,100
basically

280
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,078
um the actina bacteria

281
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,399
um and it's indicating heat it's that

282
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,639
there's still quite a bit of Heat

283
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:12,419
present in in that compost

284
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:15,720
so that being said

285
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:17,399
um you're dealing with a product that is

286
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,560
unstable

287
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,139
it wouldn't even be considered you know

288
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,179
poem which we'll get into later but

289
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:27,179
let's let's keep me on track here right

290
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:28,979
on um so the the the the stuff that's in

291
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:32,879
these bags it sounds like it'd be fair

292
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:37,079
to just call it immature like it is if

293
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:39,179
if our goal was it was a thermal compost

294
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,799
um I think what I think you're

295
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,078
suggesting to me that like like it

296
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:45,419
wasn't finished correct it was unstable

297
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,458
I see I think unfinished is a great way

298
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:50,819
to put it all right so so

299
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:52,979
um as as we know from anything uh that's

300
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,680
made at a scaled level like like even

301
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,320
cannabis flowers if you're scaling

302
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,019
things up so often the product that

303
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,360
comes out is

304
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,860
um you know not premium and so these

305
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,259
companies these companies are making

306
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,700
like just like thousands and thousands

307
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,220
of these bags and they're kind of

308
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,040
rushing them through and so the fact

309
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,320
that we are seeing that bacteria and

310
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,480
we're smelling the ammonia and it's

311
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,000
still breaking down

312
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,339
um uh it's essentially just saying that

313
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,958
they rushed the process

314
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,820
absolutely and the other thing you have

315
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,278
to keep in mind too is that at these

316
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,019
compost yards they don't have the

317
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:31,919
ability to separate the greens and the

318
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,078
Browns

319
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,500
so that's probably one of the most

320
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,379
critical uh pieces of making

321
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,240
um especially biological compost is that

322
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,039
you have the correct ratio of greens to

323
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,740
Browns if you have too much greens you

324
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,059
have too much nitrogen it's going to go

325
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,639
hyperthermophilic and there's nothing

326
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:53,278
you can do to stop well there is and

327
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,339
we'll get into that I'm sure later but

328
00:12:53,278 --> 00:13:00,059
there's nothing you can do to prevent

329
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:03,380
that thermophilic phase from continuing

330
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:07,679
until it there's no nitrogen left

331
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:10,919
to be broken off to steal the carbon

332
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:15,000
so that being said if you can manage

333
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:17,278
your greens and Browns you can put a

334
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,139
predetermined point in time and say well

335
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,179
you know after six months this is going

336
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,579
to have be gone through the thermophilic

337
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:26,939
and into the mesophilic mesophilic means

338
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:29,338
stable safe to apply will not will not

339
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,459
steal nitrogen from my plant

340
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,399
and will be a suitable source of of soil

341
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:38,239
organic carbon that will provide all

342
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,839
kinds of benefits to soil

343
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,299
so

344
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,160
um so is there a use case for this right

345
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:46,139
you mean you said don't put don't use

346
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,819
this stuff on young plants

347
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,339
um because it'll it'll steal from them

348
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,220
well I would naturally take that and say

349
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:56,040
well then I I sure as hell don't want to

350
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,500
put this in my beds and put my clones or

351
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,879
my my seed starts into it and then I'm

352
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,578
all like well I probably don't want to

353
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:06,059
use this in my pots either like is there

354
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:08,939
is there any use for these things that's

355
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:12,078
that's a great question so

356
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:16,200
um yeah it's a herbicide

357
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:18,239
it will kill plants yeah yeah so in my

358
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,620
workout here in Cali

359
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,419
I'm working with a lot of different

360
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,399
farmers and a lot of different

361
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,699
um you know Growers of different things

362
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,440
when I found out that um

363
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,180
this company compost company that I've

364
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,040
been working with

365
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:35,039
um was using it as a herbicide I was

366
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,539
horrified it was like oh my God what are

367
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,159
we doing and then I stopped and went

368
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,799
wait a minute

369
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,259
I don't care if it's herbicide it's

370
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,319
still carbon it's still getting put into

371
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:47,120
the soil it's still providing a longer

372
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,820
term

373
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,860
source of fertility and CEC cation

374
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,660
exchange capacity which is a valuable

375
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,539
resource for uh providing long-term

376
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:02,458
fertility to plants whether they're you

377
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:04,500
know strawberries or trees it doesn't

378
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:07,979
matter so the fact that they're actually

379
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:11,278
taking this stuff and turning it in is

380
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,120
actually a benefit because when you stop

381
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:16,679
the thermophilic phase by taking this

382
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,899
immature compost and you till it into

383
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:22,198
the soil you've you've basically

384
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:25,860
prevented those thermal fights from

385
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:27,919
um producing that excess gas so

386
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:32,039
therefore you've actually put some

387
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:35,639
ammonical or nitrate based fertilizer

388
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,740
into play because it's no longer gassing

389
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,740
off so it's it actually has a couple

390
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:44,519
different benefits so that being said

391
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,579
what do you do with this compost

392
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,940
um I I would use it as a top dressing

393
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:53,399
for for a mature lawn or a top dressing

394
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,260
for a mature tree I wouldn't I wouldn't

395
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,360
go heavy with it but I would definitely

396
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,600
like sprinkle on up you know half an

397
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,278
inch and then just kind of massage it in

398
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,680
because you're going to get some benefit

399
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,659
from it in in that regard but no way

400
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:08,698
would I put seed starts or clones or

401
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,740
anything else into it because you're not

402
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:13,259
going to get a good result

403
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,839
so it sounds to me that unless we're

404
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:20,399
talking about uh putting a whole bunch

405
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,139
of it on on a on a field or or a or

406
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,299
distributed you know cultivation area

407
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,519
there really isn't much application for

408
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,599
this in cannabis growing which is kind

409
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,778
of our point

410
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,480
correct all right so unless unless you

411
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:35,820
take it open it and and pile it up and

412
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,139
let it go through the phase let it so if

413
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,600
you bring it home and finish yourself

414
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,860
incorrect correct

415
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,180
um well we might as well hit that how

416
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,100
would somebody let's let's say that

417
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,500
somebody only has access to this kind of

418
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,940
stuff how would you easily finish it at

419
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,940
home assuming you don't have a farm

420
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,480
um so you take it back to your place and

421
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,600
then blend it with

422
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,620
um other sources of carbon so wood chips

423
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,078
uh straw or not straw yeah straw because

424
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,380
straw is more of a brown than it is a

425
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:10,318
green it's not hey hey is a green

426
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,120
um and leaf litter anything any source

427
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,338
of brown maybe maybe your last year's

428
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,859
soil too yeah yeah it'd be a great way

429
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,838
to to use up some excess soil

430
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,759
um so you just blend it together and

431
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,438
then pile it up and and stick your hand

432
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,838
in there and if it's if it's heating up

433
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,480
add more Browns until until you get to a

434
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,178
point where it's no longer heating up to

435
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,960
a point where it's uh uncomfortable for

436
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:35,220
your arm I mean it if it's if it's at 85

437
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,100
degrees

438
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,620
which in many ways is the sweet spot for

439
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:42,538
biological Generation

440
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,759
Um it's going to feel kind of cool to

441
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:48,179
you because you're you run at 90 what

442
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:49,919
eight degrees so so it wouldn't be

443
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,140
uncomfortable now if you stick your hand

444
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:57,600
in there and it's hot that means it's

445
00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:00,538
above 100 degrees uh 110 120. it begins

446
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,399
to get very uncomfortable if if it's 130

447
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:05,220
it's going to start to burn your arm so

448
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,759
that's a good way to gauge in the field

449
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,819
without a compost thermometer

450
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:15,298
how you're maturing your compost

451
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:17,939
all right cool so let's go to

452
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,619
um uh the next uh I'm I'm making up

453
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,960
these kind of [ __ ] categories myself

454
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:23,579
so uh let's go to the second [ __ ]

455
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,038
category which is

456
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:28,079
um uh home food waste compost now I want

457
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,538
to be clear we're gonna the next the

458
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,980
next variety we're gonna talk about is

459
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:34,679
like like

460
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,538
food waste compost made by an organic

461
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,100
Gardener who's like read a book and

462
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:40,079
watched some videos and they know what

463
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,939
they're doing right so what what I'm

464
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,500
talking about more specifically are

465
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,880
people who've got their heart in the

466
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,038
right place but they don't really know

467
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,140
what they're doing all right so so

468
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,640
they're people who they are producing uh

469
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,100
home food waste maybe they're getting

470
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,240
some some stuff for their neighbors

471
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,279
um they don't have anybody with

472
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,200
neighborhood pigs to give them to so

473
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,019
they're putting it in a pile and

474
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,640
whenever they remember it

475
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,740
um you know it'll get turned a couple

476
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,538
times a year or whatever and then

477
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,700
eventually it you know it does break

478
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:11,099
down it stops to smell it's probably got

479
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,880
some like big chunks of stuff in it

480
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:17,879
right and um but uh so it's it's kind of

481
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,280
lackadaisical compost but but I come I

482
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,960
come I run into that all the time I will

483
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:27,538
often post to the Vashon Island you know

484
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,058
a farm or or food cultivators list and

485
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:31,200
say like hey anybody got excess compost

486
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:32,700
that you're looking to get rid of

487
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,700
because I don't really have a lot of

488
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,319
space for that and um and and you know

489
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,538
sometimes I'll get good stuff but most

490
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,939
the time it's this this stuff I'm

491
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,319
talking about where where people are are

492
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,259
making this like kind of like

493
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,298
lackadaisical pile and they're like yeah

494
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,298
come come take this stuff so that I can

495
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,460
feel good that I've like moved it back

496
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:54,900
into

497
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,160
the biosphere

498
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,038
um but I don't know what to do with it

499
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,019
right so so so

500
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,759
what are your thoughts on on this kind

501
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:06,480
of stuff I'm I'm guessing you're going

502
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:09,779
to start with it is also immature

503
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,880
um yeah and potentially pathogenic

504
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,399
um yeah so that's why when you're

505
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,400
dealing with food waste you really

506
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,340
only have three ways to responsibly deal

507
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,440
with it if you just take it and pile it

508
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:26,639
up in the backyard it's gonna stink it's

509
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,620
going to attract pests uh ants uh

510
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,400
unwanted Critters

511
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:35,939
um you know raccoons you name it so not

512
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,280
really a smart thing to do a lot of

513
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,759
people that have food waste will often

514
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:44,639
add it to a static compost pile which is

515
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,798
yard waste sleeves and chips and

516
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,679
everything else that you've collected in

517
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,480
the spring after the winter and piled up

518
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,919
and and that's a little bit more safe

519
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,599
way to deal with it because you're not

520
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,000
going to attract to those paths

521
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,798
necessarily at the same level you would

522
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,440
if you just piled it up and let it rot

523
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,259
in the backyard

524
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:07,919
and you'll also get some benefit to

525
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:10,379
adding in those Browns again greens and

526
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,140
browns food waste is pure nitrogen so

527
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,840
it's it's gonna go hot

528
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,559
um it's gonna stink it's gonna gas off

529
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:23,339
both methane ammonia

530
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:26,759
um as and and like putrification gas you

531
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:29,639
know gas is that not don't necessarily

532
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,259
uh you know they're not good terpenes

533
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,520
put it that way

534
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:35,220
so

535
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,200
um as far as like dealing with with you

536
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,140
know food waste

537
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,900
my recommendations is to

538
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:46,020
um get people to either feed them to

539
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:49,200
worms which is a safe way of breaking

540
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:51,179
them down and and avoiding

541
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,980
um you know pathogenic uh

542
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,620
cross-contamination which is a real

543
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,360
issue if any of you have you know gotten

544
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,879
an upset stomach due to something that

545
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,279
you ate that was not particularly

546
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,440
healthy then you would understand that

547
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,240
this is not something that you want to

548
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,679
have happen to you an upset stomach is

549
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,038
no joke

550
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,919
so um in handling that it's it's really

551
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:17,579
you know again feed it to worms first

552
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:21,120
then take the Varma compost and use that

553
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:24,240
as a supplement in your compost or as a

554
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,819
top dressing but again it can't be gooey

555
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,038
it can't smell bad

556
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:31,200
um it has to have had the opportunity to

557
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,759
break down to a point where it's no

558
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,440
longer going to be potentially

559
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:38,119
pathogenic

560
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,340
so that's really the the only

561
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:44,239
responsible way to deal with with like

562
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:46,199
food waste another thing is is you can

563
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,220
you know do something that's a little

564
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,480
bit more

565
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,298
um

566
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,339
how we say old style which is to dig a

567
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:54,839
hole and put your cup put your food

568
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,759
waste in there and put a lid over the

569
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,379
top of it and just let nature do its

570
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:00,900
thing

571
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,900
um and and that's what we would call an

572
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,880
anaerobic digestion because it's going

573
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,159
to stink like hell down there

574
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,820
um but the microbes will naturally break

575
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,620
it down and convert it back into organic

576
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,720
matter

577
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:18,178
um so there's another way for you to

578
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,798
safely deal with your food waste

579
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,780
um and you know a lot of times you've

580
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,058
got to keep in mind too like you know

581
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,339
people oh eggshells eggshells are great

582
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:28,678
well they're also got a lot of E coli on

583
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:31,079
them uh same with meats you know those

584
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,419
those meats and and dairies are are a

585
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,639
little bit more tricky to compost than

586
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,840
just fruits and veggies um and fruits

587
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,940
have their issued too because they have

588
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:42,000
a lot of sugar uh they can attract a lot

589
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,220
of pests but when you get into these all

590
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,319
right I'm gonna throw everything

591
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,058
including the kitchen sink no pun

592
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,579
intended

593
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,740
um into my compost pile you really gotta

594
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:56,158
go thermophilic you got to cook that

595
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,319
stuff hard to prevent any kind of again

596
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,140
attracting pests or or potential

597
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,740
potential pathogenic

598
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,900
um

599
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,900
you know uh cross-contamination

600
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,839
um

601
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,880
well a I never considered the pathogens

602
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,500
and I think that's really important but

603
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,020
I gotta tell you I just got to say you

604
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,538
really got my attention with this

605
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,700
um anaerobic

606
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:23,519
compost hole

607
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,440
um that sounds like a really fun project

608
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,720
um is the stuff that will come out of

609
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,220
that like rich and delicious for my

610
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,380
cannabis plants

611
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,360
after it goes through the digestion

612
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,580
process absolutely how long does that

613
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,439
process take depends on how much you

614
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:40,379
piled in there and if you continue to

615
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,380
pile on top of it I mean it's think of

616
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,860
it like uh like you ever seen a flow

617
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,200
through Verma compost uh system yeah

618
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,599
where you take from the bottom and you

619
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,460
feed the top

620
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:55,439
in the hole the bottom is going to be

621
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,240
where the value is

622
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,759
um not the top where you just added

623
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,380
stuff so basically you have to let that

624
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,538
sit for

625
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,640
because you can't Harvest from the

626
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,980
bottom unless you try to cross tunnel

627
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,559
over yeah yeah that's much probably too

628
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,798
much work certainly I'm imagining like

629
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,779
Phil Phil like digging a hole filling it

630
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:18,720
with like

631
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,339
um kitchen waste and then when it's and

632
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,319
then then just fill the hole and then

633
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:24,178
just cover it and leave it and then go

634
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:27,599
dig another hole and then like maybe

635
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,919
I've got like nine holes and I think

636
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,500
you're about to tell me about how long

637
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,960
that would take and so like okay I make

638
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,179
the holes and then after X variable

639
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,179
amount of time I know that I can go back

640
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,460
to Hole one and use that and then like

641
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,559
some weeks later I can go back to Hole

642
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,100
two and then when I pull hole one I can

643
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:49,379
go refill it so so how how long let's

644
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,240
just say like you know reasonably since

645
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,278
I don't have a backhoe I'm probably not

646
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,099
going to dig a hole that's you know much

647
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,778
bigger than three by three let's say I

648
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,639
wouldn't even go that big just use a

649
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:02,278
post hole digger

650
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,620
right so just dig a post hole you know

651
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:06,900
like me it's a really small eight inches

652
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,119
around yeah six eight inches around I

653
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,880
mean how much food waste do you generate

654
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:15,298
not a lot yeah so I guess yeah I guess

655
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,220
that's true huh and a great way to

656
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:20,038
um store it

657
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,900
is actually to freeze it so that you can

658
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,940
just freeze as you go throughout the

659
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,400
course of the week maybe it takes two

660
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,419
weeks to to store up enough for a one

661
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,940
post hole

662
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,919
and you know dig the post hole mark it

663
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,278
with a flag and then cover it over with

664
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,500
soil on top and if you go back probably

665
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,778
I don't know maybe three five months

666
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,359
three to six months you will have this

667
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:45,058
amazing black organic stuff with tons of

668
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:46,500
worm castings in it wow like and then

669
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:48,480
and then if they're not three by three

670
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,819
holes I could you know I could easily

671
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,919
make 25 of these in a row each with each

672
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:56,038
with their own plant tag giving me their

673
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:59,220
the date that I capped them off do I

674
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:01,980
need to worry about the um the E coli

675
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,960
from the eggshells when I do this style

676
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,038
no because everything is going to break

677
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,120
down

678
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,460
um you're going to have rapid

679
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,658
decomposition and an anaerobic digestion

680
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,720
system

681
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:15,720
so the the E coli is just going to get

682
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,400
consumed by other biology

683
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,679
um what if what if I'm a cultivator

684
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,440
who's in the ground

685
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,440
um and I have got like a a cultivation

686
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:28,019
field let's just say I've got three rows

687
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,320
of five plants you know and uh and so

688
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:34,980
I've got like 15 plants could I just

689
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:37,798
um make these post holes like around my

690
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,380
garden and then just like never get them

691
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:43,079
out just like put them in and and just

692
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,419
cap it and just say you know all all of

693
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:49,079
this all these nutrients will eventually

694
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:52,740
be accessed by the root Zone and they'll

695
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:54,119
be pulled from you know three four five

696
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,339
feet away from the plants and they'll

697
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,979
just be pulled over by nature and so I'm

698
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:01,980
just kind of um creating these little

699
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,919
post holes like little caches of

700
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,500
nutrition for the soil and the plants is

701
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,720
that legit absolutely and I mean you

702
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,119
could take it even further and

703
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,900
um when you harvest in the fall

704
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,579
um

705
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,320
you know go next to the root ball

706
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:18,658
obviously I don't want you to take that

707
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,700
out it's valuable nutrition but go next

708
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,380
to it and dig a hole and put it in there

709
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,900
and next to your plant right on top of

710
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,299
it it'll have six months of digestion

711
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,159
yeah all right Black Gold dude Black

712
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:31,079
Gold that's really a cool idea all right

713
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,200
now there is one other piece that I left

714
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,939
out in in dealing with food waste

715
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,220
um it's called fermentation

716
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,340
now that's been a big topic over the

717
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:45,058
last five years or so you know Jay Dom

718
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:46,379
and and natural farming methods and so

719
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,418
one of the other things you can do

720
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,000
especially if you have a situation where

721
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:53,220
you just you had a party and you have

722
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,859
all this leftover food like you know

723
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,538
hamburgers hot dogs steak chicken pork

724
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,579
whatever

725
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:02,000
um but you just you're overwhelmed if

726
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:05,480
you have a trash bucket full of food

727
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,058
what you can do is actually take that

728
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,480
and cover it with water and put a uh

729
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:15,720
like a wire mesh or wire cloth over the

730
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,220
top of it so it's held down and weighted

731
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,380
um so that the food and everything

732
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,519
underneath it is under the surface of

733
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,799
the water

734
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:27,058
now this is a way to

735
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:30,778
basically uh break it down into enzymes

736
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:35,119
very very quickly and then those enzymes

737
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:37,200
can be used in for in again in a thermal

738
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,879
thermophilic compost

739
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,798
and really make that compost explode

740
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,500
biologically because you've got all of

741
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:50,398
the secondary and tertiary metabolites

742
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,720
uh in in biological food and so of

743
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:53,759
course the biology is just going to go

744
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,319
ballistic when it comes in contact with

745
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,179
the stuff because it's just ready to eat

746
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,058
it's like you know McDonald's and Burger

747
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,519
King

748
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:06,119
so that's another component to dealing

749
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,700
with with you know food waste now do

750
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,259
would I recommend you know doing that on

751
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,460
a smaller scale probably not because

752
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:13,798
it's going to be a pain in the ass

753
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,620
whereas you know digging a post hole and

754
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:19,319
dumping you know some Frozen

755
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:22,079
um scraps for last two weeks is a very

756
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,720
easy to do method whereas this

757
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,879
fermentation process takes a little bit

758
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,120
longer and again now you've got this

759
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,480
bucket that you have to let sit for a

760
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:36,619
minimum of probably seven days until it

761
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,120
you've gotten through the the

762
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:41,099
fermentation process and you're probably

763
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,918
going to see foam on the surface of the

764
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:47,639
water and other indications that it's

765
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,340
still very highly active and so you do

766
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,840
not want to uncork this while it's in

767
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:53,178
this again

768
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,278
um

769
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:58,679
anaerobic digestion because it's going

770
00:30:56,278 --> 00:31:01,619
to stink like hell but after a period of

771
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,538
you know you know it depends again on

772
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,459
the size of the container how much

773
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:07,798
you're dealing with how much meat versus

774
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,740
how much vegetables as to how long it'll

775
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,960
take to break down but after a period of

776
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,819
time it won't even stink anymore it'll

777
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,200
be slimy you know you'll probably get

778
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:17,819
like a mother

779
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,679
um you know like a kombucha mother on

780
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:22,678
the top of it

781
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,840
um but it won't smell anymore and that's

782
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,480
when you know okay this this stuff is

783
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:29,278
rocket fuel for biology now I take this

784
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,399
and add it to my compost pile it will

785
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,380
not stink and all of those mobile

786
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,178
nutrients

787
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,700
um that could wash through the soil very

788
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:41,159
quickly if it rained will be consumed

789
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,500
very quickly by the biology

790
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:45,919
wow right on and and when it's in the

791
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:50,179
stank stage do not get that stuff on you

792
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:53,220
your evil smell for days

793
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:54,538
exactly all right so our our next

794
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,140
category

795
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:59,519
um is is going to be uh what for lack of

796
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,460
a better term I'll call it curated

797
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,460
compost so this is the kind of compost

798
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,860
that is made by you know organic

799
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,860
gardeners your friend who who knows

800
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,240
better took a class and you know read a

801
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:14,519
couple books

802
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,859
um they know what they're doing and so

803
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,038
they're they're they're creating their

804
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:21,479
pile and you know maybe they're even

805
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,460
um you know making sure that certain

806
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,140
types of food stuffs are in there so

807
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,019
that the compost that comes out of it

808
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,899
has a particular nutrition ratio that

809
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:33,240
they're looking for and uh and and it's

810
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:36,719
getting turned on time and they've got a

811
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,460
compost you know thermometer and so you

812
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,200
know we're talking kind of like creme de

813
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:45,600
the creme of of heated compost piles and

814
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,860
and you're very lucky they like you they

815
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,079
like the weed that you're growing and

816
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:51,119
they say hey I've got I've got extra of

817
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,158
this stuff you know you break when you

818
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,719
want to bring over your pickup and you

819
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,640
know get what you want and then you're

820
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,339
like hell yeah and you go over so so

821
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
tell me about this compost compared to

822
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:01,740
the other stuff we were talking about so

823
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,740
far

824
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,399
all right so I'd have to believe

825
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,179
um

826
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:11,398
that this this compost curator has has

827
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:13,038
gone through the thermophilic phase and

828
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:15,359
into the mesophilic in other words

829
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,980
didn't rush it

830
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,538
um use the proper green to Brown

831
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,640
relationship

832
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,980
um whether they used food waste or

833
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,100
manure we we call those High nitrogen

834
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,919
sources as long as they're using High

835
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:30,898
nitrogen sources responsibly so less

836
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,159
than 10 percent

837
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:33,898
um and they are going through the

838
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,320
process of turning it like you said

839
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:40,798
until that gets to the point where it no

840
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,359
longer continues to go thermophilic now

841
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,940
you've pushed it into the mesophilic

842
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:48,418
phase now you have a what I want to call

843
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,580
nutrient dense compost

844
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:53,038
um so there's a high value of nutrition

845
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:56,099
there but I'm not saying that there's

846
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:58,319
biology there and this is this is

847
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:00,298
something that I've learned over the

848
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,678
years I've you know been across the

849
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,558
country I don't know how many times

850
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,298
worked with clients all over I've worked

851
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,338
with people that's oh my God I make the

852
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:10,320
best compost you know old hippies that

853
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:13,079
you know they've been around for a long

854
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,539
time uh worked with Dairy Farmers horse

855
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,779
Farmers you name it

856
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:20,398
generally speaking the one piece that

857
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,379
they're all missing

858
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,299
is the biology

859
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:27,118
biology takes

860
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,580
perhaps a year or two to come back into

861
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,639
that pile after it's gone thermophilic

862
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:35,519
to a point where it would get into the

863
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,179
realm just getting close to the realm of

864
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:43,019
what I would call a biological inoculant

865
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:46,019
so that guy on the farm who's you know

866
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:48,418
through his you know his yard scraps and

867
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:50,338
his his vegetable scraps probably not as

868
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:53,579
meat because he doesn't want to attract

869
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:56,279
the pests into his pile and and you know

870
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,139
turn it or left it static I mean that's

871
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,240
another way to deal with it

872
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,879
um static just takes longer for it to

873
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,358
break down but you're getting you're

874
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,460
going to get a better biological compost

875
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:11,039
from static versus turning because every

876
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:15,420
time you turn that pile every time you

877
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:18,300
expose those microbes to UV to oxidation

878
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,760
through exposure to air

879
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,900
um you're you're knocking them way back

880
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:29,640
you're you're basically

881
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:31,920
pushing them into a cyst form or into a

882
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:34,019
um you know a form where they're being

883
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,659
consumed by other biology so you've

884
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:38,699
turned them into a biostimulant which is

885
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:41,759
basically what happens to thermophytes

886
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:44,159
in a Mesa little phase they're being

887
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,240
consumed by other bacteria and protozoa

888
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:52,019
and and converted into a what we call a

889
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:55,199
biotic bank account like it's there and

890
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:58,019
it will be available when uh the time is

891
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:00,960
appropriate for for the next level of

892
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:03,838
bacteria to be consumed and released in

893
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,338
plant available form so you're you're

894
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,980
basically like

895
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:09,960
banking a biostimulant in a situation

896
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,639
like that but you're not you're not

897
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,940
producing

898
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:19,739
um biological compost per se

899
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:21,780
if I was clear on that so so

900
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:24,659
um this this this compost that we're

901
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,579
talking about that is finished and it is

902
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:29,578
stable

903
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,859
um how are we going to

904
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,359
um you know we can use that in in all

905
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:35,880
the ways that we normally think about

906
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,920
compost at this point right is a correct

907
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,559
as a top dress is a soil amendment all

908
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,240
that kind of stuff exactly so unlike the

909
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,219
other ones that we've talked about so

910
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:47,759
far that have got limitations because

911
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:50,399
they've never become stable this is the

912
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,440
first one in the list where we can feel

913
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,079
pretty safe doing whatever we want with

914
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,720
it yep and again test it you know stick

915
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,820
your hand in it pile it up and and feel

916
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:01,858
if it starts to heat up again if it if

917
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,200
it heats up

918
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:05,880
um then you're still in what we would

919
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,039
consider decomposition phase

920
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,539
thermophilic phase but if it doesn't

921
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,639
heat up or if you stick your hand in

922
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:15,900
there and it feels a little cool to you

923
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:19,739
then you you know you've got a uh stable

924
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,480
um organic matter all right cool man we

925
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,759
have to introduce that at some point in

926
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,619
the near future so instead of calling it

927
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,359
compost we need to call it

928
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,280
um like those terms that I've talked to

929
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,519
you about like ground up organic matter

930
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,560
gum uh Palm particular organic matter or

931
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:36,239
MOA mineral Associated organic matter

932
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,578
because now you're getting into that

933
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,459
point where

934
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:44,099
it's it's it's in a phase of

935
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,820
decomposition so everything

936
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:50,579
starts with with

937
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:53,460
soil and plant growing and then breaks

938
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:55,260
back down into soil eventually yeah we

939
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,480
need especially since you pointed out

940
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,640
the beginning that compost is really a

941
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,179
process and not a product we really need

942
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,440
new vocabulary words for these various

943
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,838
products that we're talking about

944
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,880
because people say oh my compost your

945
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:10,858
compost and really people are comparing

946
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,740
very different things because they're

947
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:15,358
they're not all at the same

948
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:18,659
um maturity status

949
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:21,000
attitude we did a compost cup out here a

950
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:23,639
year ago the Ventura County Compost cup

951
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,059
we brought in all of the local compost

952
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:30,299
producers everything from you know the

953
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:32,699
family Gardener to uh you know these big

954
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,740
companies that make it and you know

955
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:37,439
these you know experts these These are

956
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:41,759
Heavy Hitters that came we had 10 judges

957
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,139
uh one was a uh soil scientist from

958
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,720
rodale

959
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,940
others were business owners

960
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,319
could produce large-scale amount volumes

961
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:53,159
of compost

962
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:56,280
all the way down to guys that make what

963
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:59,279
I would consider uh Moen mineral or

964
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,440
Associated organic matter

965
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,140
um and and we put them all out on a

966
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,599
table and I spent three days prior to

967
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:09,239
this microscoping every sample to see

968
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,220
which ones were would would I consider

969
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:11,819
biologically

970
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:14,039
um

971
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,059
inoculant

972
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:19,739
and so we had these 10 judges I was not

973
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:21,679
one of them because I was biased because

974
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:24,779
I already looked at everything

975
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,879
uh and we had them analyze it and vote

976
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,160
on you know each category we had Verma

977
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,000
compost we had food waste compost we had

978
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:35,159
uh thermophilic compost we had static

979
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,400
compost we had yard waste compost and

980
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:40,739
you name it horse horse manure compost

981
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,780
and each one of them looked at the

982
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:44,098
samples and then voted based on

983
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,920
appearance

984
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:49,019
only one person out of those 10 judges

985
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,820
actually sniffed it and that was the

986
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:53,159
soil scientist

987
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,160
and then when it was all done and they

988
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:58,319
all voted at the end of the competition

989
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,779
I I stood up and I said hey

990
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,160
you know I I really appreciate you guys

991
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,200
taking the time to come out here and do

992
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:08,098
this but I want to point out something

993
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:11,699
that you guys basically determined the

994
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:14,099
value of the compost on appearance only

995
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:17,759
and everyone kind of looked around at

996
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:20,880
each other like oh [ __ ] you know

997
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,060
he's right how how are we

998
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,500
qualifying or quantifying why this one's

999
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,779
better than that one

1000
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,838
by appearance

1001
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,060
so I point out hey we did no testing so

1002
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:35,219
we have no idea which one's nutritional

1003
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:36,420
and which one's not

1004
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:39,000
um we don't know which ones could

1005
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,619
potentially have high salt or or heavy

1006
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,619
metals like the horse manure compost

1007
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,420
very common to have high aluminum in in

1008
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:50,160
horse manure as well as high salts

1009
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:54,780
sodiums on both detrimental to plants

1010
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:57,239
um and and also I biologically scoped

1011
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,700
all of these but that wasn't even taken

1012
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,500
into consideration as to

1013
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:04,139
again

1014
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,960
stating that this was better than the

1015
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:08,578
other ones in that category and it was

1016
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,980
extremely eye-opening like that

1017
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:12,839
conversation that the room just exploded

1018
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,300
inside conversations at that point

1019
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:17,099
everybody was like oh my God I never

1020
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,760
thought about that way and so it was

1021
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:23,460
really eye-opening to basically put that

1022
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,740
level of of experience in a room

1023
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,220
together and and turn them on their

1024
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:32,779
heads because they basically had no real

1025
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:37,299
evidence to determine which was better

1026
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:40,280
than the other ones except for visually

1027
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,539
[Music]

1028
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,060
all right so let's go to our next

1029
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:47,099
category so the next one

1030
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:49,259
um uh I kind of just put in its own

1031
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,338
category because I really just thought

1032
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,060
that

1033
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:52,679
um

1034
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:56,759
um

1035
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:59,039
worm castings were just like a a part of

1036
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,359
all compost and that was it

1037
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,719
um but then

1038
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:05,759
um folks might recall uh Chandler from

1039
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:08,039
uh from wormies who was on the show a

1040
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,599
couple episodes ago talking about worms

1041
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:11,219
and

1042
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,820
um like he was kind enough to send me

1043
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:16,799
out a bag of uh the wormies Verma

1044
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,320
compost that they make so that I could

1045
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,480
see what a Verma compost was like and

1046
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,579
dude it's it's unlike anything else that

1047
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:29,639
I would call compost

1048
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:33,420
um it is uh it's it's uh it's smaller it

1049
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:37,019
smells sweet it is it seems more uniform

1050
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:41,460
it seems a little bit heavier

1051
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:43,380
um uh you know when the when you know

1052
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,960
again something that's called compost

1053
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,760
right but really you were talking about

1054
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,639
the pass-through

1055
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,260
um uh worm bins earlier that stuff that

1056
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,920
comes out at the bottom which is the the

1057
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:00,060
worms

1058
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,220
um the worm casting so they're poop with

1059
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:04,380
um you know whatever kind of like soil

1060
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:06,419
or hay that might have been thrown in

1061
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,720
there to kind of even it out and make it

1062
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:13,680
a pleasant living environment I guess

1063
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:17,219
um that stuff while called compost is

1064
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:19,618
really its own thing and

1065
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:22,078
um and so let's talk about that itself

1066
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:25,140
so so you know you get a uh you know

1067
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:30,240
somebody gives you Verma compost and and

1068
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:33,539
it's you know vastly worm castings

1069
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,699
um let's let's talk about what what the

1070
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:37,858
the attributes of that compost would be

1071
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:42,059
okay that's great

1072
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:45,838
um so when you are um

1073
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:48,000
doing Verma compost at scale you have to

1074
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,159
start with betting right everybody you

1075
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,480
can't just throw food in a bin and throw

1076
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,739
some worms in there because they won't

1077
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,780
survive the whole thing will go

1078
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:57,118
anaerobic and and the worms will turn to

1079
00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:00,300
slime so you need to create a bedding

1080
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,880
that the worms can Retreat to

1081
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,280
um to do their thing whether it's breed

1082
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,740
or or rest

1083
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,740
um and then an area for them to work

1084
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:12,899
through to get their food they don't

1085
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:14,459
want to live in decomposing food they

1086
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,838
want to live in their bedding but they

1087
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,019
want to be able to eat

1088
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:22,619
so think of it that way all right so

1089
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:25,259
um and again thank you for for observing

1090
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,000
the weight of it because that's really

1091
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,599
really important to understand that's

1092
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,599
why Verma compost is so unlike other

1093
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:35,940
forms of compost because it's pushing on

1094
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,280
the Moa mineral-associated organic

1095
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,318
matter side so mineral Associated

1096
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,260
organic matter is highly stable

1097
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:48,420
long-term in soil and provides great

1098
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:51,480
benefit to helping the the the soil food

1099
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,220
web to begin to build Aggregates micro

1100
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,539
and macro Aggregates which is important

1101
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:57,598
for soil Health but I'm not going to go

1102
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:59,818
down there so why is Verma compost so

1103
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,680
much different well those worms have

1104
00:44:59,818 --> 00:45:05,460
chewed through

1105
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:08,098
that material consuming bacteria

1106
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:11,220
and pooping out

1107
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:13,440
um nutrients highly nutrient dense

1108
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:15,299
little poops because they're really

1109
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,679
there to eat the biology they don't

1110
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,480
really want to eat the nutrients per se

1111
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,460
um they they will try they will help

1112
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,000
move those nutrients throughout the

1113
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:29,400
entire uh worm bed which is again

1114
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,280
mutually beneficial because now you're

1115
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,619
getting an even uh

1116
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,119
even amount of nutrients throughout the

1117
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:38,400
entire system it's not like this

1118
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,680
pocket's going to be heavily ladened

1119
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,720
with with this nutrient or that mineral

1120
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:43,919
it's been pushed through the whole

1121
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,279
system

1122
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,700
so yeah worm castings are very special

1123
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,519
because they are uh very nutrient dense

1124
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:54,960
and highly biologically available in

1125
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,719
other words if you put those worm

1126
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,980
castings into or top dress and then

1127
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:05,000
apply a really good compost extract

1128
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:07,260
biologically Rich compost extract or tea

1129
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,579
those those things will be broken down

1130
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:14,339
extremely fast and stored in the biology

1131
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:15,660
so that they're not mobile and again

1132
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,000
this is really important to understand

1133
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:20,219
nutrients if you just take raw nutrient

1134
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,260
like a secondary tertiary metabolite you

1135
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:24,179
put it on the soil and it rains that

1136
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,640
stuff's gone it's going to get washed

1137
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:29,098
through and down into the lower soil

1138
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,639
systems where it's no longer going to be

1139
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:34,740
as available for the plants so you've

1140
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:37,318
you've you've gone backwards You've Lost

1141
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:39,598
Your minerals You've Lost Your nutrients

1142
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:42,659
so that's why it's so important to have

1143
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,700
that biology on on high numbers so they

1144
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:46,799
can consume those secondary in tertiary

1145
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:48,419
metabolites stored them in their biota

1146
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,900
in their body

1147
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,579
so that now when it rains they're stuck

1148
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,220
to their biofilm that stuff's not going

1149
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:58,859
anywhere the only time that stuff that

1150
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:01,739
nutrient in in that bacteria is going to

1151
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:05,098
go somewhere is when that bacteria is

1152
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:09,598
consumed by a protozoa or starved to

1153
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:11,460
death by a lack of exudate and becomes

1154
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,338
available to the plant

1155
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:16,619
so that's why worm castings are just so

1156
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:18,779
special is because they are basically

1157
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:21,358
secondary and tertiary metabolites ready

1158
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:24,359
to be consumed by biology which will

1159
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:27,539
then store it as a a nutrient bank

1160
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:30,000
system for when the plant wants them

1161
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:32,519
special stuff yeah it totally special

1162
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,858
stuff and and um you know I copped to

1163
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:37,079
this you know when when we did the uh

1164
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:39,299
you know uh you know making friends with

1165
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:41,460
Worm episodes like I don't know three or

1166
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,700
four back with uh with Chandler

1167
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:47,400
um and like I'm honestly new to worms

1168
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:49,739
like I I like worms I make sure that

1169
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,119
I've got worms in my pots but but mostly

1170
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:54,479
I would just I've always thought about

1171
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,519
them aerating the soil and and but it

1172
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,920
wasn't until you know we talked with

1173
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:02,838
Chandler that I realized that they are

1174
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:06,119
these like super efficient processing

1175
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:09,318
machines biological machines that are

1176
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:12,059
just taking these um

1177
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:14,159
this biology that's not super accessible

1178
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:16,139
to us or our plans and running it

1179
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,598
through their bodies and pooping out the

1180
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:21,299
other end something that is Rich and

1181
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:24,539
valuable to us and this is that's pretty

1182
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,280
badass yeah it is yeah it is all right

1183
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:27,059
so let's go to the the fifth category

1184
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,160
now

1185
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:31,318
um we're down to our last two here so

1186
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:33,420
the fifth one it kind of I'm not sure if

1187
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:36,119
it totally fits in this in this group

1188
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:38,940
but um since this is where

1189
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:42,300
um my curiosity started for this episode

1190
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:44,460
today I definitely want to include it so

1191
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,539
um for the last I don't know five or six

1192
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,420
years

1193
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:51,719
um I have been using

1194
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,659
um uh both of the the compost tea making

1195
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:57,659
products uh from green bicycles

1196
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:59,879
um and uh uh Kevin chaudry turned me

1197
00:48:57,659 --> 00:49:01,019
onto this stuff uh one day when I was

1198
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,780
visiting

1199
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:06,358
um Wonderland Nursery because uh Patrick

1200
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,599
the founder of green bicycles had come

1201
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:12,659
by and he had you know this huge 35

1202
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:15,900
gallon uh container of this this this

1203
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:17,578
what looked like powder and Kevin says

1204
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,380
you know I swear by this stuff it makes

1205
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,300
great compost teas you should you should

1206
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,579
try it and so I have and I loved it I

1207
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,318
got great results and I've been using it

1208
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:28,619
for years

1209
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:31,139
um and so so the stuff from green

1210
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,700
bicycles though is very unlike the other

1211
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:34,379
stuff that we've talked about so far

1212
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,899
today because

1213
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,780
um the green bicycles products is is not

1214
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,619
like uh food Refuge or

1215
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,040
um

1216
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:47,760
um Glon clippings or or cuttings from my

1217
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:50,639
cannabis plans it is a blend of what I

1218
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,700
think of more as soil amendments right

1219
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,739
so there's you know there's there's

1220
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:57,239
guano and feather meal and crab shell

1221
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:00,899
and you know the kinds of stuff that

1222
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:04,439
that we all in the regenerative scene

1223
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:07,200
um are known to use to build our soil

1224
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,780
and and so um he's got two versions of

1225
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:12,239
the product uh one of it with

1226
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,099
um molasses that's dried in there and

1227
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,899
and then one that's not and the one

1228
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:17,400
without the Molasses is kind of seen

1229
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,980
more as a soil amendment and the one

1230
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,539
with molasses is is

1231
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:25,679
um is used more as a compost tea and so

1232
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:28,800
so I've been using this stuff for years

1233
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,480
but it wasn't until again I started

1234
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,560
following

1235
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:38,280
um uh um you know the wormies uh

1236
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,199
Instagram and Chandler's Instagram uh uh

1237
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,819
I think it's jet Gardens

1238
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:44,219
um that I that I really started

1239
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:48,119
realizing that the stuff I was making

1240
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:50,399
compost tea air quotes out of

1241
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,640
um it was not it didn't look like

1242
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:57,900
compost to me anymore it was it was a

1243
00:50:53,639 --> 00:51:00,239
bunch of amendments with molasses and so

1244
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:03,720
I I would always like take that and put

1245
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:06,598
that in my um my bubbler that I got from

1246
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:09,058
t-lab and um and it'll Bubble Up and it

1247
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:12,539
makes this like beautiful compost tea

1248
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:16,319
that smells great and and my plants have

1249
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:18,779
have done well on it but but but

1250
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:22,619
um I I'm like where where's the biology

1251
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,720
part of it and and is this its own

1252
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:27,358
category which which I have just started

1253
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:29,159
calling a nutrient tea which that

1254
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:30,838
category may or may not exist but like

1255
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:33,299
I'm on my own path right I just came

1256
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:35,338
across it my own and everybody else

1257
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,039
probably already knows about this so so

1258
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:41,759
I've been using this and so so a I know

1259
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:44,219
it works B I love the ingredients

1260
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,559
um but C I don't know if bubbling it is

1261
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:48,419
actually doing me any good because

1262
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,420
they're I don't think that there's any

1263
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:54,838
living biology but there's got to be

1264
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:57,720
biology that assisted up that was you

1265
00:51:54,838 --> 00:52:00,480
know on the feather meal on the crab

1266
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:03,179
shell you know contained in the back

1267
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,240
guano so so there's like like there's

1268
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:07,858
like cysted up sleeping biology in there

1269
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,019
I'm guessing

1270
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:13,558
um and then I go ahead and you know fire

1271
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:16,559
it up and then I get nutrition with I'm

1272
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:19,619
guessing some amount of biology so so

1273
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,000
please speak to that which is a very

1274
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:23,579
different

1275
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,179
it's a very different product to put in

1276
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:28,740
in the same bucket as as compost but I

1277
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:31,199
really feel like it's got its own

1278
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:34,159
personality and I don't know how to

1279
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,960
resolve it with the rest of this stuff

1280
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:42,239
oh it definitely has a personality and I

1281
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:44,420
I appreciate the the term nutrients

1282
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:48,058
solution or or

1283
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:49,619
nutrient tea would be the appropriate

1284
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:52,500
way to describe it

1285
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:56,059
um the big difference between compost

1286
00:52:52,500 --> 00:53:00,239
extract and teas versus a nutrient

1287
00:52:56,059 --> 00:53:03,119
tea would be the lack of humic acid the

1288
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:05,058
lack of fulvic acids

1289
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,740
um those are

1290
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:11,640
biological superfoods

1291
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:14,759
so basically it's like a One-Stop shop

1292
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:15,719
for for your entire soil food web by

1293
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,180
using

1294
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:20,818
um you know these these compost extracts

1295
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:21,960
that are very high in humic or folic

1296
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:24,119
acids

1297
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,579
so that being said now we've we've

1298
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:30,358
separated these two by that one critical

1299
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:32,160
ingredient now let's talk about the two

1300
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:34,259
different varieties one with molasses

1301
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:36,659
one without molasses I would tend to

1302
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,140
believe the one with molasses would be

1303
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:41,879
working a lot quicker so a short term

1304
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:46,019
whereas the one without molasses would

1305
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:48,119
be more of a long-term nutrient T and by

1306
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:51,599
that I mean that when you apply that

1307
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,160
nutrient solution onto the soil

1308
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,440
um you're you're assuming that that

1309
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:57,299
solution is going to be absorbed by the

1310
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,059
existing organic matter

1311
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:02,880
um and then slowly released by uh the

1312
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:05,160
bacteria that are mining it and storing

1313
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,960
it in themselves and then they become

1314
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,539
available to the protozoa which pooped

1315
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,599
out to the plant Etc so one is a short

1316
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:15,239
term one is long term the short-term one

1317
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:18,180
with the Molasses is going to stimulate

1318
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:20,459
all kinds of microbial activity we know

1319
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:22,799
for sure that that the bacteria just

1320
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:26,099
love molasses

1321
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,960
um there was I I years ago I it got

1322
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:30,000
explained to me and I forget what it is

1323
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,000
but it has something to do with the fact

1324
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,940
that the sugar has only been processed

1325
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,420
to a certain point it hasn't been

1326
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:41,159
refined yet and that's why the bacteria

1327
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,139
love it so much because there's again

1328
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:44,578
the secondary tertiary metabolites

1329
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:46,558
haven't been refined to a point where

1330
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,579
that they're more difficult to break

1331
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,940
down

1332
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:53,220
so you're going to have

1333
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:58,260
biofilms built up on all of those uh

1334
00:54:53,219 --> 00:55:01,259
nutrient inputs so just recently NASA uh

1335
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:04,140
came back with an article about how they

1336
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:06,300
had slapped some biofilm on the outside

1337
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:08,879
of the space station at three years ago

1338
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,800
and they scraped it this year and

1339
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,099
brought it inside and yes it was still

1340
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,960
live even though it had been living

1341
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:17,700
in space which is you know

1342
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,818
how could anything live in space right

1343
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:22,039
well it goes to show that that biology

1344
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,358
is

1345
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:27,000
incredibly resilient

1346
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:30,739
but it also goes to show that the

1347
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,838
biofilm is so powerful that it can

1348
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:35,939
protect those organisms pretty much in

1349
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,039
any Con in any environment you can

1350
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:39,539
possibly come up with

1351
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,579
um at some point I I tend to believe

1352
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:43,500
that we will find

1353
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,599
um that perhaps life even exists in

1354
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,760
Flames uh that there's some kind of

1355
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,460
biology that we haven't quite uncovered

1356
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,200
yet but that's a whole nother story yeah

1357
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,940
that sounds like a whole different

1358
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:56,239
meaning for the shaping fire podcast

1359
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:59,818
name right right

1360
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:04,558
we'll get there someday hopefully but um

1361
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:06,838
anyway just stay stay on topic here so

1362
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,700
that being said that yes when you when

1363
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:10,500
you add the dry molasses and you put it

1364
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:12,299
in water and you bubble it you you're

1365
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:16,260
going to

1366
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:18,300
um get a bacterial explosion uh plume

1367
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,940
for lack of better words and you're

1368
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,940
going to be pluming out the organisms

1369
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:26,700
that we're consuming

1370
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,880
had had created their biofilm and and

1371
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:32,399
their protection their home on those

1372
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,000
individual uh nutrients whether it's

1373
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,980
crab meal horse uh whatever uh feather

1374
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,440
meal crab meal

1375
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:43,318
calcium whatever it is but they will

1376
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,260
have bacteria that specifically mine

1377
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:48,300
those components and now you've grown

1378
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,800
them out so guess what when you pour

1379
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,019
them on your soil

1380
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,780
you're going to have an explosion of of

1381
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:57,358
the biology that has that nutrient

1382
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,579
stored up in its Pantry that is now

1383
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,380
going to be consumed by the protozoa and

1384
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:03,800
nematodes that you have present in your

1385
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:07,740
soil system or or the or the

1386
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:09,720
microorthropods to not forget about them

1387
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:11,219
um and the worms don't forget about them

1388
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:14,699
right because they're all working

1389
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:18,058
together to release this nutrients

1390
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:22,318
um back to the plant and so um that's

1391
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:25,260
that's what I would say to to this uh

1392
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:28,259
green bicycle uh nutrient solution is

1393
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:30,780
that it's it's an amendment but yes it

1394
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:33,359
does have some uh biological

1395
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,460
constituents that are available on those

1396
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:39,058
nutrients that mine those specific

1397
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:42,179
nutrients so very targeted biology cool

1398
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:44,099
and you know I I started with it just

1399
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:45,779
because you know Kevin chaudry said so

1400
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:47,519
right and I trusted his opinion and it's

1401
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,859
worked for me for years and it's it's

1402
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,858
funny that now like whatever five six

1403
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:54,299
years ago you know later now I'm really

1404
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:57,239
getting to the point that I can even

1405
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,519
think about more what it is

1406
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:02,098
um so I'm you know it it works for me

1407
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,119
even without knowing exactly what it is

1408
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,920
so

1409
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,599
um so I like that kind of product I

1410
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,338
wanna I wanna clean up before we go on

1411
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:11,338
to the next topic I want to clean up a

1412
00:58:08,338 --> 00:58:13,858
couple of the things that I got wrong uh

1413
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:15,058
um so wormies Instagram is obviously

1414
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:18,480
easy because you know how to spell

1415
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:20,819
wormies but but Chandler michalski who

1416
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,619
was the guest for the for the you know

1417
00:58:20,818 --> 00:58:24,300
getting friendly with worms shaping Fire

1418
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:25,619
episode like three back I got his

1419
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,140
Instagram wrong I looked it up real

1420
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:30,900
quick it's actually jet house Gardens

1421
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:32,578
and so nothing worse than you plug

1422
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,200
somebody whose Instagram is very

1423
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:36,359
educational for you and then you plug it

1424
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:38,159
wrong you know I didn't want to

1425
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:39,960
interrupt you but I was going to clarify

1426
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,000
that right I'm glad you did I'm glad you

1427
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,679
did right cool yeah so I wanna you know

1428
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,139
I want to do Channel or solid so I

1429
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:48,480
wanted to clean that up and then um and

1430
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:51,779
then anybody who is interested in

1431
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,579
looking at that green bicycles products

1432
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,700
um uh it's kind of weird because green

1433
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:59,220
is actually spelled

1434
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:01,139
g-r-e-a-n and so that's that's you know

1435
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:03,659
that's Trixie and will totally destroy

1436
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:05,578
your Google results without it and the

1437
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:07,139
the two products that I mean it's their

1438
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:08,760
only two products but it's the two ones

1439
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:11,879
that I've used all these years is the

1440
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:14,220
Happy Endings compost tea mix and the

1441
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,920
ocean Bounty flowering mix

1442
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:18,058
so um for for anybody who wants to look

1443
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,460
into that and you can get that stuff on

1444
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:23,220
Amazon and their website so all right so

1445
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,559
moving right along so so we're coming up

1446
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:27,739
here to the end of this like huge first

1447
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:29,880
set and and and

1448
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:31,679
the the compost we're going to talk

1449
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,619
about next number six this is actually

1450
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:36,659
going to set us up for set two because

1451
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:38,338
we're going to talk about this variety

1452
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:41,219
of compost

1453
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:43,679
um during most of probably all of set

1454
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:46,199
two so so

1455
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,399
um so just just set us up there Leighton

1456
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:52,019
and then and then I'll take us to

1457
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:54,960
commercial so the sixth category is the

1458
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:56,338
stuff that you sent me man like like I

1459
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,780
had a problem in my you know I know

1460
00:59:56,338 --> 00:59:59,099
you're a compost expert you can solve

1461
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,140
for all these people you got this crazy

1462
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,720
ass lab in your in your garage and

1463
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:05,460
another one in Connecticut like like I

1464
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:07,199
know you're like mad scientist compost

1465
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,280
guy but like I had not actually ever

1466
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,858
seen

1467
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,359
like what you make right like I've

1468
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:14,880
always I've always appreciated you for

1469
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:16,440
our our friendship and conversation but

1470
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,480
but I I you know I never seen any of

1471
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,400
your compost and so

1472
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,199
um so I had a fungus nap problem which

1473
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,639
we'll talk more about in the third set

1474
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:25,739
but you're all like hey man let me let

1475
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:28,139
me send you something to fix that and

1476
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:31,558
and you you shipped me up

1477
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:35,098
um uh two different bags of this compost

1478
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:37,440
which was unlike any other compost that

1479
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:41,220
I had ever come across

1480
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,740
um it was you know a small granular and

1481
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:47,699
it was rich and it smelled so good I

1482
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:50,338
wanted to eat it and it like I mean not

1483
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:52,679
to sound too woo-woo I I feel like I

1484
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:54,779
felt it alive I felt like I was getting

1485
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:57,000
Vibes off of it like when I opened it

1486
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:59,880
like I was like you know I got like a

1487
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,699
hit of the smell and I'm like whoa what

1488
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:06,079
is this this is very unlike anything

1489
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:09,838
else that I have been given as compost

1490
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:12,359
and then um you know you told me to just

1491
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:15,119
uh you know um uh I think you had me

1492
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:18,058
Brew it and and then and then I put it

1493
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:20,519
put it on and it caused all of this like

1494
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:23,280
immediate biological change which we're

1495
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:26,818
gonna talk about more in set two

1496
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,559
but this after talking you with talking

1497
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:31,619
to you more about it

1498
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:34,319
um you explained to me why this kind of

1499
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:37,318
compost is in a category all of its own

1500
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:40,079
so so please explain what's different

1501
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:43,380
about this cat this category of compost

1502
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,119
that I had never even considered and and

1503
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,858
then set us up and then and then I'll

1504
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,920
take us to commercial

1505
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:52,019
okay so we'll get into the process in

1506
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,960
the next set but bottom line is it's a

1507
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:57,780
biological inoculant

1508
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,179
um the foundation of it is Palm so

1509
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:03,240
particulate organic matter so you you

1510
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:06,358
notice that really fine particulate but

1511
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:08,338
you also noticed it was super fluffy and

1512
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:11,818
that's the key to this uh that

1513
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:14,759
fluffiness allows for gas exchange it

1514
01:02:11,818 --> 01:02:17,639
allows the for heavy colonization of of

1515
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,480
you know huh

1516
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:25,199
very very diverse biology

1517
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,940
um in a way that uh does not force

1518
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,980
competition

1519
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,900
so not everybody's fighting for the same

1520
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,280
resource they're just there in

1521
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,858
suspension

1522
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:37,740
um just to be woken up and and

1523
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:39,838
by you whether you're Brewing them or

1524
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:43,019
top dressing with them

1525
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:45,599
um so basically it's look at it like

1526
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:47,838
Condominiums I'm building you know every

1527
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:51,660
one of those tiny little

1528
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:53,699
particulate is a giant condominium a

1529
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:57,838
City full of all different types of

1530
01:02:53,699 --> 01:03:00,719
biology that are there basically just

1531
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:03,838
waiting to be provided with the

1532
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:07,019
environment that they can really

1533
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:09,298
um you know expand it and and thrive in

1534
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:11,519
so that's why that's different and we'll

1535
01:03:09,298 --> 01:03:13,440
get into the ingredients in the process

1536
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:16,019
uh in the next set

1537
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,338
hit the hit hit the key thing for me

1538
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:18,960
though which is

1539
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:20,699
um the fact that it's it's not a thermal

1540
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,480
compost

1541
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:27,779
now it is not and and in most ways it

1542
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,858
would be considered uh immature and the

1543
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,900
reason

1544
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:34,980
um it would be considered immature is

1545
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:38,519
because when I take this start product

1546
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:40,858
which is the the biological compost that

1547
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:42,780
I made uh non-thermophilic we call it

1548
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:44,098
cold composting

1549
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:46,920
um I screen it

1550
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:48,900
uh numerous times and so I'm screening

1551
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,000
out the big stuff

1552
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:54,720
I'm using

1553
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:57,780
forces to break off all of the organisms

1554
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,759
the human can folic acids to break down

1555
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:03,839
the little pieces that are tend to be

1556
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:06,119
clumped together or sheared off of a

1557
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:08,880
bigger piece of organic matter so it's

1558
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:11,818
those mechanical processes and then the

1559
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:15,260
screening that allows me to get that

1560
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:18,900
poem those fine little particulates

1561
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:21,119
and suspend them in a solution so that

1562
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:23,099
they can be colonized by all the

1563
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,619
different diverse bacteria and biology

1564
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:28,079
that I've put into play and this idea

1565
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:30,119
that it's a cold compost I haven't heard

1566
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,280
that term before I like it

1567
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:34,200
um you know when we talked about this

1568
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,880
earlier in the week it was interesting

1569
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,679
because you said you know all of the

1570
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,140
other compost all right probably not the

1571
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,879
vermiculture but but most of the other

1572
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:44,578
compost that we have talked about today

1573
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,220
they have all been heated to like what

1574
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:49,440
165 or something because because people

1575
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:51,659
are trying to you know kill the seeds

1576
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:55,500
and you know make it make it little more

1577
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:58,318
inert but but really that's also killing

1578
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:01,260
all the microbes which is really what

1579
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:03,539
what so many of us natural farmers are

1580
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,579
chasing after and it really astonished

1581
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:07,318
me that you know to realize that I'm

1582
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:10,019
always thinking about

1583
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:12,659
um using my compost teas because I want

1584
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:16,798
to pour microbes into my soil to help

1585
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:19,798
buoy the rhizosphere but really

1586
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:22,559
um if it's a thermal compost it means

1587
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:26,818
that like that stuff's like mostly been

1588
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:30,540
wiped out already versus this

1589
01:05:26,818 --> 01:05:31,739
cold compost where even though we'll

1590
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:33,298
talk more about this in a second it

1591
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:35,939
sounds like it's dangerous because it's

1592
01:05:33,298 --> 01:05:39,239
all like wild in there like what I

1593
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:43,099
imagine I'm doing with a thermal compost

1594
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:46,979
tea really is happening at a much

1595
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:49,798
smaller level than if I were to use a

1596
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:51,480
cold compost tea

1597
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:54,358
correct and the one thing you're missing

1598
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:57,240
too is the most important reason to go

1599
01:05:54,358 --> 01:06:00,058
thermophilic is to kill pathogens all

1600
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:03,598
right so they kill weed seeds yes that's

1601
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:06,000
a byproduct of of the process but the

1602
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,500
goal is to

1603
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,199
um knock back all of the potential

1604
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,119
pathogens remember a lot of a lot of

1605
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,318
compost is based on manures right

1606
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,599
high-end

1607
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:18,480
um anaerobic digestion which is the

1608
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:21,440
other piece that we did talk about

1609
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,000
um but the thermophilic component is to

1610
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,679
basically

1611
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,440
provide the same thing as an anaerobic

1612
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:30,899
digestion you're killing everything

1613
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:35,159
and then starting over starting fresh

1614
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:37,680
and so yeah that's that's why

1615
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:39,960
I went to

1616
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:44,279
um cold composting was because I could

1617
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:46,139
not get the the biological diversity

1618
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,460
that I was looking for when I went

1619
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:51,000
thermophilic

1620
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:53,358
but again I don't use any manures I

1621
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:58,679
don't use any food waste I use purely

1622
01:06:53,358 --> 01:07:01,019
vegan compost so this is just plants all

1623
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:04,199
right so we will dig into that uh even

1624
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:06,960
more uh for set two and uh and if you're

1625
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:09,659
still with us uh I appreciate you this

1626
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,838
is this is a solid hour first set which

1627
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:16,078
is the longest first set I've ever had

1628
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:19,558
um but um I care very much about this

1629
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:23,339
topic and um and there's no way that I

1630
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:24,900
wanted to do this topic again short

1631
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:27,538
shrift right like if we're gonna do it

1632
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,980
let's freaking do it and and so if

1633
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:31,079
you're still here with us and you're

1634
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,298
caring about all this like you're our

1635
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:35,519
kind of people and I really appreciate

1636
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:37,079
that you're here so um we're gonna go

1637
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,179
ahead and take a short break and be

1692
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,219
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1693
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:43,140
growing is so valued by Farmers is

1694
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:45,179
because the mycelium networks in the

1695
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,759
soil remain established from year to

1696
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:49,500
year and we know these fungal networks

1697
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,838
are essential because they are the

1698
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:54,060
nutrient super highways that extend far

1699
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:56,640
and wide in the substrate to feed your

1700
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:59,100
plants the trouble with growing in New

1701
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,260
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

1702
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:03,660
is that it takes most of the plant's

1703
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:06,020
life just to create these mycelium

1704
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:08,099

eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1790
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:30,658
so here we are at set two during set one

1791
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:32,819
we looked at a wide variety of the

1792
01:13:30,658 --> 01:13:36,238
things that we come in contact with that

1793
01:13:32,819 --> 01:13:38,639
is labeled compost and we did our best

1794
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:41,218
to make sense of them and we found

1795
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,619
ourselves at the end with um you know

1796
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:46,140
focusing on the kind of compost that

1797
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:47,219
that I think that I'm usually looking

1798

types the you know the curated compost

1801
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:55,738
and the vermiculture compost and the

1802
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:57,899
nutrient compost like like all of that

1803
01:13:55,738 --> 01:14:03,119
stuff is are things that I use in my

1804
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:05,099
garden but most of the time myself as a

1805
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:07,079
natural farmer interested in

1806
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,239
regenerative

1807
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:13,319
um you know cultivation and feeding the

1808
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:16,799
rhizosphere I'm really wanting to you

1809
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:20,340
know feed and add microbe life I want to

1810
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,860
add biology and

1811
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,420
um and and so we we ended the first set

1812
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:27,119
talking about

1813
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:29,399
um a cold compost that have not been

1814
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,800
heated that where all the biology is

1815
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:33,119
still alive and so in this set we're

1816
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:36,000
going to talk

1817
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:38,640
um a bit about the difference between

1818
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,399
that and the and the other composts and

1819
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,920
the biology and also I'm very interested

1820
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:46,259
in um you know if if one of the reasons

1821
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,100
we heat thermal compost is get rid of

1822
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:51,900
the pathogens that makes this unheated

1823
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:54,900
microbe inoculant this cold compost

1824
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:57,238
sound like wild like the wild west so so

1825
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:59,639
so so let's start

1826
01:14:57,238 --> 01:15:02,218
um with the difference you you have

1827
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,440
spoken on this on this show before uh

1828
01:15:02,219 --> 01:15:09,719
briefly about the difference between

1829
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:12,839
soil science and soil biology and

1830
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:14,460
um you know I I my you know back of the

1831
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:17,039
envelope is just like soil Sciences

1832
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:19,380
nutrition and minerals and soil biology

1833
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:21,539
is living stuff but but honestly we

1834
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:23,520
haven't gone into you know in depth so

1835
01:15:21,539 --> 01:15:25,140
far so I could I could have it wrong so

1836
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,580
so why don't we start there there and

1837
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:29,579
then we can start to hang the rest of

1838
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:31,100
the conversation on that Layton all

1839
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:33,479
right that sounds good and you know

1840
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:35,340
thank you again Chango for doing this

1841
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:37,259
because you we're we're having a

1842
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:40,079
conversation that has needed to happen

1843
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:43,140
for many years now about you know

1844
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,359
whether it's a compost is should be

1845
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:47,760
called compost or whether it needs other

1846
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:50,039
names and and you know just recently in

1847
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,739
the last couple years I've seen you know

1848
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:55,260
like particulate organic matter and Men

1849
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:58,559
associate organic matter come about as

1850
01:15:55,260 --> 01:16:01,079
as words that are provide value

1851
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:03,120
um and and this next part which is also

1852
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:04,738
equally as important is is the

1853
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:06,719
understanding that soil is actually

1854
01:16:04,738 --> 01:16:09,299
three components

1855
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:11,219
is the physical sansil clay and organic

1856
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:13,739
matter and their relationship which is

1857
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:16,579
very important second is soil chemistry

1858
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:19,500
and third is soil biology soil science

1859
01:16:16,579 --> 01:16:22,198
base everything on

1860
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:25,198
two of those three pieces which is the

1861
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:26,939
physical and the chemical and this is

1862
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:28,139
due to

1863
01:16:26,939 --> 01:16:31,319
um

1864
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:34,199
economic based

1865
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:36,658
systems and like human reductionism

1866
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:39,719
right we always we always value life

1867
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:41,579
last right it seems to be the way it

1868
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:43,980
really seems to be the way especially if

1869
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:46,340
you look at where we are as a species at

1870
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:49,019
this point in time

1871
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:51,779
we won't go there all right but

1872
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:54,780
basically soil science is is chemistry

1873
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:58,019
heavy everything has been based on

1874
01:16:54,779 --> 01:17:00,539
building fertilizers to grow more crops

1875
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:02,520
to feed more people regardless of

1876
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:06,260
nutritional value which makes no sense

1877
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:08,960
to me the only real way to achieve

1878
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:11,239
nutrient dense food is through biology

1879
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:14,279
it's that critical

1880
01:17:11,238 --> 01:17:18,119
biogeochemical interactions that allow

1881
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:21,539
that plant to pull up these nutrients

1882
01:17:18,119 --> 01:17:24,920
um and and and regulate itself as to

1883
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:27,479
what it wants instead of being force-fed

1884
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:29,779
NPK so

1885
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:32,939
that is why there's this huge disconnect

1886
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:35,460
in soil science versus soil biology

1887
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:38,639
until Dr Lane Ingham

1888
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:41,640
made the world aware that there is life

1889
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:45,480
under their feet people didn't even

1890
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:48,600
consider soil biology as as a real thing

1891
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:52,379
and so in many ways she's pioneered the

1892
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:55,320
eye-opening of of the masses to the fact

1893
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:58,219
that there is more uh going on in the

1894
01:17:55,319 --> 01:18:01,079
soil than just physical and chemical

1895
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:05,939
that there's this critical Bridge called

1896
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:08,039
biological that allows the chemistry to

1897
01:18:05,939 --> 01:18:10,979
flow in and out of the physical

1898
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:13,319
components and into the plant directly

1899
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:15,479
so that's that's an important

1900
01:18:13,319 --> 01:18:18,439
conversation needs to happen is that you

1901
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:21,299
know the soil science world has got to

1902
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:24,599
knock down the Ivory Towers of just

1903
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:26,060
chemistry and really start to open up to

1904
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:30,060
this

1905
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:32,719
interdisciplinary mode of operation that

1906
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:35,820
will unlock these really important

1907
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:37,560
Secrets I sent you a paper recently

1908
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:39,179
which I'm sure you're going to enjoy

1909
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,420
reading time and time again because

1910
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:45,539
there's just so much information in that

1911
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:47,279
they're basically kind of explains that

1912
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:49,380
this this

1913
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:51,300
organic matter we're not going to call

1914
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,159
it compost anymore it's organic matter

1915
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,980
it's just in different phases of

1916
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:59,698
decomposition

1917
01:18:54,979 --> 01:19:01,079
provide this incredibly powerful

1918
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:04,198
home

1919
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:06,899
um City uh Globe considered a planet

1920
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:09,419
that that aggregate is a planet and

1921
01:19:06,899 --> 01:19:11,339
inside that plane it is all of this

1922
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:15,239
magic that's going on that that's

1923
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:18,900
protecting itself it's evolving

1924
01:19:15,238 --> 01:19:22,019
um it's it's producing uh more inoculant

1925
01:19:18,899 --> 01:19:26,339
for for more expansion for for better

1926
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:28,020
soil structure to to accept moisture the

1927
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:30,000
more moisture that goes in that gets

1928
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:32,159
held in those Aggregates the more

1929
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,840
densely populated they can become the

1930
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:35,519
more they can clean the water the more

1931
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,039
they can provide foods for other

1932
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,360
organisms so it's really the the

1933
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:43,679
foundation of everything is that

1934
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:46,079
biogeochemical processes that are

1935
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:49,819
occurring with inside that aggregate now

1936
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:52,198
is that aggregate uh poem or moan well

1937
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:54,658
that's the thing is when you get into

1938
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:57,178
mineral Associated organic matter you

1939
01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:59,460
get into a environment where you're

1940
01:19:57,179 --> 01:20:02,100
compacted now you're you're you don't

1941
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:04,800
have of the gas or air exchange I should

1942
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:07,199
say you don't have the CO2 leaving and

1943
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:10,760
the oxygen or the air atmospheric air

1944
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:15,000
coming down you don't have the the same

1945
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:18,420
ability to to aggregate that's why it's

1946
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,000
so much more stable than poem

1947
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:22,619
um so I'm sorry I got Way Off Track

1948
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,619
there but I think I think that's

1949
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:27,539
important to really differentiate the

1950
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:31,439
difference between

1951
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:33,600
um these phases of of decomposition sure

1952
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:35,219
I'll bring you back in but but since you

1953
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,620
mentioned the paper that you sent me

1954
01:20:35,219 --> 01:20:42,420
yesterday we might as well plug it and

1955
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:45,300
um I will also have a link to it on the

1956
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:46,679
page for this episode on the shaping

1957
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:49,020
fire website

1958
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:51,420
um but the but the but the the the the

1959
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:54,420
the the science paper which was a

1960
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:58,260
fantastic read last night is called will

1961
01:20:54,420 --> 01:21:04,679
fungi solve the carbon dilemma and it's

1962
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:06,719
by uh s Emilia hanula and Ellie mauryan

1963
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:09,779
um anyway it's it's it's a fascinating

1964
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:13,198
read and um and we'll be talking more

1965
01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:15,658
about the the fungal aspects of this

1966
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:18,719
paper you know towards towards the

1967
01:21:15,658 --> 01:21:20,879
latter half of this set but

1968
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:24,658
um what you're saying Leighton is is

1969
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:27,300
spelled out very specifically uh they're

1970
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:29,698
talking about having an increase in soil

1971
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,140
biology especially with fungal heavy

1972
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:33,439
compost

1973
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:37,380
um creating all of these soil

1974
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:41,759
opportunities that are not available to

1975
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:44,219
the soil when not using biologically and

1976
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,980
fungally active

1977
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:49,500
um agricultural soils so so anyway

1978
01:21:46,979 --> 01:21:51,839
that's that's the paper and so we'll get

1979
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:53,520
back on topic here so

1980
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:57,239
um so we're talking about the difference

1981
01:21:53,520 --> 01:22:02,940
between the soil science and the soil

1982
01:21:57,238 --> 01:22:05,759
biology and and how most of uh most of

1983
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:08,039
compost and and everything is looking at

1984
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,739
the at the chemistry and the physicality

1985
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:12,960
of the soil and not the biology

1986
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:15,359
um I would like you to speak to this

1987
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,319
idea of the the

1988
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:19,859
um

1989
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:24,119
the the the variety of biology right

1990
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:27,059
because NPK is so reductionist and and

1991
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:30,059
and most of us in cannabis were were

1992
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:32,880
brought up thinking you know hit our NPK

1993
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:34,860
numbers feed the plant or you know if we

1994
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:38,039
came from the bottle Forest feed the

1995
01:22:34,859 --> 01:22:41,539
plant and and and and what we are trying

1996
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:45,060
to tease out is that um you know the

1997
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:48,960
compost which is is is the central the

1998
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:52,500
focus of our topic we want it to be as

1999
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,679
biologically active as possible and and

2000
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:59,279
the way for us to do that is to not cook

2001
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:03,300
it like a thermal compost so I would

2002
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:06,420
like you to speak to what that uh

2003
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:08,880
process is like to produce a compost

2004
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:12,420
that has not been cooked because

2005
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:14,719
creating a cooked thermal compost is the

2006
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:17,460
only thing that I've ever heard of

2007
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:19,198
so again let's not call it compost let's

2008
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:21,359
call it organic matter fair enough right

2009
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:25,859
and organic matter is

2010
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:29,039
probably the largest uh source of

2011
01:23:25,859 --> 01:23:33,000
nutritional holding capacity all right

2012
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:35,460
this is where biology meets chemistry so

2013
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,039
most people understand what a cation

2014
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:41,579
exchange site is or cation exchange

2015
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:46,500
capacity so that capacity is the ability

2016
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:49,439
for nutrient solution to be held on the

2017
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:52,679
bond site so that it's not mobile and

2018
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:55,619
therefore safe and secure for later

2019
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:57,300
Harvest by the plant and the biology all

2020
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:58,920
right so that's that's really important

2021
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,520
to understand

2022
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,679
um

2023
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,080
so that being said

2024
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,420
uh trying to reel it back into

2025
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:09,719
understanding

2026
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:12,420
the thermophilic process of breaking

2027
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:14,760
down organic matter

2028
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:17,520
um I think that

2029
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,440
um the best the best way to approach it

2030
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:23,460
is is to

2031
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:27,299
understand that when you get over 120

2032
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:30,840
degrees you are losing biological

2033
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:33,420
diversity when you hit 130 degrees you

2034
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,640
have lost pretty much everything it's

2035
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:39,420
now just thermal fights that are living

2036
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:42,960
in that organic matter or on that

2037
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:49,199
organic matter I should say so

2038
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:52,140
that's why if your goal is to achieve a

2039
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:55,079
biological compost you have to be below

2040
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:56,520
120 degrees now

2041
01:24:55,079 --> 01:24:58,260
back in the day when I was studying

2042
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,820
under Lane there was always this issue

2043
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:02,820
of well you know you can bring in

2044
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:05,899
pathogens and you can cause you know

2045
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:08,698
plant problems uh you know

2046
01:25:05,899 --> 01:25:10,738
deficiencies and and all of these other

2047
01:25:08,698 --> 01:25:13,139
things because you've brought something

2048
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:17,639
in from somewhere else and you've

2049
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:21,000
applied it uh perhaps inappropriately

2050
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:22,860
um onto into this pod or onto this plant

2051
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,238
and

2052
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:30,359
my argument's always been that um

2053
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:30,979
diversity will out compete

2054
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:34,859
um

2055
01:25:30,979 --> 01:25:36,718
reductionist so if I've reduced this

2056
01:25:34,859 --> 01:25:39,719
down to just thermal fights the

2057
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,899
potential for a pathogenic outbreak is

2058
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:45,859
way greater than if I had a very

2059
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:49,920
biologically diverse compost system

2060
01:25:45,859 --> 01:25:52,139
this was one of of many conversations

2061
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:56,600
that Elaine and I agreed to disagree

2062
01:25:52,140 --> 01:26:00,300
about was the fact that for her

2063
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:03,300
she has a an incredible reputation a

2064
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:05,039
celebrity status so she has to be very

2065
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:08,880
guarded about what she says because

2066
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:12,658
people will inappropriately be morons

2067
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:14,699
and and use more uh because a little is

2068
01:26:12,658 --> 01:26:16,319
good oh more is better well that's how

2069
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:17,658
you get into these problems with

2070
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:19,340
pathogen

2071
01:26:17,658 --> 01:26:22,279
cross-contamination

2072
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:25,440
with deficient nutrient deficient issues

2073
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:27,599
because what happens is you you've

2074
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:29,638
created a newt lock or you've created a

2075
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,159
pathogenic inoculation

2076
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:35,520
so that's why it's critical that

2077
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:37,138
that she maintains that the only way to

2078
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,540
make safe compost is to do it

2079
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:42,300
thermophilically and I agree with her

2080
01:26:39,539 --> 01:26:44,939
because humans are just humans they they

2081
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:48,119
tend to do stuff without really thinking

2082
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:51,359
first and and you know making sure that

2083
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:54,059
they are crossing the t's and dotting

2084
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:55,799
the eyes responsibly

2085
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:57,659
um it tends to be oh whatever's easy and

2086
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:00,360
quickest for me is what I'm going to do

2087
01:26:57,658 --> 01:27:03,198
and that's not the appropriate approach

2088
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:08,099
when you're dealing with these critical

2089
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:09,479
types of uh biological exposures

2090
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:12,840
um there's there's some composts that

2091
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:14,579
I've made that are are definitely uh

2092
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,440
potentially very dangerous to play with

2093
01:27:14,579 --> 01:27:18,079
because if I have underlying health

2094
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:20,460
issues and I'm playing with

2095
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:22,920
pseudomonobacteria the potential for me

2096
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:24,960
to actually make myself very sick is is

2097
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:27,480
is real

2098
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,039
um I think that in many ways I've I've

2099
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:33,299
benefited

2100
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:34,619
from my work playing with anaerobic fish

2101
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:37,020
manure

2102
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:38,579
um because I early on was getting

2103
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:41,159
exposed to this stuff and like you said

2104
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:42,859
earlier if you get that stuff on you

2105
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:45,960
it's days

2106
01:27:42,859 --> 01:27:48,779
before you don't stink anymore so

2107
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,760
there's there's you know some serious

2108
01:27:48,779 --> 01:27:51,840
issues to it and but I learned very

2109
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:54,239
quickly

2110
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,639
um I never got violently sick I

2111
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:58,439
definitely uh you know had some stomach

2112
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:59,699
issues you know early on when I was

2113
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,799
playing with the stuff because I didn't

2114
01:27:59,698 --> 01:28:03,059
completely understand

2115
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:07,940
um about the difference between

2116
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:11,340
anaerobic digestion and and aerobic

2117
01:28:07,939 --> 01:28:13,799
aerobic microbes versus anaerobic

2118
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:16,500
microbes and and the potential for uh

2119
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:18,600
them to make us very sick so

2120
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:21,500
that being said

2121
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:24,780
um let's let's delve into

2122
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:26,460
what is a cold compost versus a

2123
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:27,119
thermophilic

2124
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:30,000
um

2125
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:31,920
in the cold composting situation

2126
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,219
um The Sweet Spot

2127
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,600
for massive

2128
01:28:34,219 --> 01:28:39,480
protozoa production and the reason I'm

2129
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:42,539
using protozoa is because they're the

2130
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:45,000
ones that are doing all of or the vast

2131
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:46,979
majority of nutrient cycling in other

2132
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,139
words the nutrient cycling is that this

2133
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:51,479
bacteria has all this good stuff locked

2134
01:28:49,139 --> 01:28:53,340
up in it including nitrogen and this

2135
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:55,319
protozoa wants to eat that bacteria

2136
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:57,539
because it wants the carbon to make

2137
01:28:55,319 --> 01:28:59,158
itself grow and get bigger does it want

2138
01:28:57,539 --> 01:29:02,100
the nitrogen doesn't care about what's

2139
01:28:59,158 --> 01:29:04,198
in the pantry of that bacteria so it

2140
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,060
consumes that and it poops out pure

2141
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:09,000
nitrogen and all of these other elements

2142
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:10,739
in a plant available form and that's

2143
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,738
critical

2144
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:16,379
um in pretty much all soil systems that

2145
01:29:13,738 --> 01:29:18,539
I look at the number one issue is the

2146
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:20,400
lack of protozoa that would be the

2147
01:29:18,539 --> 01:29:22,679
flagellates and amoeba those are the

2148
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:24,420
aerobic ones the anaerobic ones are the

2149
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:25,679
ciliates and then you get some faculties

2150
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:27,539
which we're not going to get into that

2151
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,399
it's just

2152
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:32,100
it's just the bottom line is The Sweet

2153
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:36,119
Spot is 85 degrees

2154
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:38,460
and 70 percent uh moisture content so

2155
01:29:36,119 --> 01:29:40,679
when you squeeze the stuff you will get

2156
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,520
water drops forming in between your

2157
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:44,579
fingers

2158
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:46,560
that tells you that it's above 50 if you

2159
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:49,380
get no moisture you're about 50 percent

2160
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:52,320
you get drops now you're pushing into

2161
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:54,900
the 60s 70s and 80 moisture

2162
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:56,819
that's the sweet spot for for protozoan

2163
01:29:54,899 --> 01:30:00,238
production

2164
01:29:56,819 --> 01:30:03,119
um it is also generally uh a sweet spot

2165
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:04,459
for what I want to call

2166
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:08,460
fungal

2167
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:10,020
sporulation and germination

2168
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:13,739
um

2169
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:16,800
in the soil system itself

2170
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:18,299
um plants don't like it uh that humid or

2171
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,400
that that much higher moisture that's

2172
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:23,520
when you get into root rots and you get

2173
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:27,779
into other disease-causing uh potential

2174
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:29,820
pathogens whereas in a compost pile it's

2175
01:30:27,779 --> 01:30:32,340
a different animal now we're not dealing

2176
01:30:29,819 --> 01:30:34,319
with plant life yet we're just dealing

2177
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:37,260
with protozoa and production

2178
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:39,539
and when I'm applying

2179
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:42,600
um this well I probably need to go

2180
01:30:39,539 --> 01:30:45,119
through the process of of how I do it so

2181
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:47,699
I'm I'm taking these vegan

2182
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:50,340
um compost so it's just plants no

2183
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:54,299
manures greens and Browns the ratio is

2184
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:57,060
is always 66 percent Browns 3 uh three

2185
01:30:54,300 --> 01:31:00,000
and a half percent greens

2186
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:05,039
um and you are using a tremendous amount

2187
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,920
of water to to get that to begin what I

2188
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:10,079
call the thermophilic rise we never want

2189
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:13,079
to get to the thermophil process that's

2190
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:15,119
130. we've got to keep it below 120. I

2191
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:17,698
generally tell people keep it below 115.

2192
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:19,260
if I get to 115 I gotta flip it as a

2193
01:31:17,698 --> 01:31:21,559
matter of fact I got to flip a pile this

2194
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:24,300
afternoon because I'm at 115 right now

2195
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:27,120
that being said

2196
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:30,480
let the temperature go up to a certain

2197
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:32,880
point 115 is Max and then I flip it if

2198
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:34,198
it doesn't get to 115 then I never flip

2199
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,819
it

2200
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:37,879
um I just let it do its thing and I

2201
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:40,799
watch it until it starts to come down

2202
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:43,260
not quite to ambient Ambient would be

2203
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:46,980
the the temperature outside environment

2204
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:49,739
so today it's 75 as always and sunny so

2205
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:53,759
when it's 75 degrees and I know it's

2206
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:56,698
gone through the biological process or

2207
01:31:53,760 --> 01:32:00,000
the thermophilic rise that never got to

2208
01:31:56,698 --> 01:32:02,219
thermophilic phase so I brought it up

2209
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,020
but I kept it in the mesophilic now

2210
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:06,480
that's considered immature compost

2211
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:09,060
because it's not really well broken down

2212
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:10,799
so how do I break it down at that point

2213
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:13,260
well that's where I get into these

2214
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:19,079
mechanical forces I use agitation

2215
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:22,380
aeration vibration uh spin so gravity

2216
01:32:19,079 --> 01:32:24,600
all of these things to to get that

2217
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:25,920
immature compost

2218
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,380
to

2219
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,920
harvest the the things that I'm looking

2220
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:34,920
for which is the biology and and the

2221
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:37,020
smallest bits poem particulate organic

2222
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:38,880
matter that I can get through that

2223
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:41,239
process and then whatever's left goes

2224
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,819
right back into the compost pile again

2225
01:32:41,238 --> 01:32:48,059
are you describing

2226
01:32:43,819 --> 01:32:51,238
mechanical processes that you

2227
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:54,539
um uh submit the

2228
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:56,099
immature the immature organic material

2229
01:32:54,539 --> 01:33:00,539
to

2230
01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:04,260
um that replaces what is normally done

2231
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:06,539
by breaking down with thermals or time

2232
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:10,100
or because again right you can you can

2233
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:13,738
stack up a pile of ships uh or or any

2234
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:16,920
organic matter for that map matter any

2235
01:33:13,738 --> 01:33:20,119
organic matter for that matter

2236
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:23,279
um and it will go through a decom

2237
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:25,019
decomposition phase whether it gets hot

2238
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:26,939
whether it goes thermophilic or not it

2239
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:28,620
doesn't matter I mean I don't know about

2240
01:33:26,939 --> 01:33:31,019
you but growing up in New England we had

2241
01:33:28,619 --> 01:33:32,698
to rake leaves every fall and we would

2242
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:34,679
take those leaves and dump them over at

2243
01:33:32,698 --> 01:33:37,019
the edge of the swamp and that pile

2244
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:38,639
would be like five feet tall me and my

2245
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:40,800
sisters would jump in it we'd have a

2246
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:43,079
blast throwing these and you know

2247
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,480
running down the hill and fast as we can

2248
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:48,238
trying to dive into the pile but come

2249
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:51,059
spring that pile was gone it was just

2250
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:53,638
this low lump of

2251
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:56,039
what was left of we call it leaf mold

2252
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:57,239
nowadays but just what was left of all

2253
01:33:56,039 --> 01:33:59,639
those leaves

2254
01:33:57,238 --> 01:34:01,919
so that went through a breakdown process

2255
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:04,980
but it never got hot it never we never

2256
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,380
saw those piles steaming so there was no

2257
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:09,419
major heat exchange but there was

2258
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:11,880
definitely some minor heat exchange in

2259
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:15,840
order for that to break down

2260
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:18,179
when you add the water the um the the 85

2261
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,520
degrees and 70 percent moisture that's a

2262
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:24,420
that's a lot of moisture

2263
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:27,000
um uh is the water involved because it's

2264
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:28,500
there to keep the temperature from

2265
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,079
spiking I think you called it a

2266
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:32,819
thermophilic rise I'm not very familiar

2267
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:35,639
with that I'd like to know what happens

2268
01:34:32,819 --> 01:34:38,039
during the thermophilic rise and what's

2269
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:39,000
what what's happened like why why so

2270
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,880
much water

2271
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,219
so the water

2272
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:46,319
is broken into

2273
01:34:43,219 --> 01:34:50,039
H2O all right so we have oxygen and we

2274
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:53,039
have hydrogen there are a lot of uh

2275
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:57,238
arterial constituents that that thrive

2276
01:34:53,039 --> 01:35:00,840
on hydrogen so they consume hydrogen as

2277
01:34:57,238 --> 01:35:03,299
a fuel source to break apart the

2278
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:05,940
nitrogen in the organ organic matter or

2279
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:08,279
the carbon off of the organic matter

2280
01:35:05,939 --> 01:35:11,279
all right so

2281
01:35:08,279 --> 01:35:13,619
there are also other forms of bacteria

2282
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:15,719
that consume the oxygen

2283
01:35:13,619 --> 01:35:17,880
to do their part in Breaking the

2284
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:20,100
nitrogen and the carbon off of each

2285
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:23,159
other does that make sense yeah it does

2286
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:25,280
so water's the food water's life right

2287
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:29,779
there's no joke to that water is life

2288
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:32,698
without it and nothing ceases to exist

2289
01:35:29,779 --> 01:35:34,279
so that water is just a fuel source it

2290
01:35:32,698 --> 01:35:36,419
has nothing to do with with with

2291
01:35:34,279 --> 01:35:38,099
regulating temperatures not we're not

2292
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:40,619
putting out the fire we're just

2293
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:42,420
providing a food source for the biology

2294
01:35:40,619 --> 01:35:44,158
to do their part in Breaking the

2295
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:46,859
nitrogen and the carbon off of each

2296
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:49,619
other and so

2297
01:35:46,859 --> 01:35:52,259
um uh let's see I'm gonna try to do a

2298
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:55,319
summarization to this point so so what

2299
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:57,300
we're trying to do with the cold compost

2300
01:35:55,319 --> 01:36:01,920
is that

2301
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:04,440
um we are going to a use only plant

2302
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:07,800
matter so we don't have to worry as much

2303
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:09,899
about pathogens like E coli and then

2304
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:13,739
we're not going to let the temperature

2305
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:16,920
go above 85 degrees but especially 120

2306
01:36:13,738 --> 01:36:20,579
but 85 is really our our goal

2307
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:23,760
um so that the the the pile

2308
01:36:20,579 --> 01:36:27,179
um gets warm naturally from the breaking

2309
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:30,119
down but it doesn't get hot enough to

2310
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:31,619
kill our microbes off and we can get

2311
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:34,500
away with that because we're only using

2312
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:37,279
plant material instead of animal

2313
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:44,420
material which can cause the pathogens

2314
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:48,840
and and then we are also going to do uh

2315
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:52,760
mechanical processes to this organic

2316
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:55,940
material that will further break it down

2317
01:36:52,760 --> 01:37:00,020
to create more of these biological

2318
01:36:55,939 --> 01:37:04,439
opportunities in the soil for life

2319
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:07,199
which also breaks down the compost in

2320
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:10,259
ways some of the some of the ways that

2321
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:14,279
we would get from a thermal version as

2322
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:18,719
well so we're we're choosing to not use

2323
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:24,840
the heat of a thermophilic compost and

2324
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:28,859
instead we are using a safer inputs and

2325
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:31,860
also massaging the soil in ways that

2326
01:37:28,859 --> 01:37:34,859
opens up opportunities and so we have

2327
01:37:31,859 --> 01:37:36,719
what is essentially yes a riskier or I

2328
01:37:34,859 --> 01:37:38,000
love what you said earlier a dangerous

2329
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:41,460
compost

2330
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:45,600
but we have decreased that risk by not

2331
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:48,600
using animal products in there and we

2332
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:50,880
are making it more diverse and more

2333
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:53,940
effective by doing some of these

2334
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:56,340
mechanical preparations too

2335
01:37:53,939 --> 01:37:58,859
yes and I think the other thing is that

2336
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:01,440
you missed is seats right when I when I

2337
01:37:58,859 --> 01:38:03,599
harvest greens and Browns and I harvest

2338
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:04,919
greens and Browns

2339
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,079
um I don't

2340
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:09,179
Harvest plants that have gone to seed

2341
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:12,179
because I don't want the seed in my

2342
01:38:09,179 --> 01:38:14,158
compost what I want is flowers but I

2343
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:15,840
don't want the seed pods so that's

2344
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:18,000
another piece of this that's important

2345
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:22,020
and the other one which is we're missing

2346
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,479
on is diversity like I I collect like

2347
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:26,820
every type of green I can find every

2348
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:28,939
type of brown I can find

2349
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:32,819
um and then I use those proportionally

2350
01:38:28,939 --> 01:38:37,138
uh volume not by weight

2351
01:38:32,819 --> 01:38:40,139
to make my pile and the reason it's so

2352
01:38:37,139 --> 01:38:44,359
important to get the diversity is

2353
01:38:40,139 --> 01:38:44,359
because of endophytic biology

2354
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,659
it's a little bit deep but we gotta go

2355
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,819
there all right so the end of fights

2356
01:38:48,658 --> 01:38:53,939
that live inside those green leaves and

2357
01:38:50,819 --> 01:38:56,759
luckily we just did the Jeff lowenfels

2358
01:38:53,939 --> 01:38:58,559
show on uh bacterial endophyte so

2359
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,719
anybody who just listened to that show

2360
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,460
is already going to be up to speed on

2361
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,500
this so so folks who want to hear more

2362
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:06,300
about this go back and listen to the

2363
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:08,520
show about the new Jeff lowenfell's book

2364
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:10,980
with that please continue

2365
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,860
all right so but there's both endophytic

2366
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:17,158
bacteria and there's endophytic fungi

2367
01:39:13,859 --> 01:39:19,619
that live inside the plant itself so

2368
01:39:17,158 --> 01:39:22,920
when that leaf

2369
01:39:19,619 --> 01:39:25,079
um is fall comes and it dries out and

2370
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:27,359
falls to the ground if it lands on the

2371
01:39:25,079 --> 01:39:29,880
ground it's going to release

2372
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:33,119
um sap robes uh this is a type of fungi

2373
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:35,159
that decomposes organic matter but it's

2374
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:36,719
also going to release decomposing

2375
01:39:35,158 --> 01:39:38,939
bacteria

2376
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:41,779
um say it lands in the water

2377
01:39:38,939 --> 01:39:43,738
well it's now going to become aquatic

2378
01:39:41,779 --> 01:39:46,979
microorganisms now you've heard me talk

2379
01:39:43,738 --> 01:39:49,859
about the great mass migrations uh

2380
01:39:46,979 --> 01:39:52,379
before the great human expansions and

2381
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:55,500
this here again is a subject that is uh

2382
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:58,800
somewhat debating or debatable that that

2383
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:01,319
there is microbes that live can live

2384
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,760
both terrestrial and Aquatic I'm a firm

2385
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:04,439
believer of it but there's plenty of

2386
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,780
people out there that would say I'm I'm

2387
01:40:04,439 --> 01:40:09,960
batshit crazy on this but

2388
01:40:06,779 --> 01:40:12,000
that being said I have proven it uh to

2389
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,380
myself many many times in the products

2390
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,960
that I've done

2391
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:19,079
um one of the key things that I focus on

2392
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:21,719
is diatoms those are

2393
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:25,500
specific organism that lives generally

2394
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:30,000
speaking in aquatic environments and it

2395
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:32,460
produces or they produce oxygen via two

2396
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,920
different sources that's why they're so

2397
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:37,880
powerful one is through photosynthesis

2398
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:40,380
and the other is through

2399
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:43,500
consuming biology consuming bacteria

2400
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:46,340
consuming nutrients that are are in the

2401
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:47,899
water system and then using their own

2402
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:51,000
internal

2403
01:40:47,899 --> 01:40:54,000
biological factories to take that

2404
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:57,119
nutrient out of the water and build

2405
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,279
their shells and build build their uh or

2406
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:02,340
I should say divide and continue to

2407
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:04,099
expand as a population so I've applied

2408
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:07,260
I've applied

2409
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:08,039
diatom based

2410
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:09,780
um

2411
01:41:08,039 --> 01:41:12,238
well it's one of my ingredients it's

2412
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:15,059
called fish Brew for lack of better ways

2413
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:18,959
just let's get right after it so fish

2414
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:20,880
Brew uh the the farm on Cape Cod has

2415
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:23,520
fresh water diatoms like I've never seen

2416
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:26,760
before and I got so excited when I found

2417
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:29,820
this stuff because diatoms are a great

2418
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:32,340
indicator like you I can apply uh

2419
01:41:29,819 --> 01:41:34,139
diatoms to your soil and I can come back

2420
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:36,020
next year the year after the year after

2421
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:38,219
year after and I'll be able to find them

2422
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:40,500
if they're healthy they will have a

2423
01:41:38,219 --> 01:41:42,260
chloroplast and I can see the their

2424
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:45,719
nucleus and their other you know

2425
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:47,400
oreganellos if they're not healthy if

2426
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:50,219
they're dead they're just an empty shell

2427
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:52,979
made of silica and silica has a tendency

2428
01:41:50,219 --> 01:41:55,500
to last uh quite a while in the soil so

2429
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:57,658
there's a great indication that I can

2430
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,219
take aquatic organisms and put them in a

2431
01:41:57,658 --> 01:42:01,079
terrestrial environment and they will

2432
01:41:59,219 --> 01:42:03,658
survive

2433
01:42:01,079 --> 01:42:07,079
um so that being said

2434
01:42:03,658 --> 01:42:09,799
when I take my

2435
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:12,000
um low temp compost

2436
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:15,300
and I

2437
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:18,539
throw it into a situation where I'm

2438
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:23,579
using agitation centrifugal force

2439
01:42:18,539 --> 01:42:27,238
aeration soft collision and I'm breaking

2440
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:29,779
off all of these pieces of of what I

2441
01:42:27,238 --> 01:42:29,779
want to call

2442
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:35,460
pre-digested organic matter so it's in

2443
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:39,299
the digestion process but it hasn't been

2444
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:43,198
completely digested into like a palm or

2445
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:45,060
a mom if there's still very much a lot

2446
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:48,599
of organic matter that has not gone

2447
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:51,420
through any kind of decomposition so now

2448
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:53,159
I've I've taken that I've I've banged it

2449
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:56,699
against each other I've pulled off all

2450
01:42:53,158 --> 01:42:59,339
of the little bits that have decomposed

2451
01:42:56,698 --> 01:43:01,919
um and I've I've done this in an aqueous

2452
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:03,420
environment with fish brew and and some

2453
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,300
worm castings

2454
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:08,219
so now all of a sudden I have all of

2455
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:10,380
this suspended stuff

2456
01:43:08,219 --> 01:43:13,439
uh in the water column it looks like

2457
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:15,359
chocolate water so it's very very uh

2458
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:18,719
rich with humic acids which we've talked

2459
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:21,000
about as as the biological SuperFood

2460
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:25,139
I've introduced all these microbes from

2461
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:27,779
from fish Brew which is like incredible

2462
01:43:25,139 --> 01:43:30,118
if you look at the the DNA sequences of

2463
01:43:27,779 --> 01:43:32,939
what they've done it's called Meadow

2464
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:34,859
meta barcoding where you're getting a

2465
01:43:32,939 --> 01:43:36,839
general idea of who's present or who's

2466
01:43:34,859 --> 01:43:38,939
been there

2467
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,679
um which gets deeper into horizontal

2468
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:44,339
Gene transfer which we can't go there

2469
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:46,260
today but that being said is now I have

2470
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:49,619
all of this diversity I have all the

2471
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:52,560
endophytes from from the decomposed

2472
01:43:49,618 --> 01:43:55,618
organic matter I all of these uh

2473
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,260
biological constituents that came in on

2474
01:43:55,618 --> 01:44:00,839
the fish brew and then I have all of

2475
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:05,460
these secondary and tertiary metabolites

2476
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:07,020
from the digestion of the worms that is

2477
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:10,020
called worm castings

2478
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:11,639
so this in many ways you know when I

2479
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:15,060
started this journey I had no idea what

2480
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:17,520
the [ __ ] I was doing but now 14 15 years

2481
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:20,039
later I'm really seeing like that was

2482
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:23,100
like uh what do you call intuition

2483
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:24,479
Instinct drove me down that path of well

2484
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:26,219
everyone talks about how great worm

2485
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:28,919
castings are I should add some of those

2486
01:44:26,219 --> 01:44:30,658
oh and I know how good fish manure is

2487
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,000
because every time I play with it and I

2488
01:44:30,658 --> 01:44:35,399
appropriately aerobically stabilize it

2489
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,679
and I poured on Plants man of those

2490
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:40,738
plants explode and I also know the value

2491
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:43,020
of compost and and the fact that it

2492
01:44:40,738 --> 01:44:45,299
brings in these these superfoods like

2493
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:48,179
humic and fulvic acids as well as all

2494
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:49,739
these secondary and tertiary metabolites

2495
01:44:48,179 --> 01:44:51,600
that that are happening during the

2496
01:44:49,738 --> 01:44:54,658
decomposition phase

2497
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,400
so bam there's a there's a grand slam

2498
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:57,719
Home Run For You by adding all these

2499
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:00,899
things together

2500
01:44:57,719 --> 01:45:04,859
using mechanical forces to separate them

2501
01:45:00,899 --> 01:45:07,099
and then using uh what I call dewatering

2502
01:45:04,859 --> 01:45:10,439
Technique which is through vibration

2503
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:12,500
vibrating the organic matter to shed all

2504
01:45:10,439 --> 01:45:18,019
of the liquid off of it

2505
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:20,340
now I have a biological super

2506
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:23,400
Secret Sauce whatever you want to call

2507
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:27,960
it now if I want to make that shelf

2508
01:45:23,399 --> 01:45:30,479
stable then I have to press it so take

2509
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:32,579
the dewatering to another level

2510
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:35,698
and then I take that and fluff it up and

2511
01:45:32,579 --> 01:45:39,059
that's what you got was was that

2512
01:45:35,698 --> 01:45:40,738
po inoculated poem that's easy to work

2513
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:43,199
with just put it in a glass of water

2514
01:45:40,738 --> 01:45:45,238
Stir It Up as a matter of fact on the

2515
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:47,460
podcast couple weeks back I actually

2516
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:49,198
drank some I put some 11 year old

2517
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:51,000
product in a glass of water stirred it

2518
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:52,919
up and drank it on camera because I've

2519
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,300
been telling people that I eat this [ __ ]

2520
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:56,460
all the time every time I work with it I

2521
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:58,380
get in my mouth my ears it's always my

2522
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:00,118
fingernails are always dirty so I'm just

2523
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:03,179
constantly being inoculated with this

2524
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:05,158
stuff so I proved that hey it's not

2525
01:46:03,179 --> 01:46:07,800
going to hurt you it's actually really

2526
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:09,420
super beneficial to your your entire

2527
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,159
digestive tract

2528
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:13,020
because you're putting in microbes that

2529
01:46:11,158 --> 01:46:14,759
aren't there or weren't there or haven't

2530
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:17,280
been there for a long time that are

2531
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:20,219
doing again all these crazy biogeo

2532
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:23,519
chemical reactions that we have only

2533
01:46:20,219 --> 01:46:26,219
begun to discuss because science is

2534
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,139
moving into an interdisciplinary mode

2535
01:46:26,219 --> 01:46:30,118
because the reductionist side of it has

2536
01:46:28,139 --> 01:46:31,679
realized we can't just keep reducing

2537
01:46:30,118 --> 01:46:33,420
everything down to nothing and then not

2538
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:34,859
talk to anybody about how does this

2539
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:37,859
affect their work or how does this

2540
01:46:34,859 --> 01:46:39,899
affect that processor so it's an

2541
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:42,118
interesting time to be alive as these

2542
01:46:39,899 --> 01:46:45,179
things are happening but we don't have

2543
01:46:42,118 --> 01:46:47,759
the technology yet to really delve down

2544
01:46:45,179 --> 01:46:49,859
what those processes are and why they're

2545
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,480
so important and how they are affecting

2546
01:46:49,859 --> 01:46:54,000
everything around them

2547
01:46:51,479 --> 01:46:55,939
so again if if you don't have the

2548
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,560
technology but you have the know-how

2549
01:46:55,939 --> 01:47:00,960
well then that's the key to the whole

2550
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,000
thing is all right I don't know why it

2551
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,679
works but I know it does work so I'm

2552
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,039
going to keep doing it

2553
01:47:04,679 --> 01:47:10,199
and that's go ahead okay so so

2554
01:47:08,039 --> 01:47:13,920
um you know bringing this home a little

2555
01:47:10,198 --> 01:47:15,479
bit to uh like how it can be used by the

2556
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:20,579
cultivator

2557
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:24,118
um we it sounds like this cold compost

2558
01:47:20,579 --> 01:47:27,899
inoculant does all of the things that we

2559
01:47:24,118 --> 01:47:30,960
think a thermal compost will do uh the

2560
01:47:27,899 --> 01:47:33,299
you know we we we we use a thermal

2561
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:36,000
compost as an amendment we use a thermal

2562
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:38,579
compost as a as a top dress we use a

2563
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,579
thermal compost to make compost tea why

2564
01:47:38,579 --> 01:47:45,059
do we do that because we want to add

2565
01:47:41,579 --> 01:47:47,519
um you know life Vibrance uh to our

2566
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:50,580
plants but we know because they've been

2567
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:53,460
cooked so hot because you know that's a

2568
01:47:50,579 --> 01:47:56,219
smart thing to do when there's pathogens

2569
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:58,980
um that that it's it's actually not as

2570
01:47:56,219 --> 01:48:02,639
vibrant with life as as we would hope it

2571
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:07,079
would be in our Gardens and so what

2572
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:09,359
we've done with this is we have used a

2573
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:13,198
lower temperature and we have gathered

2574
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:16,019
our microbes and and protozoa and other

2575
01:48:13,198 --> 01:48:18,719
biology we have we've gone through the

2576
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:21,780
effort to bring them together from these

2577
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:24,840
three different directions and and we

2578
01:48:21,779 --> 01:48:27,420
are actually creating a air quotes

2579
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:31,260
compost which is essentially organic

2580
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:34,500
matter that is actually what we think of

2581
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:37,500
when we think of compost but the common

2582
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:42,238
form of compost that we get which is

2583
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:45,539
thermal actually is not supercharged the

2584
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:48,718
way we really want it to be and so this

2585
01:48:45,539 --> 01:48:52,560
cold organic matter because of the Care

2586
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:55,198
we've put into it is actually what we

2587
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:57,719
idealize about compost

2588
01:48:55,198 --> 01:48:59,879
yeah biomimicry right we talk about

2589
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:01,260
biomimicry all the time I've had

2590
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:03,420
arguments with people that say there's

2591
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:05,579
no such thing as as compost in nature

2592
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:08,100
and I'm like no you're wrong look at

2593
01:49:05,579 --> 01:49:10,439
every time there's a flood

2594
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:12,480
that's all piled up all the sticks and

2595
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:15,178
brush and algae from the bottom of the

2596
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:18,118
river is piled up and that's float Sam

2597
01:49:15,179 --> 01:49:22,079
that's a compost pile underneath the

2598
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:25,259
forest that's a compost pile that's just

2599
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:28,079
a giant compost pile dead animals dead

2600
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:30,179
sticks leaves you know plants that have

2601
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:32,880
come in and gone out

2602
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:34,560
um they're all creating compost now that

2603
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,500
compost doesn't heat up in the forest

2604
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:39,300
floor nor does it the float sand the

2605
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:40,500
pile that's you know left by the side of

2606
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:42,420
the river

2607
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,279
those don't heat up those are those

2608
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:46,679
would be considered cold compost do they

2609
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:48,300
heat up to some degree well I'm sure in

2610
01:49:46,679 --> 01:49:50,579
in the pockets of it when it's really

2611
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:51,960
dense and compressed that's going to

2612
01:49:50,579 --> 01:49:54,899
heat up but is it going to go

2613
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:56,760
thermophilic no it's not it's not gonna

2614
01:49:54,899 --> 01:49:59,879
it's not gonna ever get to a position

2615
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:02,639
where it could combust and that is the

2616
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:06,118
end of the thermophilic phase if you let

2617
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:08,760
it run wild is combustion is when the

2618
01:50:06,118 --> 01:50:10,439
microbes start to produce alcohol and

2619
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,760
then and then it can you know

2620
01:50:10,439 --> 01:50:15,178
self-combust

2621
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:19,280
so you know again thermophytes are are

2622
01:50:15,179 --> 01:50:19,279
important to understand and and

2623
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:22,979
getting your head wrapped around the

2624
01:50:21,238 --> 01:50:24,899
fact that you do not want to

2625
01:50:22,979 --> 01:50:26,759
cross-contaminate you do not want to

2626
01:50:24,899 --> 01:50:29,879
deal with pathogens you do not want to

2627
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:32,639
deal with seeds thermophilic process is

2628
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:33,779
a great way to bypass that potential

2629
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:36,900
problem

2630
01:50:33,779 --> 01:50:39,118
all right so um I want to go back to

2631
01:50:36,899 --> 01:50:41,698
talking about the the actual physical

2632
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:43,559
structure of good compost uh during the

2633
01:50:41,698 --> 01:50:45,059
third set we're gonna we're gonna talk a

2634
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:47,159
little bit more about your actual

2635
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:50,280
manufacturing techniques all these ways

2636
01:50:47,158 --> 01:50:52,379
that you massage it but um you

2637
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:53,939
um you know you made a special point to

2638
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:57,840
talk about

2639
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:59,698
um you're breaking the pieces down to a

2640
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:01,139
small size using these other methods

2641
01:50:59,698 --> 01:51:03,839
that we're going to talk about but you

2642
01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:08,400
were very specific that the reason that

2643
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:12,659
you're doing it is to make these organic

2644
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:16,138
matter grains have lots of Housing and

2645
01:51:12,658 --> 01:51:18,599
Community opportunities for the microbes

2646
01:51:16,139 --> 01:51:22,199
and protozoa and amoeba and other

2647
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:24,060
denizens of the rhizosphere right so so

2648
01:51:22,198 --> 01:51:26,118
talk a little bit that about that would

2649
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:29,460
you about the the actual physical

2650
01:51:26,118 --> 01:51:33,118
structure of good compost

2651
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:35,639
so this goes back to poem particulate

2652
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:37,500
organic matter and moem mineral

2653
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:39,659
Associated organic matter mineral

2654
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:41,880
Associated organic matter is going to be

2655
01:51:39,658 --> 01:51:44,339
very dense kind of like

2656
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:47,340
um worm castings except for even more

2657
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:49,400
dense so think of bulk density how much

2658
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:52,819
something weighs by volume

2659
01:51:49,399 --> 01:51:54,839
and those weights are going to be

2660
01:51:52,819 --> 01:51:58,319
indicators of

2661
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:59,880
how long that material that organic

2662
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:01,139
matter is going to last in the soil

2663
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:05,159
system

2664
01:52:01,139 --> 01:52:06,659
as well as how quickly it will release

2665
01:52:05,158 --> 01:52:10,079
its nutrient

2666
01:52:06,658 --> 01:52:12,960
so poem will last two to three months in

2667
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:15,539
an organic system uh Moen

2668
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:19,618
will last two to three years so there's

2669
01:52:15,539 --> 01:52:21,539
a big difference what does last mean so

2670
01:52:19,618 --> 01:52:22,198
um you throw

2671
01:52:21,539 --> 01:52:25,618
um

2672
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:27,000
poem down on uh on an orchard in three

2673
01:52:25,618 --> 01:52:29,219
months it's going to be gone it's going

2674
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,079
to be decomposed by all of the biology

2675
01:52:29,219 --> 01:52:34,139
not the thermophytes but the other

2676
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:36,539
decomposers whether that's fungi or

2677
01:52:34,139 --> 01:52:40,380
bacteria but it's going to be it's gonna

2678
01:52:36,539 --> 01:52:42,420
go away it's going to have been used up

2679
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:45,239
as a nutrient

2680
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:48,000
for the plants that you've applied it to

2681
01:52:45,238 --> 01:52:50,459
does that make sense yep I do okay so

2682
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,920
again the the moment is going to last

2683
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:57,658
years and the poem is going to last

2684
01:52:52,920 --> 01:53:01,079
months so what that tells me is that if

2685
01:52:57,658 --> 01:53:01,079
I colonize.com

2686
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:05,579
and I apply it

2687
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:07,399
then what's going to happen is we're

2688
01:53:05,579 --> 01:53:09,779
going to have a fast nutrient release

2689
01:53:07,399 --> 01:53:11,158
within within three months it's all

2690
01:53:09,779 --> 01:53:13,979
going to be gone it's going to be

2691
01:53:11,158 --> 01:53:17,399
consumed and released plant available

2692
01:53:13,979 --> 01:53:19,559
or at least stored in the in uh biology

2693
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:21,359
in the bacteria

2694
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,860
um whereas moam

2695
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:24,179
um you're not going to get that fast

2696
01:53:22,859 --> 01:53:26,698
release you're going to get a really

2697
01:53:24,179 --> 01:53:28,260
really slow release which is good for

2698
01:53:26,698 --> 01:53:31,319
soil structure

2699
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:34,079
because you want you want concrete

2700
01:53:31,319 --> 01:53:38,158
foundations you don't want to build your

2701
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:43,100
your Palace on bamboo stilts right

2702
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:45,059
but if I'm trying to get uh

2703
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:47,520
inoculation

2704
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:50,039
I want to get those microbes that that

2705
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:53,639
have set up shop and and in these

2706
01:53:50,039 --> 01:53:57,118
condominiums on on this poem

2707
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:59,219
then the best way to do it is use the

2708
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:02,579
poem because I know it's going to have

2709
01:53:59,219 --> 01:54:05,939
released all of that biology into the

2710
01:54:02,579 --> 01:54:07,158
soil relatively quickly and to be honest

2711
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:11,158
with you

2712
01:54:07,158 --> 01:54:13,379
moam is so dense the bulk density is so

2713
01:54:11,158 --> 01:54:15,238
great that you again you don't have the

2714
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:18,840
ability for

2715
01:54:15,238 --> 01:54:21,299
um you know Mass colonization you

2716
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:24,480
it's too dense it doesn't let the oxygen

2717
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:26,880
in to feed the bacteria that in turn are

2718
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:29,819
are providing food sources for the

2719
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:32,579
protozoa and it gets complex but I I

2720
01:54:29,819 --> 01:54:36,420
think I explained it okay there yeah and

2721
01:54:32,579 --> 01:54:39,899
so um the the you want to have these

2722
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:42,960
these small fluffy

2723
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:45,299
um you know granular I I guess it's

2724
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:48,179
probably the outside of them are also we

2725
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:50,579
don't want anything like Smooth

2726
01:54:48,179 --> 01:54:53,279
um so it creates all these like small

2727
01:54:50,579 --> 01:54:55,800
micro hotels for all of these microbes

2728
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:58,019
that is essentially the point exactly

2729
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:01,079
dude like remember when we were smashing

2730
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:03,600
up rocks yeah oh God yeah I remember

2731
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:06,179
smashing up rocks to make my uh to make

2732
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:09,239
my regen tent with the with the soil

2733
01:55:06,179 --> 01:55:11,520
horizons oh my God yep so no smooth

2734
01:55:09,238 --> 01:55:13,559
surfaces yeah

2735
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,739
think of it like

2736
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:20,940
if you polish something it's very

2737
01:55:16,738 --> 01:55:22,979
difficult for oxidization for uh you

2738
01:55:20,939 --> 01:55:26,158
know any kind of mechanical

2739
01:55:22,979 --> 01:55:29,158
um Force to to break it down so that

2740
01:55:26,158 --> 01:55:32,039
polish is is protection and and yes you

2741
01:55:29,158 --> 01:55:33,899
you want porous you want surface area as

2742
01:55:32,039 --> 01:55:36,479
much as you possibly can get so things

2743
01:55:33,899 --> 01:55:39,238
can get into the cracks and set up shop

2744
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:41,519
and set up their biofilm and start to

2745
01:55:39,238 --> 01:55:43,279
expand out but they can't do that on a

2746
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:47,280
smooth surface

2747
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:49,738
they don't have the benefit of of the

2748
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:52,920
protection on three sides they're

2749
01:55:49,738 --> 01:55:55,379
they're basically Exposed on 180 degrees

2750
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:57,600
on a polished surface where if they're

2751
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:59,880
in a little crack or a crevice there's a

2752
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:01,619
very small exposure to to the outside

2753
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:03,840
environment all right that makes sense

2754
01:56:01,618 --> 01:56:04,979
especially with the word porous that

2755
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,739
that gives me the picture I'm looking

2756
01:56:04,979 --> 01:56:10,099
for so um so the last thing I want to

2757
01:56:07,738 --> 01:56:13,678
talk about here in set two

2758
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:16,380
is um uh what is essentially the point

2759
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:17,520
of the of the paper we for we referred

2760
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:21,359
to earlier

2761
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:24,060
which is talking about how you know in

2762
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:25,380
this cold compost that we are are

2763
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:28,980
creating

2764
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:31,079
we want to have there be a variety of

2765
01:56:28,979 --> 01:56:33,839
fungals there

2766
01:56:31,079 --> 01:56:35,760
um and so like of course there is you

2767
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:38,219
know you know basic funcles that that

2768
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:42,060
we're all familiar with like mycelium

2769
01:56:38,219 --> 01:56:45,000
but this paper goes into uh depth that

2770
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:48,539
there is a wide variety of different

2771
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:52,399
fungal participants that the more of

2772
01:56:48,539 --> 01:56:55,800
them we have the more a combination of

2773
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:58,019
fungals and bacterias and nutrients it

2774
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:01,560
it becomes this kind of wild mix and

2775
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:04,820
match where it like a buffet that that

2776
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:07,560
um like everybody can get what they need

2777
01:57:04,819 --> 01:57:11,099
but you know I've never really heard

2778
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:14,159
anybody talk too much about the variety

2779
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:16,079
of of fungals except for like oh do you

2780
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:17,339
want to make a you know bacteria

2781
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:19,439
dominant

2782
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:21,480
um compost tea or do you want to make a

2783
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:24,839
fungal dominant compost tea that's about

2784
01:57:21,479 --> 01:57:29,339
as far as I generally hear it so would

2785
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:34,139
you please address the the fungals in

2786
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:35,880
the cold compost their importance and

2787
01:57:34,139 --> 01:57:38,699
um you know as much as you can tell us

2788
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:41,340
like what they're doing there

2789
01:57:38,698 --> 01:57:43,079
okay so you hit on a couple of really

2790
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:45,599
important parts

2791
01:57:43,079 --> 01:57:49,260
um first one is IMO right everybody's

2792
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:52,920
like IMO IMO and Imo is the foundation

2793
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:55,500
of natural farming what is IMO well I'll

2794
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:59,340
be honest with you it's yeasts it's not

2795
01:57:55,500 --> 01:58:03,060
saprophytic fungi it's basically the

2796
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:06,179
precursor the the the successionary

2797
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:09,480
system that has to be in place in order

2798
01:58:06,179 --> 01:58:11,279
for sap robes to do their work to come

2799
01:58:09,479 --> 01:58:13,738
out to have an environment where they

2800
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:15,840
can survive so it goes back along the

2801
01:58:13,738 --> 01:58:18,359
same understanding principles of soil

2802
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:22,800
succession so you start with a very low

2803
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:26,279
F to B ratio swamp uh non-associated uh

2804
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:27,960
plants more bacterially dominant

2805
01:58:26,279 --> 01:58:29,880
and then you move all the way up into

2806
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:33,359
the conifers which are

2807
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:35,520
very funly dominant and and wide variety

2808
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:39,179
of different uh constituents that in

2809
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:42,060
play so in order to build that um

2810
01:58:39,179 --> 01:58:46,199
Foundation or that roadway so that you

2811
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:49,920
can bring in the groups of uh following

2812
01:58:46,198 --> 01:58:53,098
the successionary groups into play you

2813
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:57,840
need those yeasts you need those

2814
01:58:53,099 --> 01:58:59,300
um lower successionary fungal uh

2815
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:02,039
um

2816
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:06,119
life forms I'm going to use that term

2817
01:59:02,039 --> 01:59:09,060
because there's so much we don't know

2818
01:59:06,118 --> 01:59:11,118
so little in that paper they talked

2819
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:13,099
about knowing about

2820
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:15,839
.01

2821
01:59:13,099 --> 01:59:18,239
about what the [ __ ] is really going on

2822
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:20,579
in these bylaws when I read that I

2823
01:59:18,238 --> 01:59:22,439
actually screenshot it and circled it

2824
01:59:20,579 --> 01:59:24,719
and sent it to some of my compost

2825
01:59:22,439 --> 01:59:28,559
friends I'm like do you know we only

2826
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:31,859
know what 0.01 of of the microbes even

2827
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:34,260
are like I I was astonished to realize

2828
01:59:31,859 --> 01:59:37,439
that we know almost nothing about what's

2829
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:40,260
in our soil uh-huh and and then worse

2830
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:42,059
yet uh the interactions

2831
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:43,079
and those interactions are the key to

2832
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:45,719
the whole thing

2833
01:59:43,079 --> 01:59:49,559
like like why does the thermophite heat

2834
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:51,719
up why why is why is that getting out of

2835
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:53,340
control why is it because I put so much

2836
01:59:51,719 --> 01:59:55,520
nitrogen in there that if this pile is

2837
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:57,599
going to combust like what is that

2838
01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:00,300
biogeochemical process that's happening

2839
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:01,679
that's creating so much heat it's it

2840
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:04,400
gets crazy

2841
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:07,739
um so you know that being said

2842
02:00:04,399 --> 02:00:11,158
IMO works so great because it's putting

2843
02:00:07,738 --> 02:00:13,799
all of the foods and the successionary

2844
02:00:11,158 --> 02:00:16,618
species that need to be present for some

2845
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:18,179
of these older later succession species

2846
02:00:16,618 --> 02:00:20,759
to come into play

2847
02:00:18,179 --> 02:00:23,760
so um

2848
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:28,099
in in understanding the compost process

2849
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:31,320
in getting a fungally dominated compost

2850
02:00:28,099 --> 02:00:34,079
you've got to have those yeasts to to

2851
02:00:31,319 --> 02:00:35,939
even begin to get the sap robes to come

2852
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:37,859
in and do their thing and we're not

2853
02:00:35,939 --> 02:00:40,079
going to get into my Horizon but we're

2854
02:00:37,859 --> 02:00:43,259
going to stay with decomposing fungi for

2855
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:45,960
right now and the yeasts and the moles

2856
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:49,320
those are decomposers so they're good

2857
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:50,939
guys to have to bring in think of prey

2858
02:00:49,319 --> 02:00:52,859
Predator we talk about this all the time

2859
02:00:50,939 --> 02:00:55,799
so the yeast

2860
02:00:52,859 --> 02:00:58,139
the molds are like deer and the sap

2861
02:00:55,800 --> 02:01:00,239
robes are like the saber-toothed tiger

2862
02:00:58,139 --> 02:01:03,659
or the leopard that's going to come in

2863
02:01:00,238 --> 02:01:05,698
and eat them so that's how you get that

2864
02:01:03,658 --> 02:01:08,158
system to start functioning is by

2865
02:01:05,698 --> 02:01:10,138
creating the prey so that the Predators

2866
02:01:08,158 --> 02:01:11,638
come in

2867
02:01:10,139 --> 02:01:14,279
um so where are we going to get our

2868
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:16,980
Predators from well we get them from old

2869
02:01:14,279 --> 02:01:19,460
rotten wood chips that's one of the

2870
02:01:16,979 --> 02:01:23,399
major sources for getting

2871
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:25,679
decomposing saprobe fungi you call

2872
02:01:23,399 --> 02:01:27,359
mycelium a lot of people don't

2873
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:30,899
understand that mycelium is actually

2874
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:32,579
like a chord it's filled with hundreds

2875
02:01:30,899 --> 02:01:34,439
if not hundreds of thousands of

2876
02:01:32,579 --> 02:01:36,238
different individual organisms that are

2877
02:01:34,439 --> 02:01:40,138
all working together

2878
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:42,839
uh like a internet Super Highway and

2879
02:01:40,139 --> 02:01:45,440
that white coating on the outside that

2880
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:48,480
is actually a protection uh against

2881
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:50,698
oxidation so that when if that if that

2882
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:54,539
individual organism that individual sap

2883
02:01:50,698 --> 02:01:56,879
robe actually got exposed to oxygen it

2884
02:01:54,539 --> 02:01:59,399
would disintegrate or or exposed to UV

2885
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:01,980
it would it would disintegrate so that

2886
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:04,259
white coating is actually to basically

2887
02:02:01,979 --> 02:02:06,419
think of it as the the wrapping around

2888
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:08,579
your electrical cord it's to prevent

2889
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:09,599
something from going catastrophically

2890
02:02:08,579 --> 02:02:11,158
wrong

2891
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:14,340
and

2892
02:02:11,158 --> 02:02:18,299
the the most interesting component of

2893
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:20,639
that is that when you find that you've

2894
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:23,159
that mycelial cord in your

2895
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:25,679
old two-year-old wood chips and you pick

2896
02:02:23,158 --> 02:02:27,960
it up and all those other little pieces

2897
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:31,260
of of organic matter are hanging on like

2898
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:32,099
a web underneath it now you know you've

2899
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:35,219
got

2900
02:02:32,099 --> 02:02:38,579
uh many many different later

2901
02:02:35,219 --> 02:02:41,340
successionary species of sap ropes so

2902
02:02:38,579 --> 02:02:43,319
that's why again if you if you take the

2903
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:45,719
time to actually Harvest these chips

2904
02:02:43,319 --> 02:02:48,238
that are loaded with mycelium and you

2905
02:02:45,719 --> 02:02:50,639
heat it up over 120. you just wasted all

2906
02:02:48,238 --> 02:02:52,738
your time you killed everything

2907
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:55,020
so that's why it's so important that you

2908
02:02:52,738 --> 02:02:58,379
keep this at a lower temperature so that

2909
02:02:55,020 --> 02:03:01,320
they will colonize your organic matter

2910
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:04,020
so that when you go to actually strip it

2911
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:07,019
or use it they have gone through a

2912
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:08,760
sporulation phase where they have

2913
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:11,940
uh until a point where they grew out a

2914
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:13,920
ton of spores or clubs or feet depending

2915
02:03:11,939 --> 02:03:16,439
on you know which

2916
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:19,079
Camp you want to talk about as far as

2917
02:03:16,439 --> 02:03:22,379
you know what the different sexual

2918
02:03:19,079 --> 02:03:25,679
methods that this fungi do to produce

2919
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:28,260
their offspring

2920
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:31,319
so I want to ask you about these

2921
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:33,239
different sources for these mycelium

2922
02:03:31,319 --> 02:03:36,059
these varieties of fungals because we

2923
02:03:33,238 --> 02:03:38,939
know we want them and we know we want a

2924
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:42,539
as you know as wide of a variety as we

2925
02:03:38,939 --> 02:03:45,178
can and we know that the these you know

2926
02:03:42,539 --> 02:03:48,840
using IMO indigenous microorganisms

2927
02:03:45,179 --> 02:03:51,779
that's like a uh that's a a simple

2928
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:53,940
low-level version that will evolve some

2929
02:03:51,779 --> 02:03:57,000
fungals which is great but then we're

2930
02:03:53,939 --> 02:03:59,698
also going to throw uh wood chips into

2931
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:02,039
our our pile because we want to capture

2932
02:03:59,698 --> 02:04:04,439
these hundreds if not thousands of

2933
02:04:02,039 --> 02:04:05,760
varieties of fungals I'm guessing though

2934
02:04:04,439 --> 02:04:09,719
that

2935
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:12,659
um we probably want to pull our funcles

2936
02:04:09,719 --> 02:04:15,539
from a couple different sources so uh

2937
02:04:12,658 --> 02:04:18,779
you know uh you know our IMO box is

2938
02:04:15,539 --> 02:04:21,060
fantastic uh our our wood chips that's

2939
02:04:18,779 --> 02:04:25,618
fabulous what are a couple other places

2940
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:27,780
that I want to hunt for wild crafting

2941
02:04:25,618 --> 02:04:30,479
these fungals to bring it back and put

2942
02:04:27,779 --> 02:04:33,779
it in my pile so I can have it be not

2943
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:36,419
only fungally dominant but hella diverse

2944
02:04:33,779 --> 02:04:39,420
fungally dominant all right so let's

2945
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:42,480
let's clean up uh the Achilles heel of

2946
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:45,060
IMO so

2947
02:04:42,479 --> 02:04:49,019
it is taught and most people understand

2948
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:52,619
or believe that that IMO collection IMO

2949
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:55,320
one is going to have all of the fungal

2950
02:04:52,618 --> 02:04:58,019
constituents that you're looking for it

2951
02:04:55,319 --> 02:04:59,579
does not it only has the foundation the

2952
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:01,199
yeast and yeah it's probably got some

2953
02:04:59,579 --> 02:05:03,059
spores

2954
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:06,238
but it's not

2955
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:08,760
nearly as diverse as one would think uh

2956
02:05:06,238 --> 02:05:11,098
generally you see the the microscope

2957
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:13,679
slides people post on Instagram those

2958
02:05:11,099 --> 02:05:16,440
are called pin molds they're very

2959
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:19,319
important uh foundational creatures for

2960
02:05:16,439 --> 02:05:22,500
succession to occur so are you producing

2961
02:05:19,319 --> 02:05:26,340
a [ __ ] ton of pin molds but when you

2962
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:28,020
introduce IMO 3 which again is going to

2963
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:29,579
be uh

2964
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:31,199
uh

2965
02:05:29,579 --> 02:05:33,238
very

2966
02:05:31,198 --> 02:05:37,079
pin mold heavy

2967
02:05:33,238 --> 02:05:39,479
and you introduce that into a imo4 which

2968
02:05:37,079 --> 02:05:41,399
is when you blend it with soil

2969
02:05:39,479 --> 02:05:43,979
that's when you're really going to get

2970
02:05:41,399 --> 02:05:45,539
your fungal colonization that's when

2971
02:05:43,979 --> 02:05:48,419
you're going to get your sap robes your

2972
02:05:45,539 --> 02:05:50,158
your more later succession fungi to come

2973
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:51,960
into play because there's the food there

2974
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:54,000
for them right there's all those pin

2975
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:55,920
molds doing all their thing that is

2976
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,198
providing the foundation or the paving

2977
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,399
the highway for the sap ropes to come

2978
02:05:58,198 --> 02:06:00,779
into play

2979
02:05:59,399 --> 02:06:03,899
so

2980
02:06:00,779 --> 02:06:08,099
if you're looking for you know a

2981
02:06:03,899 --> 02:06:10,979
slow version of of getting to a fungal

2982
02:06:08,099 --> 02:06:13,319
dominance then yeah that works great but

2983
02:06:10,979 --> 02:06:17,098
the problem is if you don't have super

2984
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:19,500
healthy soil to blend with your imo3

2985
02:06:17,099 --> 02:06:22,920
you're not going to get this the kind of

2986
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:24,859
fungally dominant compost that you're or

2987
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:29,579
organic matter that you're talking about

2988
02:06:24,859 --> 02:06:32,698
so back to how do I get this into my low

2989
02:06:29,579 --> 02:06:35,639
temp pile all right so number one is is

2990
02:06:32,698 --> 02:06:38,279
finding the old one to two-year-old

2991
02:06:35,639 --> 02:06:40,500
Punky wood chips with the mycelium

2992
02:06:38,279 --> 02:06:42,899
is going to have tremendous diversity in

2993
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:45,000
it because that cord the thicker the

2994
02:06:42,899 --> 02:06:46,379
cords are and the more long and Webby

2995
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,618
the chords are the more different

2996
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:50,520
organisms you're getting saprobes

2997
02:06:49,618 --> 02:06:52,380
um

2998
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:55,619
the other piece of this puzzle too is

2999
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:57,960
foods like what are fungal Foods well we

3000
02:06:55,618 --> 02:06:59,519
know like steel cut oats

3001
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:01,579
um there's a bunch of them and you you

3002
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:03,800
can research this on your own

3003
02:07:01,579 --> 02:07:06,618
but the other

3004
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:10,619
wonderful place to get

3005
02:07:06,618 --> 02:07:14,698
saprobes are from Leaf Duff

3006
02:07:10,618 --> 02:07:16,679
so I talk about uh prevailing wind right

3007
02:07:14,698 --> 02:07:19,919
so everywhere you go there's generally

3008
02:07:16,679 --> 02:07:22,319
what we consider uh the winds Direction

3009
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:25,020
the most days is going to be blowing in

3010
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:26,460
this direction so basically you go to

3011
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:30,000
wherever

3012
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:32,698
um there's a stone wall a downed tree a

3013
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,460
creek or a depression and the leaves

3014
02:07:32,698 --> 02:07:36,859
that blow across the yard will fall in a

3015
02:07:35,460 --> 02:07:40,260
natural pile

3016
02:07:36,859 --> 02:07:43,799
either behind that log or you know in

3017
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:48,980
that depression there you go there's an

3018
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:52,440
incredibly diverse uh indigenous sapra

3019
02:07:48,979 --> 02:07:54,598
fungi Factory for you to add to your

3020
02:07:52,439 --> 02:07:57,719
compost so again diversity diversity

3021
02:07:54,599 --> 02:08:00,480
diversity leaves chips

3022
02:07:57,719 --> 02:08:03,179
uh hey hey it's another good one or not

3023
02:08:00,479 --> 02:08:06,658
hey straw straws is already going to

3024
02:08:03,179 --> 02:08:09,658
have decomposers attached to it

3025
02:08:06,658 --> 02:08:11,519
um and then yeah if you can add some

3026
02:08:09,658 --> 02:08:13,279
Amic acids

3027
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:15,480
um they're also a very good again

3028
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:18,539
biological superfood they're good for

3029
02:08:15,479 --> 02:08:20,638
both bacterial and fungal kingdoms

3030
02:08:18,539 --> 02:08:23,579
um then you're gonna have uh incredible

3031
02:08:20,639 --> 02:08:26,039
success and then there's one last piece

3032
02:08:23,579 --> 02:08:27,899
of this puzzle if you're in a place

3033
02:08:26,039 --> 02:08:29,698
where you don't have access to these

3034
02:08:27,899 --> 02:08:32,460
kinds of things you can you go to your

3035
02:08:29,698 --> 02:08:34,319
local mushroom producer and ask him for

3036
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:36,779
a spat mushroom block you do not want

3037
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:39,238
mushroom compost because mushroom

3038
02:08:36,779 --> 02:08:41,519
compost has gone thermophilic and

3039
02:08:39,238 --> 02:08:44,158
they've been forced to kill all of the

3040
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:46,560
biology because that's what the USDA

3041
02:08:44,158 --> 02:08:48,899
requires of anybody who's making

3042
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:51,360
commercial compost has to hit that

3043
02:08:48,899 --> 02:08:53,219
temperature usually it's 150 three times

3044
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:55,859
over the course of x amount of days

3045
02:08:53,219 --> 02:08:57,779
depending on what state you're in

3046
02:08:55,859 --> 02:08:59,519
um so if you get mushroom compost you're

3047
02:08:57,779 --> 02:09:01,979
getting you're not getting organisms if

3048
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:03,780
you if you hit the mushroom block now

3049
02:09:01,979 --> 02:09:05,939
you're getting the organisms

3050
02:09:03,779 --> 02:09:08,460
wow that's really cool I have access to

3051
02:09:05,939 --> 02:09:09,779
many mushroom blocks which I will now go

3052
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:11,880
get

3053
02:09:09,779 --> 02:09:14,158
um so I want to I want to take this idea

3054
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:16,020
of wild crafting it I want to kind of

3055
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:19,138
say I want to apply what you just said

3056
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:21,420
to my world and and and then everybody

3057
02:09:19,139 --> 02:09:23,400
can kind of like do that in their own

3058
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:26,340
heads for where they live so you're

3059
02:09:23,399 --> 02:09:29,039
talking about uh collecting these Leaf

3060
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:30,659
collections that have naturally come

3061
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:32,880
together

3062
02:09:30,658 --> 02:09:35,579
um you know in indentations and along

3063
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:38,099
tree lines and stuff like that and so so

3064
02:09:35,579 --> 02:09:41,158
if if I'm wanting to do that kind of

3065
02:09:38,099 --> 02:09:43,980
collection in my neighborhood and so

3066
02:09:41,158 --> 02:09:47,039
that I have got the widest uh diversity

3067
02:09:43,979 --> 02:09:50,579
of fungals uh in my cold compost as

3068
02:09:47,039 --> 02:09:53,460
possible for me I would for example my

3069
02:09:50,579 --> 02:09:56,279
neighbor has got a long fence

3070
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:58,020
and so the leaves like we I've all seen

3071
02:09:56,279 --> 02:10:00,059
in like you know Suburban neighborhoods

3072
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:02,880
even though I live way out

3073
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:05,940
um the the leaves blow against the fence

3074
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:08,340
and they collect at the bottom and so I

3075
02:10:05,939 --> 02:10:11,098
can imagine going over there with a five

3076
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:13,139
gallon bucket and just like like you

3077
02:10:11,099 --> 02:10:16,020
know smooshing all of these leaves

3078
02:10:13,139 --> 02:10:18,000
together and filling that bucket up and

3079
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:20,580
so then okay great I've got a I've got a

3080
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:23,698
collection from this particular bio

3081
02:10:20,579 --> 02:10:27,539
region along my neighbor's fence I also

3082
02:10:23,698 --> 02:10:31,319
have got this um uh huge ass uh Tree in

3083
02:10:27,539 --> 02:10:34,260
my yard and um because it the the base

3084
02:10:31,319 --> 02:10:36,420
of the tree kind of swells up because of

3085
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:38,760
the old root structure there's always a

3086
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:41,158
whole bunch of like magic like sitting

3087
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:42,539
in there too plus as as you've talked

3088
02:10:41,158 --> 02:10:44,819
about before

3089
02:10:42,539 --> 02:10:46,979
um there's all of these these yeasts

3090
02:10:44,819 --> 02:10:49,319
these imos that actually kind of fall

3091
02:10:46,979 --> 02:10:51,899
from these trees these these fungal

3092
02:10:49,319 --> 02:10:53,880
dusts that fall from the trees so so all

3093
02:10:51,899 --> 02:10:55,979
right I will collect all of the leaves

3094
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:57,420
that are at the bottom of the tree as

3095
02:10:55,979 --> 02:11:00,319
well and I'm going to get a little of

3096
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:05,219
this little fur fur pit bits and

3097
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:08,539
Fir fur bits and uh and some leaves and

3098
02:11:05,219 --> 02:11:11,039
you know I don't know random

3099
02:11:08,539 --> 02:11:13,019
organic matter debris and so like I'll

3100
02:11:11,039 --> 02:11:16,560
fill a bucket with that and then and

3101
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:18,420
then maybe I would go over to the um the

3102
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:20,159
Estuary here on the island go over to

3103
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:21,658
like Fern Cove

3104
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:25,198
um because there's all these different

3105
02:11:21,658 --> 02:11:27,779
leaves that that get collected in the

3106
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:30,178
brush that is along the along with salt

3107
02:11:27,779 --> 02:11:32,939
water so so maybe I'll get some salt

3108
02:11:30,179 --> 02:11:34,980
spray and like a different variety of

3109
02:11:32,939 --> 02:11:37,259
funguses because that's a yet another

3110
02:11:34,979 --> 02:11:39,359
different environment and I'm thinking

3111
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:40,860
to myself I want to I want the

3112
02:11:39,359 --> 02:11:42,779
environments to be different because

3113
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:44,579
these different biological environments

3114
02:11:42,779 --> 02:11:46,618
are going to have different fungals so

3115
02:11:44,579 --> 02:11:48,238
now I've got like these three buckets

3116
02:11:46,618 --> 02:11:49,500
full and of course this could be you

3117
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:51,000
know you could do as many as you want

3118
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:53,939
but for this example I got these three

3119
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:57,899
buckets and I'm now gonna put those in

3120
02:11:53,939 --> 02:12:01,079
the pile along with my IMO and so I've

3121
02:11:57,899 --> 02:12:04,799
got I've got the the very basic IMO

3122
02:12:01,079 --> 02:12:07,500
yeasts and I've got the way more complex

3123
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:10,079
fungals from three different areas near

3124
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:14,460
where I live plus I've got all this

3125
02:12:10,079 --> 02:12:16,679
higher end cool mycelial action going on

3126
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:21,480
and all the hangers on that you

3127
02:12:16,679 --> 02:12:24,599
mentioned and so boom is is that by

3128
02:12:21,479 --> 02:12:29,218
ideal yes um just a couple little points

3129
02:12:24,599 --> 02:12:31,500
so when you're collecting Leaf stuff

3130
02:12:29,219 --> 02:12:33,779
you really want to scrape back the dry

3131
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:36,060
leaves on the top and you want to get

3132
02:12:33,779 --> 02:12:37,579
down into the layer where they're kind

3133
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:40,440
of slimy

3134
02:12:37,579 --> 02:12:42,539
that's where the magic is not in the in

3135
02:12:40,439 --> 02:12:44,638
the top layer that's dried out the top

3136
02:12:42,539 --> 02:12:47,460
layer that's dried out will then get

3137
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:49,800
covered by this year's crop of leaves

3138
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:52,520
and that'll press down and then become

3139
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:55,520
the wet nasty slimy

3140
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:58,380
underneath for for The Following season

3141
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:00,659
so you're again you're looking to get

3142
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:04,980
partially decomposed naturally

3143
02:13:00,658 --> 02:13:07,460
decomposed organic matter in the form of

3144
02:13:04,979 --> 02:13:11,519
leaves that have started to break down

3145
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:14,279
and I always encourage people to maybe

3146
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:17,280
this is the perfect place to use that

3147
02:13:14,279 --> 02:13:19,559
commercial compost for six bucks is is

3148
02:13:17,279 --> 02:13:22,859
to wild craft responsibly and bring

3149
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:25,619
something in and leave that in place of

3150
02:13:22,859 --> 02:13:28,319
what you've taken out so that way if you

3151
02:13:25,618 --> 02:13:32,158
spread you know you've taken out say six

3152
02:13:28,319 --> 02:13:34,979
feet of of this uh you know top inch or

3153
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:37,019
two of this leaf mold you can then

3154
02:13:34,979 --> 02:13:39,238
spread that commercial compost down and

3155
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:41,520
then cover it back up with the with the

3156
02:13:39,238 --> 02:13:43,919
dried out leaves and you've not just

3157
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:46,320
just totally Disturbed or [ __ ] Nature

3158
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:47,819
by leaving a big scar oh I love that and

3159
02:13:46,319 --> 02:13:49,679
we've already talked about how while it

3160
02:13:47,819 --> 02:13:51,479
might not really work well for a compost

3161
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:54,359
it actually works great as a fertilizer

3162
02:13:51,479 --> 02:13:57,238
and so and so we are we are helping

3163
02:13:54,359 --> 02:13:59,779
diversify that area right on wow okay

3164
02:13:57,238 --> 02:14:02,759
cool and then one other piece for

3165
02:13:59,779 --> 02:14:05,399
mushroom blocks is that people have to

3166
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:06,719
understand that when they take that

3167
02:14:05,399 --> 02:14:08,759
mushroom block

3168
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:12,739
um and they leave it it's going to get

3169
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:16,199
this liquid slimy stuff in the bag

3170
02:14:12,738 --> 02:14:18,839
that's actually a biocide that's

3171
02:14:16,198 --> 02:14:21,059
produced by the fungi to protect from

3172
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:23,819
bacterial infections and or yeast

3173
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:26,579
infections or anything else that fungi

3174
02:14:23,819 --> 02:14:29,759
is doing everything it's can to to build

3175
02:14:26,578 --> 02:14:32,460
a fortress with the white cake around

3176
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:36,360
the outside edge but it's also releasing

3177
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:39,118
these uh biotoxins to fight off anybody

3178
02:14:36,359 --> 02:14:40,920
that could possibly compete with them so

3179
02:14:39,118 --> 02:14:43,078
what I generally tell people to do is

3180
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:46,679
take the bag

3181
02:14:43,078 --> 02:14:49,920
and run it over with your car on soil

3182
02:14:46,679 --> 02:14:52,920
so you smashed it and then just leave it

3183
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:55,500
in the bag so it gets nasty it should

3184
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:57,739
get all different colors in it but it

3185
02:14:55,500 --> 02:15:00,539
shouldn't have any real liquid build up

3186
02:14:57,738 --> 02:15:02,279
because that's the biocide that you do

3187
02:15:00,539 --> 02:15:03,960
not want to add to your compost pile

3188
02:15:02,279 --> 02:15:06,719
because you will knock back your

3189
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:08,719
diversity so the dealing with mushroom

3190
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:12,359
blocks is a little bit more

3191
02:15:08,719 --> 02:15:15,139
creative than than one might think but

3192
02:15:12,359 --> 02:15:17,519
the longer you let those blocks dry out

3193
02:15:15,139 --> 02:15:20,279
and if it's raining it's raining doesn't

3194
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:23,639
matter just just don't allow that

3195
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:26,340
biocide to build up in the bag run it

3196
02:15:23,639 --> 02:15:28,380
over you know you don't want to rip all

3197
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:30,360
the plastic off leave leave the plastic

3198
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:33,359
on it until you're ready to actually

3199
02:15:30,359 --> 02:15:34,799
introduce it into your compost pile and

3200
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:36,899
then when you're going to introduce it

3201
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:39,300
into your compost pile it's going to

3202
02:15:36,899 --> 02:15:41,698
have this funky smell to it and again

3203
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:45,000
remember our noses are there to protect

3204
02:15:41,698 --> 02:15:46,319
us to warn us from dangers so when you

3205
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,880
smell it you're going to kind of like

3206
02:15:46,319 --> 02:15:49,559
pull your head back and go oh that

3207
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:52,078
smells really funky

3208
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:54,480
yeah that's okay it's kind of like when

3209
02:15:52,078 --> 02:15:56,039
you ferment things it smells funky like

3210
02:15:54,479 --> 02:15:58,259
you're not going to want to eat this

3211
02:15:56,039 --> 02:16:00,979
stuff but when it has that funky smell

3212
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:03,659
to it you know it's ready it's going to

3213
02:16:00,979 --> 02:16:06,178
be providing all kinds of secondary

3214
02:16:03,658 --> 02:16:08,698
tertiary metabolites for everything to

3215
02:16:06,179 --> 02:16:10,618
kick in the only part of that I want to

3216
02:16:08,698 --> 02:16:13,439
tease at is the running over it with

3217
02:16:10,618 --> 02:16:18,719
your car I I believe that the car is the

3218
02:16:13,439 --> 02:16:21,539
only our goal is to break up the cake so

3219
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:24,239
that the the white on the outside that

3220
02:16:21,539 --> 02:16:25,738
is providing the protective barrier for

3221
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:28,019
the cake

3222
02:16:25,738 --> 02:16:32,398
um gets destroyed right like that's

3223
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:34,139
Disturbed Disturbed okay so so like the

3224
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:36,840
cakes that I have come in contact with

3225
02:16:34,138 --> 02:16:39,718
actually break up very easily in the bag

3226
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:42,000
by hand and so it would be just as

3227
02:16:39,718 --> 02:16:44,398
effective if I just take the bag and I

3228
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,558
hold it you know well with my two hands

3229
02:16:44,398 --> 02:16:49,500
and just you know twist my hands in

3230
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:51,959
different directions and so break the X2

3231
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:54,359
interior of the cake up a bit and then

3232
02:16:51,959 --> 02:16:58,039
just go with that right there's that's

3233
02:16:54,359 --> 02:16:58,040
that's the only goal of it right

3234
02:16:58,978 --> 02:17:03,420
with uh

3235
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:06,300
I can't explain it biogeochemical

3236
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:10,679
process that that's occurring but I have

3237
02:17:06,299 --> 02:17:12,659
noticed that when I do run it over uh

3238
02:17:10,679 --> 02:17:14,239
again I'm not I'm not trying to break it

3239
02:17:12,659 --> 02:17:17,218
up I'm trying to just kind of like

3240
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:19,920
squish out any of the biocide and

3241
02:17:17,218 --> 02:17:23,039
disturb that that outer coating so that

3242
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:24,898
now the local indigenous biology can

3243
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:26,820
come into play and have fun with it as

3244
02:17:24,898 --> 02:17:28,558
well because there's still a tremendous

3245
02:17:26,819 --> 02:17:32,099
amount of resources

3246
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:35,159
in a nutritional value that's locked up

3247
02:17:32,099 --> 02:17:37,920
in that block that that fungi is trying

3248
02:17:35,159 --> 02:17:40,260
to protect so I want to I want to expose

3249
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:42,058
it to my local environment so I'm

3250
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:44,700
getting all of my indigenous

3251
02:17:42,058 --> 02:17:47,039
microorganisms to colonize it as well so

3252
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:50,099
that's why I'm saying like just run it

3253
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:52,080
over uh again you don't want to tear the

3254
02:17:50,099 --> 02:17:54,659
bag off of it you just want to you just

3255

3280
02:18:52,019 --> 02:18:56,460
for decades Americans have enjoyed

3281

cannabis flowers and joints and bongs

3282
02:18:56,459 --> 02:19:01,018

so before during the break late and I

3420
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:37,560
were talking about uh the inputs that

3421
02:24:34,859 --> 02:24:40,800
for this cold compost

3422
02:24:37,559 --> 02:24:44,398
um because when I visited him there in

3423
02:24:40,799 --> 02:24:46,559
Ventura uh I don't know right before

3424
02:24:44,398 --> 02:24:48,358
kovidi started

3425
02:24:46,559 --> 02:24:49,739
um he had all this stuff in his backyard

3426
02:24:48,359 --> 02:24:51,659
that he was growing it all looked like

3427
02:24:49,739 --> 02:24:53,340
like weeds and shrubs and stuff and I'm

3428
02:24:51,659 --> 02:24:54,539
all like oh you know what are these

3429
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:55,978
plants and you're like oh I'm growing

3430
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:58,620
this stuff for my compost and I didn't

3431
02:24:55,978 --> 02:25:00,478
think much about it and moved on

3432
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:01,740
um but it's not until today that I

3433
02:25:00,478 --> 02:25:04,799
realized

3434
02:25:01,739 --> 02:25:07,318
um whereas most of us will wild craft

3435
02:25:04,799 --> 02:25:09,898
our inputs for the compost or or we just

3436
02:25:07,318 --> 02:25:12,000
produce it like you know

3437
02:25:09,898 --> 02:25:13,858
um you know air quotes accidentally on

3438
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,100
our property

3439
02:25:13,859 --> 02:25:22,260
um Leighton you actually are growing

3440
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:25,380
um green inputs that you know you like

3441
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:28,700
for making your cold compost and the

3442
02:25:25,379 --> 02:25:32,339
idea of of growing specific things

3443
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:34,140
intentionally just to to kill it for

3444
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:36,299
your compost is really interesting and

3445
02:25:34,139 --> 02:25:38,699
and and I found it kind of inspiring and

3446
02:25:36,299 --> 02:25:41,340
I'm probably not the only one so before

3447
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:44,100
we like move on um why don't you just

3448
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:46,739
hit on that like like what what are you

3449
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:48,680
growing for your compost and and why do

3450
02:25:46,739 --> 02:25:51,959
you bother

3451
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:56,460
well that's a good question

3452
02:25:51,959 --> 02:25:59,759
um Chango uh I've found that again

3453
02:25:56,459 --> 02:26:03,059
diversity diversity diversity is the key

3454
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:04,800
to making some incredible end products

3455
02:26:03,059 --> 02:26:08,639
and so

3456
02:26:04,799 --> 02:26:13,139
um yeah I grow uh indigenous uh grasses

3457
02:26:08,639 --> 02:26:16,019
pollinator plants flowers uh even even

3458
02:26:13,139 --> 02:26:18,420
some little shrubs and and basically I

3459
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:22,439
don't kill them I just cut them back

3460
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:24,780
from time to time I don't let things go

3461
02:26:22,439 --> 02:26:26,520
to seed that I put into the pile so if I

3462
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:29,280
see something that's going to seed out I

3463
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:31,380
either just let it seed out and then

3464
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:33,300
wait till it's done seeding and then

3465
02:26:31,379 --> 02:26:35,699
take the brown because the plant dies

3466
02:26:33,299 --> 02:26:37,259
after it seeds out and just make sure

3467
02:26:35,700 --> 02:26:40,200
that I'm getting all the seeds off of it

3468
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:42,120
and leave them in place in the soil and

3469
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:44,760
then the greens of course I I trim back

3470
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:46,800
the grasses I love flowers in my compost

3471
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:48,739
pile I think they just bring a whole

3472
02:26:46,799 --> 02:26:51,898
other level of

3473
02:26:48,739 --> 02:26:53,159
biological uh superfoods to to the

3474
02:26:51,898 --> 02:26:55,139
decomposers that they wouldn't

3475
02:26:53,159 --> 02:26:57,299
ordinarily get

3476
02:26:55,139 --> 02:26:59,279
um so yeah I think that everybody if you

3477
02:26:57,299 --> 02:27:01,858
got a little corner somewhere you can

3478
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:04,380
obviously just buy green manures seeds

3479
02:27:01,859 --> 02:27:08,220
or wildflower seeds or whatever

3480
02:27:04,379 --> 02:27:10,799
whatever's locally grown or uh locally

3481
02:27:08,219 --> 02:27:13,500
responsibly grown in your area

3482
02:27:10,799 --> 02:27:16,199
why wouldn't you and again you know I'm

3483
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:19,079
I'm blessed I don't go through a

3484
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:21,659
a harsh winter here yes we have certain

3485
02:27:19,079 --> 02:27:23,700
plants that do die back in in the Colder

3486
02:27:21,659 --> 02:27:26,700
Weather but for the most part everything

3487
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:28,800
pretty much grows year round so I'm very

3488
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:32,819
blessed in that regard but if I was to

3489
02:27:28,799 --> 02:27:34,619
say do this in New England

3490
02:27:32,818 --> 02:27:37,139
um I typically would build a pile in

3491
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:38,939
Spring and I'd build a pile and fall so

3492
02:27:37,139 --> 02:27:41,760
I'd be harvesting

3493
02:27:38,939 --> 02:27:43,920
um you know the the whatever I could get

3494
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:46,020
my hands on in the spring like the new

3495
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:47,700
stuff that was popping up

3496
02:27:46,020 --> 02:27:50,100
um and then in the fall I would

3497
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:52,020
obviously be collecting stuff uh

3498
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:54,420
throughout the summer to to build the

3499
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:56,520
pile and the pile in the fall so it's a

3500
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:59,280
little bit trickier in in an area where

3501
02:27:56,520 --> 02:28:02,100
you have a true hard winter to do this

3502
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:04,079
but even if you only Built one pile a

3503
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:05,818
year you'd be fine

3504
02:28:04,079 --> 02:28:08,159
um but you yeah there's no reason why

3505
02:28:05,818 --> 02:28:10,439
you can't Harvest

3506
02:28:08,159 --> 02:28:13,439
um the the local you know or grow

3507
02:28:10,439 --> 02:28:14,700
whatever you feel is is important for

3508
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:16,260
your area

3509
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:18,120
um and then use the biomass in your

3510
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:19,620
compost pile I like the idea because you

3511
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:21,240
kind of put it on its head right because

3512
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:22,800
like I take this stuff you know I grow

3513
02:28:21,239 --> 02:28:24,420
flowers and all this kind of stuff on my

3514
02:28:22,799 --> 02:28:27,478
property too and I just they naturally

3515
02:28:24,420 --> 02:28:29,340
find their way into a pile but the fact

3516
02:28:27,478 --> 02:28:31,500
that you kind of went backwards and

3517
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:35,460
you're like okay what stuff do I like in

3518
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:37,260
my compost that and now I'm going to

3519
02:28:35,459 --> 02:28:39,239
grow that like

3520
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:42,478
um it's it's a diff it's it's a subtle

3521
02:28:39,239 --> 02:28:44,459
but important difference from oh I I

3522
02:28:42,478 --> 02:28:46,799
grew all this stuff because I just like

3523
02:28:44,459 --> 02:28:50,219
the flowers and I hope it makes good

3524
02:28:46,799 --> 02:28:52,438
compost versus I want good compost so

3525
02:28:50,219 --> 02:28:55,619
I'm going to pick the flowers and

3526
02:28:52,439 --> 02:28:57,898
grasses that make good compost that also

3527
02:28:55,620 --> 02:29:00,060
I happen to like it's like it's it

3528
02:28:57,898 --> 02:29:01,978
changes the direction of the decision

3529
02:29:00,059 --> 02:29:03,059
making and I find that uh kind of

3530
02:29:01,978 --> 02:29:05,760
delightful

3531
02:29:03,059 --> 02:29:08,100
yeah and and don't get me wrong I mean

3532
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:10,380
I'll actually like pull up roots and use

3533
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:12,540
those in the compost as well so if

3534
02:29:10,379 --> 02:29:14,039
something seeds I'll let it seed out and

3535
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:15,359
then I'll pull that plant because I know

3536
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:18,180
I've got seeds that are going to happen

3537
02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:19,500
pop next year and I'll I'll compost that

3538
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:21,359
root ball because that's got the

3539
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:23,520
rhizosphere in it

3540
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:26,100
right on so all right so here we are in

3541
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:28,260
set three and um the the two main things

3542
02:29:26,100 --> 02:29:30,659
I want to talk about is first

3543
02:29:28,260 --> 02:29:32,760
um uh you know you have talked about the

3544
02:29:30,659 --> 02:29:36,478
mechanical ways in which you manipulate

3545
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:38,700
the organic matter to make more porous

3546
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:41,760
Community opportunities for all the life

3547
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:43,859
forms in the rhizosphere and

3548
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:45,300
um you know we've kind of just hit on

3549
02:29:43,859 --> 02:29:48,300
that a little bit and then I've refer to

3550
02:29:45,299 --> 02:29:51,358
it as massaging but like I've been to

3551
02:29:48,299 --> 02:29:54,539
your workshop and seen all the stuff

3552
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:57,479
that you do and and I think so far we've

3553
02:29:54,540 --> 02:30:00,660
given everybody a pretty good

3554
02:29:57,478 --> 02:30:04,619
um road map for how to make this at at

3555
02:30:00,659 --> 02:30:05,879
their house except for this part so

3556
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:09,140
would you

3557
02:30:05,879 --> 02:30:12,779
um take us through the different

3558
02:30:09,139 --> 02:30:16,139
mechanical manipulations that you work

3559
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:19,260
the organic matter through so that it is

3560
02:30:16,139 --> 02:30:20,099
Optimum for an inoculant

3561
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:23,520
um

3562
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:26,399
process yeah sure as a matter of fact I

3563
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:29,640
recently did a uh a video a one-hour

3564
02:30:26,398 --> 02:30:32,519
lecture and uh an outline with a friend

3565
02:30:29,639 --> 02:30:34,139
of mine Jimmy Perkins who's actually

3566
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:36,359
going to put it up online at some point

3567
02:30:34,139 --> 02:30:39,239
and we talked about charging 50 bucks

3568
02:30:36,359 --> 02:30:41,760
for it but it would be a great resource

3569
02:30:39,239 --> 02:30:43,978
for people to actually physically see

3570
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:45,420
what I'm talking about and how I go

3571
02:30:43,978 --> 02:30:47,398
about it

3572
02:30:45,420 --> 02:30:50,280
um so that's that's something that it

3573
02:30:47,398 --> 02:30:52,799
was designed for uh the homeowner so

3574
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:55,380
it's it's using mechanical forces on a

3575
02:30:52,799 --> 02:30:58,438
smaller scale than what I do

3576
02:30:55,379 --> 02:31:02,759
um but needless to say these mechanical

3577
02:30:58,439 --> 02:31:06,859
forces are scalable so I have a 85

3578
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:10,559
gallon compost or excuse me um

3579
02:31:06,859 --> 02:31:13,500
yogurt maker that I converted into uh

3580
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:15,139
one of my strippers and actually I call

3581
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:17,939
her Raquel

3582
02:31:15,139 --> 02:31:20,219
and my other stripper I call her Sandy

3583
02:31:17,939 --> 02:31:22,680
because uh I went through superstorms

3584
02:31:20,219 --> 02:31:24,420
Andy and Sandy Hook in New England and I

3585
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:26,760
said you know what poor Sandy's got a

3586
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:29,520
bad name let's let's make something good

3587
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:31,978
out of the name Sandy so the one that I

3588
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:34,920
travel with is is Sandy and it was

3589
02:31:31,978 --> 02:31:36,599
basically a older washing machine that I

3590
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:39,180
converted

3591
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:40,620
um to do this uh what I call soft

3592
02:31:39,180 --> 02:31:43,739
Collision

3593
02:31:40,620 --> 02:31:46,200
so in a soft Collision think about uh

3594
02:31:43,739 --> 02:31:48,539
the two of us standing in a pool

3595
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:51,000
um you know up to our neck in water and

3596
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:52,800
under water I punch you like you're

3597
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:54,478
gonna feel it you're gonna feel the

3598
02:31:52,799 --> 02:31:56,938
force of it but it's not going to hurt

3599
02:31:54,478 --> 02:31:59,340
you like if we were standing in the air

3600
02:31:56,939 --> 02:32:02,460
and I did that you'd you'd feel some

3601
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:04,380
serious pain so that's the kind of

3602
02:32:02,459 --> 02:32:07,559
philosophy that I want you to think

3603
02:32:04,379 --> 02:32:09,079
about when you are talking about soft

3604
02:32:07,559 --> 02:32:13,978
colliding

3605
02:32:09,079 --> 02:32:16,680
organic materials or matters together in

3606
02:32:13,978 --> 02:32:20,398
a way that you're brushing off the the

3607
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:21,979
loose pieces uh the fungi the the the

3608
02:32:20,398 --> 02:32:24,539
biology

3609
02:32:21,978 --> 02:32:29,579
you're not damaging it you're you're

3610
02:32:24,540 --> 02:32:32,819
basically using its own biomass to to

3611
02:32:29,579 --> 02:32:36,659
break off the pieces that are suitable

3612
02:32:32,818 --> 02:32:39,119
and ready to be used as poem to

3613
02:32:36,659 --> 02:32:41,219
inoculate your soil

3614
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:43,620
all right so number one is soft

3615
02:32:41,219 --> 02:32:46,199
colliding using a washing machine would

3616
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:49,140
you give a quick description of of your

3617
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:50,880
retrofit of that washing machine yeah

3618
02:32:49,139 --> 02:32:52,139
um do you have to find a really old

3619
02:32:50,879 --> 02:32:54,839
machine

3620
02:32:52,139 --> 02:32:56,760
um the newer ones have uh a lot of

3621
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:57,960
different sensors and computers thanks

3622
02:32:56,760 --> 02:33:01,680
to China

3623
02:32:57,959 --> 02:33:04,919
which I've tried desperately to convert

3624
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:06,720
uh to many many lost hours and

3625
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:09,299
frustration because as soon as I get rid

3626
02:33:06,719 --> 02:33:12,659
of this control that sensor is tripping

3627
02:33:09,299 --> 02:33:14,818
and now the machine won't go on or or I

3628
02:33:12,659 --> 02:33:17,579
I keep this control but I get rid of

3629
02:33:14,818 --> 02:33:19,439
that sensor because I don't want it and

3630
02:33:17,579 --> 02:33:22,318
then now this control will no longer

3631
02:33:19,439 --> 02:33:24,960
function properly so you have to find a

3632
02:33:22,318 --> 02:33:27,840
very uh old machine like it I don't

3633
02:33:24,959 --> 02:33:30,000
think you can get them anything after

3634
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:32,939
2000 you're probably not going to be

3635
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:35,280
able to convert so that being said

3636
02:33:32,939 --> 02:33:37,920
there's not a huge pool of these pieces

3637
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:41,040
of equipment that have survived that

3638
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:42,859
long in a junk pile so it's it's not a

3639
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:46,560
particular easy

3640
02:33:42,859 --> 02:33:50,000
way to go about this I mean I did I did

3641
02:33:46,559 --> 02:33:54,180
this conversion back uh in about

3642
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:57,420
2010 was when I made it but I had access

3643
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:58,439
to you know used appliance stores that

3644
02:33:57,420 --> 02:34:01,500
were

3645
02:33:58,439 --> 02:34:04,859
had plenty of older inventory that I

3646
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:06,840
could manipulate so bottom line is you

3647
02:34:04,859 --> 02:34:08,939
know you have to gut it so you have to

3648
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:10,920
take the whole thing apart power wash

3649
02:34:08,939 --> 02:34:13,920
the inside get rid of all the residues

3650
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:18,359
all the soap scum you gotta replace

3651
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:22,200
bearings you know check for uh wire

3652
02:34:18,359 --> 02:34:24,659
phrase but you're basically looking at

3653
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:27,659
you know taking all of the wiring out of

3654
02:34:24,659 --> 02:34:30,420
it so you basically have two functions

3655
02:34:27,659 --> 02:34:32,579
Spin and agitate and no time restriction

3656
02:34:30,420 --> 02:34:34,920
like all those little control that the

3657
02:34:32,579 --> 02:34:37,260
little dial you bypass that whole thing

3658
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:38,939
so it it's not something for the

3659
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:42,000
light-hearted you've got to be somewhat

3660
02:34:38,939 --> 02:34:43,920
of a mechanical or high Mechanical

3661
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:46,500
Aptitude and somewhat of an inventor to

3662
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:48,239
actually do this but it's possible if I

3663
02:34:46,500 --> 02:34:50,520
did it anybody could do it

3664
02:34:48,239 --> 02:34:55,079
so that being said

3665
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:57,479
um the the more simple way uh for a

3666
02:34:55,079 --> 02:35:00,600
user-friendly small scale application is

3667
02:34:57,478 --> 02:35:03,719
to just use a paint mixer or a compound

3668
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:05,280
mixer and a cordless drill on a low

3669
02:35:03,719 --> 02:35:08,219
setting and that's where I did this

3670
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:10,200
video with with Jimmy so that uh you

3671
02:35:08,219 --> 02:35:12,799
know people could see oh wow this is

3672
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:16,800
really actually quite simple

3673
02:35:12,799 --> 02:35:18,959
and in in my work I've I've taken a

3674
02:35:16,799 --> 02:35:20,519
little bit further because I'm really

3675
02:35:18,959 --> 02:35:23,818
trying to produce the most powerful

3676
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:26,520
inoculant I can so I also use

3677
02:35:23,818 --> 02:35:30,299
um along with agitation

3678
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:34,140
I use aeration so I I have a little air

3679
02:35:30,299 --> 02:35:37,799
pump that that pumps air in down into

3680
02:35:34,139 --> 02:35:39,898
the agitator and on the agitator I

3681
02:35:37,799 --> 02:35:41,699
created these whips out of polyethylene

3682
02:35:39,898 --> 02:35:43,619
pipes that go all the way out to the

3683
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:45,659
edge of the barrel so when that's going

3684
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:48,660
back and forth those are basically

3685
02:35:45,659 --> 02:35:51,799
acting as a sweep to sweep the material

3686
02:35:48,659 --> 02:35:55,139
off the floor of the uh washing machine

3687
02:35:51,799 --> 02:35:57,659
and with the aeration now is it sweeps

3688
02:35:55,139 --> 02:35:59,879
it's blowing the stuff up into the you

3689
02:35:57,659 --> 02:36:01,439
know higher up into the water column and

3690
02:35:59,879 --> 02:36:03,299
then only to sink back down in the

3691
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:05,220
center and repeat agitate and repeat

3692
02:36:03,299 --> 02:36:08,639
repeat repeat or what is it rinse and

3693
02:36:05,219 --> 02:36:11,579
repeat so by doing that I'm I'm adding

3694
02:36:08,639 --> 02:36:15,379
another level of

3695
02:36:11,579 --> 02:36:18,059
um physical Force to this organic matter

3696
02:36:15,379 --> 02:36:19,679
so it's colliding on the way up it's

3697
02:36:18,059 --> 02:36:22,079
getting swept it's getting ground it's

3698
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:24,000
getting pushed into each other and then

3699
02:36:22,079 --> 02:36:27,180
of course I'm adding a tremendous amount

3700
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:30,540
of oxygen dissolved oxygen into the

3701
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:32,939
aqueous solution of fish brew and water

3702
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:35,100
so I'm really getting another added

3703
02:36:32,939 --> 02:36:37,559
benefit by by doing that but again

3704
02:36:35,100 --> 02:36:39,840
without without a proper piece of

3705
02:36:37,559 --> 02:36:42,840
equipment it's a lot more difficult to

3706
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:46,500
do that the yogurt mixer has sweeps on

3707
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:48,000
the outside pushing in it's a cone

3708
02:36:46,500 --> 02:36:50,219
bottom and of course I've used a

3709
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,898
tremendous amount of oxygen blowing up

3710
02:36:50,219 --> 02:36:54,079
through the center of that so that's

3711
02:36:51,898 --> 02:36:56,699
creating that same aeration

3712
02:36:54,079 --> 02:36:58,920
agitation that I did with the with the

3713
02:36:56,700 --> 02:37:00,780
washing machine

3714
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:03,000
um and then on top of that I have two

3715
02:37:00,780 --> 02:37:04,620
impellers opposing each other so one

3716
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,719
impeller is pulling from the bottom and

3717
02:37:04,620 --> 02:37:08,819
throwing it up and the impeller above

3718
02:37:06,719 --> 02:37:10,739
that is actually throwing pulling from

3719
02:37:08,818 --> 02:37:13,439
the top and throwing down so I'm getting

3720
02:37:10,739 --> 02:37:16,439
three levels of of agitation with that

3721
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:18,720
piece of equipment and I the reason why

3722
02:37:16,439 --> 02:37:21,600
is because I'm trying to do it um as

3723
02:37:18,719 --> 02:37:24,000
efficient and as quick as possible so

3724
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:26,939
I'm using all the different forces uh

3725
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:29,700
possible to you know again produce a

3726
02:37:26,939 --> 02:37:32,220
high volume of uh you know super

3727
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:34,979
powerful inoculin in a short period of

3728
02:37:32,219 --> 02:37:36,299
time so if if this washing machine that

3729
02:37:34,978 --> 02:37:40,438
you have

3730
02:37:36,299 --> 02:37:43,619
um uh messed with it's got the organic

3731
02:37:40,439 --> 02:37:44,700
material and water in it

3732
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:47,939
um

3733
02:37:44,700 --> 02:37:50,460
what's coming out of it like like uh all

3734
02:37:47,939 --> 02:37:52,380
right so inside the barrel

3735
02:37:50,459 --> 02:37:54,119
um you'll see that it's got holes little

3736
02:37:52,379 --> 02:37:56,579
tiny you know eighth inch drill holes

3737
02:37:54,120 --> 02:37:59,340
all the way around it so that drill

3738
02:37:56,579 --> 02:38:01,620
those drill holes are acting as a screen

3739
02:37:59,340 --> 02:38:03,600
so when I'm washing my compost anything

3740
02:38:01,620 --> 02:38:05,520
bigger than an eighth inch isn't going

3741
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:08,520
to get through those holes it just stays

3742
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:10,739
in the barrel and when I spin it I'm now

3743
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:13,200
pulling all of that moisture out of that

3744
02:38:10,739 --> 02:38:14,939
product or out of what's left in the

3745
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:16,380
barrel and then what's left in the

3746
02:38:14,939 --> 02:38:18,359
barrel I just scoop up and I throw it

3747
02:38:16,379 --> 02:38:21,119
right back in the compost pile again

3748
02:38:18,359 --> 02:38:24,300
so that's the first level of screening

3749
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:26,939
and so and and and the water that's

3750
02:38:24,299 --> 02:38:29,699
coming out of it that is not a waste

3751
02:38:26,939 --> 02:38:31,739
product no that's actually the that's

3752
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:34,140
the goodies that's the point

3753
02:38:31,739 --> 02:38:36,780
so so you're using the water and the

3754
02:38:34,139 --> 02:38:40,139
agitation to

3755
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:41,819
um strip everything out of your organic

3756
02:38:40,139 --> 02:38:43,920
material

3757
02:38:41,818 --> 02:38:45,719
um and while while you're still going to

3758
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:48,719
throw that organic material back in the

3759
02:38:45,719 --> 02:38:51,659
pile the goal is to

3760
02:38:48,719 --> 02:38:54,358
um have the organic material give up its

3761
02:38:51,659 --> 02:38:56,459
goodies right right and release all the

3762
02:38:54,359 --> 02:38:58,559
humic acids fulvic acid secondary

3763
02:38:56,459 --> 02:39:00,119
tertiary metabolites along with all of

3764
02:38:58,559 --> 02:39:03,779
the biology that went in there and again

3765
02:39:00,120 --> 02:39:07,680
I'm using fish Brew in that process so

3766
02:39:03,780 --> 02:39:10,979
I'm basically using uh about a gallon

3767
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:13,439
and a half of fish brew and about

3768
02:39:10,978 --> 02:39:17,099
three and a half to four gallons by

3769
02:39:13,439 --> 02:39:19,739
volume of compost in that one process

3770
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:22,318
now on a smaller scale you can do this

3771
02:39:19,739 --> 02:39:25,039
in a compound bucket and you know buy a

3772
02:39:22,318 --> 02:39:27,359
quarter a gallon of uh fish Brew

3773
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:29,760
add that in there with you know a couple

3774
02:39:27,359 --> 02:39:32,818
handfuls of compost you know agitate for

3775
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:35,460
15-20 minutes on slow and you'll get the

3776
02:39:32,818 --> 02:39:39,119
same end results you just won't have

3777
02:39:35,459 --> 02:39:41,099
been as efficient in removing all of

3778
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:43,260
those organisms and components that

3779
02:39:41,100 --> 02:39:46,140
you're looking for right on and I know

3780
02:39:43,260 --> 02:39:47,880
you and I both share a a love of the

3781
02:39:46,139 --> 02:39:49,279
fish Brew product but I'm always trying

3782
02:39:47,879 --> 02:39:51,779
to make people

3783
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:55,079
self-sufficient so if somebody doesn't

3784
02:39:51,780 --> 02:39:57,659
want to buy the fish Brew they can you

3785
02:39:55,079 --> 02:40:00,420
know go their own way and collect fish

3786
02:39:57,659 --> 02:40:03,000
poop so find themselves an aquaponics

3787
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:05,460
company or whatever the point is is that

3788
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:08,579
you know fish Brew is the easy way to go

3789
02:40:05,459 --> 02:40:11,099
but but you can also do this if you use

3790
02:40:08,579 --> 02:40:13,079
your aquarium water oh absolutely

3791
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:16,020
aquarium water is wonderful I mean

3792
02:40:13,079 --> 02:40:19,439
personally I don't know why every farmer

3793
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:22,380
does not have at least a freaking you

3794
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:24,120
know aquarium at the and instead why not

3795
02:40:22,379 --> 02:40:28,019
a fish pond why not you know I always

3796
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:30,240
promote aquatic microorganisms as so

3797
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:31,859
important and one of the biggest missing

3798
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:34,739
pieces from the soil because we don't

3799
02:40:31,859 --> 02:40:36,899
have mass migration anymore we the soil

3800
02:40:34,739 --> 02:40:39,119
used to get inoculated every time a

3801
02:40:36,898 --> 02:40:42,959
migration occurred but that doesn't

3802
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:46,280
happen anymore so Amos are in my mind

3803
02:40:42,959 --> 02:40:49,619
the the foundation of of creating

3804
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:52,260
regenerative healthy soil so without

3805
02:40:49,620 --> 02:40:56,180
them what are you really accomplishing

3806
02:40:52,260 --> 02:41:00,719
so another way to to get aquatic

3807
02:40:56,180 --> 02:41:06,000
microorganisms is to do a a wild craft

3808
02:41:00,719 --> 02:41:06,898
of kelp or or algae uh duckweed any of

3809
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,898
those things

3810
02:41:06,898 --> 02:41:12,059
um and you basically in aquatic plants

3811
02:41:09,898 --> 02:41:14,699
you put them in a bucket put the wire

3812
02:41:12,059 --> 02:41:16,920
mesh on top put a brick on it so that

3813
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:20,579
the plants are all submersed below the

3814
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:23,460
water put it in the hot sun for three to

3815
02:41:20,579 --> 02:41:25,318
five days depends on where you are and

3816
02:41:23,459 --> 02:41:28,739
what temperature you're at but what

3817
02:41:25,318 --> 02:41:30,959
you'll see is a white frothy foam that

3818
02:41:28,739 --> 02:41:32,699
raises to the surface and again it's

3819
02:41:30,959 --> 02:41:34,500
going to have a funky smell so your

3820
02:41:32,700 --> 02:41:37,140
body's gonna be like ooh that's weird

3821
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:39,359
what is that so you're going to kind of

3822
02:41:37,139 --> 02:41:41,818
get a reaction to it it's not going to

3823
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:43,500
smell like poop but it's not going to

3824
02:41:41,818 --> 02:41:45,000
smell like forest floor either it's

3825
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:46,920
going to smell funky kind of like those

3826
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:49,500
mushroom blocks

3827
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:52,260
um but that is a very powerful aquatic

3828
02:41:49,500 --> 02:41:54,898
microorganism uh inoculant that you can

3829
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:57,300
pour on your compost pile and you know

3830
02:41:54,898 --> 02:41:59,519
it's funny that that you say that about

3831
02:41:57,299 --> 02:42:03,239
fish brew and I just traveled the entire

3832
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:05,220
country and I we did soil micro uh soil

3833
02:42:03,239 --> 02:42:06,539
awareness classes I I think I did seven

3834
02:42:05,219 --> 02:42:08,699
of them

3835
02:42:06,540 --> 02:42:10,319
um across the country and I had the same

3836
02:42:08,700 --> 02:42:12,000
answer at every one of them I'm like

3837
02:42:10,318 --> 02:42:13,799
dude you need fish Brew dude you need

3838
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,760
fish brew and I've got to the point

3839
02:42:13,799 --> 02:42:17,279
where I was like man these people

3840
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:19,260
probably think I own fish Brew in

3841
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:20,819
reality I don't I have no stake in it

3842
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:22,859
all I can tell you is that I've been

3843
02:42:20,818 --> 02:42:25,619
using that product

3844
02:42:22,859 --> 02:42:28,260
since rodale since the Inception of

3845
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:30,359
trying to do this actually before rodale

3846
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:31,978
I'd come to realize that there was

3847
02:42:30,359 --> 02:42:34,318
something really special about fish

3848
02:42:31,978 --> 02:42:36,599
manure because every time I put it on a

3849
02:42:34,318 --> 02:42:38,340
plant I'd see plant reaction that's the

3850
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:40,260
whole reason I went down to Rodeo to

3851
02:42:38,340 --> 02:42:42,898
talk to this woman named Elaine who had

3852
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:44,280
no idea who she was and show her this

3853
02:42:42,898 --> 02:42:46,079
stuff and put it under the microscope

3854
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:47,700
and she came back and goes holy [ __ ]

3855
02:42:46,079 --> 02:42:52,620
where did you get this

3856
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:56,100
so it is the the the missing piece of

3857
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:57,920
the pie the biology just like in soil

3858
02:42:56,100 --> 02:43:00,479
science they're missing the biology

3859
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:01,559
everybody's missing the biology and can

3860
02:43:00,478 --> 02:43:04,318
you do this

3861
02:43:01,559 --> 02:43:06,478
with your own compost absolutely you

3862
02:43:04,318 --> 02:43:08,039
have two choices time or money how much

3863
02:43:06,478 --> 02:43:10,199
time you got if you don't have a lot of

3864
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:11,340
time then you need to spend the money if

3865
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:13,380
you don't have a lot of money then

3866
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:15,898
you've got to spend the time but can you

3867
02:43:13,379 --> 02:43:18,478
do it without fish Brew absolutely but

3868
02:43:15,898 --> 02:43:21,299
it's gonna take time and end trials and

3869
02:43:18,478 --> 02:43:22,920
and you know learning how to work with

3870
02:43:21,299 --> 02:43:25,259
um aquatic organisms

3871
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:27,840
all right so back to how you are

3872
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:29,579
mechanically uh breaking up and

3873
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:32,340
stripping your soil we've got the first

3874
02:43:29,579 --> 02:43:34,739
one which is your soft colliding washing

3875
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:37,079
machine what's another one

3876
02:43:34,739 --> 02:43:39,719
okay so soft colliding

3877
02:43:37,079 --> 02:43:41,939
um aeration dissolved oxygen in the

3878
02:43:39,719 --> 02:43:43,739
water again adding those other elements

3879
02:43:41,939 --> 02:43:46,380
because every time that bubble comes up

3880
02:43:43,739 --> 02:43:48,420
it pushing something out of the way and

3881
02:43:46,379 --> 02:43:50,639
displacing and putting it back into

3882
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:53,898
mechanical uh

3883
02:43:50,639 --> 02:43:58,439
back into a mechanical force position

3884
02:43:53,898 --> 02:44:00,539
so then after you go through uh those

3885
02:43:58,439 --> 02:44:03,600
basic or I want to call beginning

3886
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:06,600
processes of of pulling apart the

3887
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:09,780
organic matter the next would be uh

3888
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:11,340
through dewatering so by dewatering

3889
02:44:09,780 --> 02:44:13,560
there's a couple of different ways to do

3890
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:15,840
it um there are some really cool screw

3891
02:44:13,559 --> 02:44:17,459
presses where you'd feed in this slurry

3892
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:19,500
at the top of it

3893
02:44:17,459 --> 02:44:22,799
and it has a big auger in it and it

3894
02:44:19,500 --> 02:44:25,559
presses that material until the liquid

3895
02:44:22,799 --> 02:44:27,659
oozes out the sides and eventually you

3896
02:44:25,559 --> 02:44:30,299
just get this cake that comes out the

3897
02:44:27,659 --> 02:44:33,299
end where where when the screw pressure

3898
02:44:30,299 --> 02:44:35,340
has gotten so great that the end of it

3899
02:44:33,299 --> 02:44:38,398
will kind of open up a little bit and

3900
02:44:35,340 --> 02:44:42,439
let let some of the dewatered organic

3901
02:44:38,398 --> 02:44:46,079
matter to spill out into the waste pan

3902
02:44:42,439 --> 02:44:49,680
I've also used uh personally I've I've

3903
02:44:46,079 --> 02:44:53,340
went toward what's called a concrete

3904
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:55,920
vibrator it's used to mount on the walls

3905
02:44:53,340 --> 02:44:58,200
of Foundations so that you're vibrating

3906
02:44:55,920 --> 02:45:01,978
the concrete to get all of the air out

3907
02:44:58,200 --> 02:45:06,859
of it and I use that in conjunction with

3908
02:45:01,978 --> 02:45:10,500
a metal or wood frame and with a

3909
02:45:06,859 --> 02:45:11,659
stainless steel mesh screen did I String

3910
02:45:10,500 --> 02:45:14,639
like a guitar

3911
02:45:11,659 --> 02:45:17,520
and then I suspended on these rubber

3912
02:45:14,639 --> 02:45:19,199
isolators so that the vibration is only

3913
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:21,359
occurring on the screen and not

3914
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:24,240
vibrating everything else around it so

3915
02:45:21,359 --> 02:45:27,120
I've basically isolated the vibration

3916
02:45:24,239 --> 02:45:29,520
and when I hit the certain if you do

3917
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:31,140
this you get the variable speed and you

3918
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:33,180
turn it up or down and you'll get this

3919
02:45:31,139 --> 02:45:35,039
point where it's called resonance

3920
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:38,220
when everything is vibrating and the

3921
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:40,020
liquid just pours out of it if you're if

3922
02:45:38,219 --> 02:45:41,760
you're not right what's going to happen

3923
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:43,079
is the top is going to start vibrating

3924
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:46,200
and you're going to see all this air

3925
02:45:43,079 --> 02:45:48,059
bubbles and stuff coming up but when you

3926
02:45:46,200 --> 02:45:51,420
hit that sweet spot that resonance

3927
02:45:48,059 --> 02:45:53,159
you're not seeing any surface action on

3928
02:45:51,420 --> 02:45:55,879
the top but you're just hearing the

3929
02:45:53,159 --> 02:45:58,520
water pouring out of the bottom

3930
02:45:55,879 --> 02:46:01,799
that has a couple of different

3931
02:45:58,520 --> 02:46:04,500
advantages first of all yes you're

3932
02:46:01,799 --> 02:46:07,019
getting the maximum amount of liquid out

3933
02:46:04,500 --> 02:46:09,859
of that organic matter that is otherwise

3934
02:46:07,020 --> 02:46:14,159
over saturated

3935
02:46:09,859 --> 02:46:16,559
but through vibration

3936
02:46:14,159 --> 02:46:18,959
your exciting electrons and this gets

3937
02:46:16,559 --> 02:46:22,079
really [ __ ] deep but excited

3938
02:46:18,959 --> 02:46:23,219
electrons tend to want to interact with

3939
02:46:22,079 --> 02:46:26,039
each other

3940
02:46:23,219 --> 02:46:29,159
um they want to hold they want to bond

3941
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:32,520
so one of the most interesting phenomena

3942
02:46:29,159 --> 02:46:36,239
that's behind this process is that I

3943
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:38,399
noticed after I've vibrated it

3944
02:46:36,239 --> 02:46:40,439
and say I want to sift out some

3945
02:46:38,398 --> 02:46:42,539
rejuvenate or some Alliance which is one

3946
02:46:40,439 --> 02:46:43,579
of the two products the solid products

3947
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:46,560
that I make

3948
02:46:43,579 --> 02:46:49,079
I will see you know the liquid goes

3949
02:46:46,559 --> 02:46:50,039
through and then the clumps on the

3950
02:46:49,079 --> 02:46:52,859
surface

3951
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:55,140
start to clod they start to attach they

3952
02:46:52,859 --> 02:46:59,520
start to form micro Aggregates almost

3953
02:46:55,139 --> 02:47:01,858
immediately it's it's crazy Shango

3954
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:04,200
um and I've noticed too that when I take

3955
02:47:01,859 --> 02:47:07,559
it to the next level and and you know

3956
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:09,359
stabilize or completely dewater the

3957
02:47:07,559 --> 02:47:12,299
alliance or the rejuvenate

3958
02:47:09,359 --> 02:47:14,479
um I basically put it in a giant press a

3959
02:47:12,299 --> 02:47:17,759
screw press and I just keep cranking it

3960
02:47:14,478 --> 02:47:20,818
until I squeeze out what is literally

3961
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:23,700
pure folic acid

3962
02:47:20,818 --> 02:47:26,398
um I then take that cake

3963
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:29,399
and I again run it through a vibrating

3964
02:47:26,398 --> 02:47:31,379
screen to create that soft fluffy stuff

3965
02:47:29,398 --> 02:47:36,239
that you talked about earlier in the

3966
02:47:31,379 --> 02:47:39,358
show when you put that stuff on soil

3967
02:47:36,239 --> 02:47:42,059
oh my God automatically clay platelets

3968
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:43,439
sand particles they just start to bond

3969
02:47:42,059 --> 02:47:46,260
together and create these

3970
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:49,920
microaggregates I can only explain it

3971
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:53,239
through my understanding of of quantum

3972
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:56,460
mechanics that when you stimulate

3973
02:47:53,239 --> 02:47:59,600
electrons and and protons

3974
02:47:56,459 --> 02:48:02,339
um that you can actually create these uh

3975
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:05,460
paramagnetic charges

3976
02:48:02,340 --> 02:48:08,939
um that begin to want to attract or

3977
02:48:05,459 --> 02:48:10,858
repel based on their charge

3978
02:48:08,939 --> 02:48:12,359
I know that was a deep one no no makes

3979
02:48:10,859 --> 02:48:14,780
sense though so I've got five of these

3980
02:48:12,359 --> 02:48:18,318
so far soft gliding washing machine

3981
02:48:14,780 --> 02:48:21,060
aeration bubbles dewatering press

3982
02:48:18,318 --> 02:48:23,879
concrete vibrator and then a vibrating

3983
02:48:21,059 --> 02:48:25,680
screen what else what else is that it is

3984
02:48:23,879 --> 02:48:27,959
another one I would say that's the

3985
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:32,159
majority of it I mean again

3986
02:48:27,959 --> 02:48:35,099
um your goal here is to lower the

3987
02:48:32,159 --> 02:48:38,219
moisture value of the product if you're

3988
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:40,620
trying to make it shelf stable if if if

3989
02:48:38,219 --> 02:48:42,779
shelf stability isn't an issue and you

3990
02:48:40,620 --> 02:48:45,240
just want to make it and use it then you

3991
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:47,100
don't have to go through um all of these

3992
02:48:45,239 --> 02:48:50,100
processes like you you can just like

3993
02:48:47,100 --> 02:48:51,840
literally like just take it mix it I

3994
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:54,000
poured it into a paint strainer which

3995
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:56,398
was stupid I should have used a insect

3996
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:57,840
screen because in turn we're only

3997
02:48:56,398 --> 02:48:59,879
putting it in a watering can and

3998
02:48:57,840 --> 02:49:01,920
watering it so I don't need to take all

3999
02:48:59,879 --> 02:49:04,739
the big chunks out of it

4000
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:07,620
um the the more chunky it is

4001
02:49:04,739 --> 02:49:10,318
um the better and higher level of

4002
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:12,840
inoculation that you can create uh

4003
02:49:10,318 --> 02:49:14,939
quicker so again the chunkier the better

4004
02:49:12,840 --> 02:49:16,920
so I think those are pretty much the

4005
02:49:14,939 --> 02:49:18,600
primary forces and then it's just a

4006
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:21,059
matter of all right how are you applying

4007
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:22,979
it okay and that'll that'll drive you to

4008
02:49:21,059 --> 02:49:24,420
all right I got how to screen it to this

4009
02:49:22,978 --> 02:49:26,219
level because I'm running it through a

4010
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:28,920
diaphragm pump please do not use

4011
02:49:26,219 --> 02:49:31,079
centrifugal force centrifugal force

4012
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:34,260
creates cavitation cavitation kills

4013
02:49:31,079 --> 02:49:36,420
biology so you don't want to have any

4014
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:38,180
kind of uh

4015
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:41,180
mechanical

4016
02:49:38,180 --> 02:49:44,340
pumps that that will create cavitation

4017
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:46,439
or centrifugal force you want to use a

4018
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:48,478
diaphragm pump so if you are using a

4019
02:49:46,439 --> 02:49:50,220
diaphragm pump and you've got spray rig

4020
02:49:48,478 --> 02:49:53,519
or nozzles that you've got to deal with

4021
02:49:50,219 --> 02:49:55,559
then you have to screen to that level to

4022
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:58,079
get it out there in the field so I want

4023
02:49:55,559 --> 02:50:01,340
to I want to take a pause here and and

4024
02:49:58,079 --> 02:50:03,898
like for people who possibly like me

4025
02:50:01,340 --> 02:50:05,340
these last five steps that you have

4026
02:50:03,898 --> 02:50:07,379
mentioned

4027
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:09,420
um were are very

4028
02:50:07,379 --> 02:50:12,059
um off-putting right because like I'm

4029
02:50:09,420 --> 02:50:14,040
not I I wouldn't do this stuff right and

4030
02:50:12,059 --> 02:50:16,978
and I think it's important to to point

4031
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:22,500
out that the the point of the show was

4032
02:50:16,978 --> 02:50:26,059
to encourage folks to make a cold

4033
02:50:22,500 --> 02:50:29,700
um a cold compost which is essentially a

4034
02:50:26,059 --> 02:50:32,519
organic material microbinocular and you

4035
02:50:29,700 --> 02:50:36,060
don't have to do this last part all you

4036
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:37,560
needed to do was just not ha you know

4037
02:50:36,059 --> 02:50:40,920
put the care

4038
02:50:37,559 --> 02:50:44,398
into collecting your plants and then not

4039
02:50:40,920 --> 02:50:46,739
let the pile get too hot

4040
02:50:44,398 --> 02:50:48,840
um like that's that's it that that's the

4041
02:50:46,739 --> 02:50:51,898
whole point of what we're encouraging

4042
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:54,059
folks to make and but but to do it right

4043
02:50:51,898 --> 02:50:56,159
you need to do things like you know make

4044
02:50:54,059 --> 02:50:59,100
sure you avoid your pathogens by using

4045
02:50:56,159 --> 02:51:01,200
plant material only and make sure it

4046
02:50:59,100 --> 02:51:02,520
doesn't get too hot and then like the

4047
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:03,500
stuff that we talked about during set

4048
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:05,819
two

4049
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:06,898
these things that we're talking about

4050
02:51:05,818 --> 02:51:10,559
now

4051
02:51:06,898 --> 02:51:12,239
uh number one they remove the water to

4052
02:51:10,559 --> 02:51:15,659
make your final

4053
02:51:12,239 --> 02:51:19,020
um material shelf stable but also by

4054
02:51:15,659 --> 02:51:23,039
breaking it up it creates

4055
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:25,979
um lots of places for microbe life to

4056
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:28,560
attach to the soil like it means that

4057
02:51:25,978 --> 02:51:31,459
the the the compost will be quickly

4058
02:51:28,559 --> 02:51:33,779
integrated into wherever you place it

4059
02:51:31,459 --> 02:51:37,739
and also

4060
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:39,780
um increases the places for Community

4061
02:51:37,739 --> 02:51:43,199
right because there's all these like 360

4062
02:51:39,780 --> 02:51:45,720
degree ridges everywhere but but but if

4063
02:51:43,200 --> 02:51:47,659
if we lost you here at the beginning of

4064
02:51:45,719 --> 02:51:49,920
set three with this mechanical stuff

4065
02:51:47,659 --> 02:51:52,260
don't lose heart because you don't you

4066
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:54,779
don't have to do this part this is this

4067
02:51:52,260 --> 02:51:58,260
is really just a way to finish it

4068
02:51:54,779 --> 02:51:59,760
if you need to you know make it stable

4069
02:51:58,260 --> 02:52:01,260
where you're gonna you know make it once

4070
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:03,960
a year and then let it sit all year

4071
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:05,818
right you don't have to do this no you

4072
02:52:03,959 --> 02:52:08,699
don't have to do this but the reason

4073
02:52:05,818 --> 02:52:10,978
that this is important to understand is

4074
02:52:08,700 --> 02:52:13,200
all about delivery

4075
02:52:10,978 --> 02:52:15,959
so we've grown these organisms we've

4076
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:19,079
we've done the work we've made this

4077
02:52:15,959 --> 02:52:22,619
beautiful biologically Rich compost how

4078
02:52:19,079 --> 02:52:25,859
do we get that biology into the soil

4079
02:52:22,620 --> 02:52:28,260
um effectively and efficiently the only

4080
02:52:25,859 --> 02:52:29,880
way to do that is with liquid because

4081
02:52:28,260 --> 02:52:32,639
the liquid will help move those

4082
02:52:29,879 --> 02:52:34,559
organisms down into the soil profile you

4083
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:37,760
take your compost this amazing stuff

4084
02:52:34,559 --> 02:52:39,840
that you made and you top dress well

4085
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:42,960
fifty percent of it's going to get

4086
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:45,840
oxidated and die or exposed to UV and

4087
02:52:42,959 --> 02:52:48,659
die so how effective did you get those

4088
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:50,818
microorganisms down into the soil not

4089
02:52:48,659 --> 02:52:52,439
very effectively you lost 50 percent of

4090
02:52:50,818 --> 02:52:54,000
them so you're actually making two

4091
02:52:52,439 --> 02:52:58,200
products here

4092
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:59,779
um the the one product is the actual low

4093
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:02,460
moisture

4094
02:52:59,779 --> 02:53:04,680
inoculated compost that even though you

4095
02:53:02,459 --> 02:53:07,500
know you've removed most of the water it

4096
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:09,479
is still brimming with life and and it's

4097
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:12,299
essentially a dry good that you can sell

4098
02:53:09,478 --> 02:53:16,019
in a bag but then there is a secondary

4099
02:53:12,299 --> 02:53:18,239
product or useful product which is the

4100
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:21,020
the water that keeps on coming out of

4101
02:53:18,239 --> 02:53:25,199
this stuff which is just also brimming

4102
02:53:21,020 --> 02:53:26,399
with life and and that you're you know

4103
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:27,840
we don't care about it being shelf

4104
02:53:26,398 --> 02:53:30,539
stable you're just going to pour that on

4105
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:33,779
your plants right and that's the key

4106
02:53:30,540 --> 02:53:36,660
again is delivery so how do we get these

4107
02:53:33,779 --> 02:53:38,279
microorganisms uh into a condominium

4108
02:53:36,659 --> 02:53:39,898
where they have food water and cover and

4109
02:53:38,279 --> 02:53:42,120
then how do we get them down into the

4110
02:53:39,898 --> 02:53:44,398
soil profile where they're going to be

4111
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:47,760
safe and sound and and continue to grow

4112
02:53:44,398 --> 02:53:48,959
to inoculate so the the the other

4113
02:53:47,760 --> 02:53:50,040
product that we're talking about is

4114
02:53:48,959 --> 02:53:52,619
harmonize

4115
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:56,040
um highly unstable like if you leave

4116
02:53:52,620 --> 02:53:57,779
this in a bucket for a day maybe two

4117
02:53:56,040 --> 02:53:59,880
you're talking about the water right

4118
02:53:57,779 --> 02:54:02,220
yeah the liquid um it's going to go

4119
02:53:59,879 --> 02:54:05,659
anaerobic because there's just so much

4120
02:54:02,219 --> 02:54:09,420
what's called biological oxygen demand

4121
02:54:05,659 --> 02:54:11,520
bod because there's so much at going on

4122
02:54:09,420 --> 02:54:13,500
in activity they're stripping the

4123
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:16,680
dissolved oxygen out of that water at

4124
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:19,439
such a fast rate that it it can't

4125
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:22,318
survive and if it goes anaerobic well

4126
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:25,340
now I've defeated my whole purpose my

4127
02:54:22,318 --> 02:54:29,340
purpose was to get

4128
02:54:25,340 --> 02:54:31,680
minerals nutrients biology into the soil

4129
02:54:29,340 --> 02:54:33,840
so that it could do its work and it was

4130
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:36,659
no longer Mobile in other words if it

4131
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:39,299
rained it didn't wash away but if I go

4132
02:54:36,659 --> 02:54:42,478
anaerobic I've basically made a nutrient

4133
02:54:39,299 --> 02:54:44,278
solution that's all the plant needs

4134
02:54:42,478 --> 02:54:45,599
right there in that liquid even though

4135
02:54:44,279 --> 02:54:47,819
it smells like hell

4136
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:49,200
if I pour it on that plant the plant's

4137
02:54:47,818 --> 02:54:52,019
going to be able to take it up really

4138
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:54,540
quickly but if it rains or I water I've

4139
02:54:52,020 --> 02:54:56,880
washed it all out of the profile so I

4140
02:54:54,540 --> 02:55:01,020
think that's the real missing piece is

4141
02:54:56,879 --> 02:55:03,179
mobile or not mobile what am I producing

4142
02:55:01,020 --> 02:55:06,960
and my goal was always to produce

4143
02:55:03,180 --> 02:55:10,318
non-mobile nutrients that in the form of

4144
02:55:06,959 --> 02:55:13,019
biology that could be there for as a

4145
02:55:10,318 --> 02:55:14,100
nutrient bank for forever for thousands

4146
02:55:13,020 --> 02:55:17,640
of years

4147
02:55:14,100 --> 02:55:19,559
so that's again the mechanical side of

4148
02:55:17,639 --> 02:55:21,840
this is how to effectively and

4149
02:55:19,559 --> 02:55:24,778
efficiently deliver this very sensitive

4150
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:28,200
biology down into a place where it is

4151
02:55:24,779 --> 02:55:31,079
safe and it has food water and cover and

4152
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:34,200
if you are somebody like me who is very

4153
02:55:31,079 --> 02:55:37,200
interested in a cold compost but I'm not

4154
02:55:34,200 --> 02:55:41,220
going to do the mechanical aspects of

4155
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:43,740
this it is also fabulous and way better

4156
02:55:41,219 --> 02:55:48,239
than your thermal compost if you were to

4157
02:55:43,739 --> 02:55:52,139
just make this cold compost pile and

4158
02:55:48,239 --> 02:55:53,818
then make a compost tea with it and just

4159
02:55:52,139 --> 02:55:56,039
pour it on your plants and get right to

4160
02:55:53,818 --> 02:55:58,019
it that's the That's essential

4161
02:55:56,040 --> 02:56:00,479
essentially what we did we made a

4162
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:02,880
compost extract not a tea like yeah you

4163
02:56:00,478 --> 02:56:04,858
could take this biological compost throw

4164
02:56:02,879 --> 02:56:06,719
it in your Brewer whether you put it in

4165
02:56:04,859 --> 02:56:09,000
a bag or free Brew it personally I would

4166
02:56:06,719 --> 02:56:11,760
free Brew it which is basically just

4167
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:14,040
throw handfuls in there bubble it for uh

4168
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:16,318
30 hours again we need to touch base on

4169
02:56:14,040 --> 02:56:17,060
that why that's such a critical point in

4170
02:56:16,318 --> 02:56:20,579
time

4171
02:56:17,059 --> 02:56:22,619
but now I've made a compost Brew so I've

4172
02:56:20,579 --> 02:56:24,600
taken a handful of this compost that I

4173
02:56:22,620 --> 02:56:27,060
made the cold compost threw in a little

4174
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:28,939
bit of sugars again it's uh you want to

4175
02:56:27,059 --> 02:56:32,639
make sure you're using

4176
02:56:28,939 --> 02:56:35,639
unsulfured black strap molasses no more

4177
02:56:32,639 --> 02:56:37,978
than one ounce per 20 gallons if you do

4178
02:56:35,639 --> 02:56:41,278
use more you're going to raise the

4179
02:56:37,978 --> 02:56:43,978
biological oxygen demand bod and you're

4180
02:56:41,279 --> 02:56:45,840
going to have an anaerobic [ __ ] show so

4181
02:56:43,978 --> 02:56:47,219
you've got a very very little bit of

4182
02:56:45,840 --> 02:56:50,040
foods

4183
02:56:47,219 --> 02:56:53,579
bubble it for 30 hours and then use it

4184
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:56,580
up by hour 36. the reason being is that

4185
02:56:53,579 --> 02:56:59,159
between hour 20 and hour 24 is when you

4186
02:56:56,579 --> 02:57:01,020
start to get your high level of protozoa

4187
02:56:59,159 --> 02:57:02,700
and production in other words you've

4188
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:05,159
provided the bacteria you provided the

4189
02:57:02,700 --> 02:57:06,840
deer now all of a sudden the Lions the

4190
02:57:05,159 --> 02:57:08,100
Bears and the wolves are coming in and

4191
02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:11,100
they're breeding like crazy because

4192
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:12,960
there's so much food in the source and

4193
02:57:11,100 --> 02:57:15,779
that's why it's critical that you wait

4194
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:18,539
till hour 30 so that you've had a good

4195
02:57:15,779 --> 02:57:21,120
six to eight hours of high level of

4196
02:57:18,540 --> 02:57:23,460
protozoan production because at the end

4197
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:26,520
of the day everybody's missing the

4198
02:57:23,459 --> 02:57:29,099
protozoa it's all about the protozoa we

4199
02:57:26,520 --> 02:57:32,520
all have bacterially dominant soils

4200
02:57:29,100 --> 02:57:33,840
so what is the missing piece protozoa

4201
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:35,520
they're the ones that are eating the

4202
02:57:33,840 --> 02:57:36,719
bacteria and releasing that plant

4203
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:39,479
available

4204
02:57:36,719 --> 02:57:42,778
so the other point is that yeah if you

4205
02:57:39,478 --> 02:57:44,818
just took this uh this cold compost and

4206
02:57:42,779 --> 02:57:46,920
you threw it in some water and agitated

4207
02:57:44,818 --> 02:57:49,439
it with your hands and then poured it on

4208
02:57:46,920 --> 02:57:51,960
your plants now you've basically made a

4209
02:57:49,439 --> 02:57:53,700
compost extract with it so do you need

4210
02:57:51,959 --> 02:57:56,159
the mechanical stuff no you can use your

4211
02:57:53,700 --> 02:57:57,840
hands but if you're gonna take the time

4212
02:57:56,159 --> 02:57:59,639
to actually massage it with your hands

4213
02:57:57,840 --> 02:58:01,460
for a period of time wouldn't it be

4214
02:57:59,639 --> 02:58:05,159
easier to use a power drill

4215
02:58:01,459 --> 02:58:07,139
you know so yeah no it's going to say

4216
02:58:05,159 --> 02:58:08,879
it's it's all about delivery how are you

4217
02:58:07,139 --> 02:58:11,278
getting those organisms into the soil

4218
02:58:08,879 --> 02:58:13,679
the most effective and efficient way and

4219
02:58:11,279 --> 02:58:18,479
I think the key to this is go ahead and

4220
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:20,100
make your cold compost pile and once you

4221
02:58:18,478 --> 02:58:22,438
have that there's a whole bunch of

4222
02:58:20,100 --> 02:58:25,260
different ways that you can apply it but

4223
02:58:22,439 --> 02:58:28,200
but we're encouraging you to make the

4224
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:30,540
pile and don't overheat it and once you

4225
02:58:28,200 --> 02:58:32,579
have that you can do it the easy way

4226
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:34,920
which is how I will be doing it which is

4227
02:58:32,579 --> 02:58:37,079
to take a you know a few handfuls and

4228
02:58:34,920 --> 02:58:39,059
bubble it up for 30 hours and put it on

4229
02:58:37,079 --> 02:58:41,100
your plants you want to take that

4230
02:58:39,059 --> 02:58:43,318
further because you know maybe you're

4231
02:58:41,100 --> 02:58:46,079
scaled and you want this to be available

4232
02:58:43,318 --> 02:58:47,398
to you in a few months well then go

4233
02:58:46,079 --> 02:58:50,520
through more of the mechanical stuff

4234
02:58:47,398 --> 02:58:53,099
press out the water and then you can you

4235
02:58:50,520 --> 02:58:55,140
can put that um that compost on the

4236
02:58:53,100 --> 02:58:56,818
shelf and it will be ready for you when

4237
02:58:55,139 --> 02:58:59,818
you need to use it in a few months and

4238
02:58:56,818 --> 02:59:02,459
you can use that water now so

4239
02:58:59,818 --> 02:59:05,340
um but but really it's all about getting

4240
02:59:02,459 --> 02:59:07,079
getting that pile made and not having

4241
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:09,239
the pile get hot

4242
02:59:07,079 --> 02:59:11,818
I'm into that dude all right it's all

4243
02:59:09,239 --> 02:59:13,379
about making ingredients one interesting

4244
02:59:11,818 --> 02:59:16,619
uh footnote I would like to throw in

4245
02:59:13,379 --> 02:59:19,978
here is that people will be astonished

4246
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:22,800
at all the unexpected benefits that come

4247
02:59:19,978 --> 02:59:27,539
from using a

4248
02:59:22,799 --> 02:59:29,579
um a biology Rich cold compost and the

4249
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:31,620
one example that I want to have because

4250
02:59:29,579 --> 02:59:34,559
it's really hard to say oh my plant's

4251
02:59:31,620 --> 02:59:37,079
color got so much better and and oh like

4252
02:59:34,559 --> 02:59:39,420
look like the the flowers were so good

4253
02:59:37,079 --> 02:59:41,639
and oh my gosh the flowers tasted better

4254
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:43,439
I felt like it had a wider terpene

4255
02:59:41,639 --> 02:59:45,920
profile than I normally get all that's

4256
02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:49,739
true but it's really hard to to to

4257
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:51,779
measure that but what I can tell you is

4258
02:59:49,739 --> 02:59:53,639
if you go back in the in the shaping

4259
02:59:51,779 --> 02:59:57,960
fire Instagram you know we've got these

4260
02:59:53,639 --> 02:59:59,519
this four by four indoor bed that um you

4261
02:59:57,959 --> 03:00:01,858
know even though I'm using electricity

4262
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:04,680
for LED lights I'm trying to use

4263
03:00:01,859 --> 03:00:06,359
regenerative techniques indoors uh it

4264
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:08,159
kind of has an experiment

4265
03:00:06,359 --> 03:00:10,079
um because you know doing region

4266
03:00:08,159 --> 03:00:13,079
regenerative stuff indoors has got its

4267
03:00:10,079 --> 03:00:16,200
own challenges and so I I did that and

4268
03:00:13,079 --> 03:00:19,680
um I ended up with a fungus gnat

4269
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:22,079
breakout for whatever reason and um and

4270
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:24,120
I'm like you know I'm talking with my

4271
03:00:22,079 --> 03:00:25,739
providers about the beneficial insects I

4272
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:27,479
want and all this kind of stuff and and

4273
03:00:25,739 --> 03:00:29,100
I call you to [ __ ] because we're

4274
03:00:27,478 --> 03:00:30,778
friends and we do that and I'm like I

4275
03:00:29,100 --> 03:00:36,779
got this situation and you're like oh

4276
03:00:30,779 --> 03:00:40,200
let me send you up this cold compost

4277
03:00:36,779 --> 03:00:42,359
um that I've made and then bubble it up

4278
03:00:40,200 --> 03:00:44,760
and pour it on your bed and I'm like I

4279
03:00:42,359 --> 03:00:48,720
don't know I don't understand how a you

4280
03:00:44,760 --> 03:00:50,639
know a freaking compost tea is going to

4281
03:00:48,719 --> 03:00:52,619
um you know get rid of my gnats if

4282
03:00:50,639 --> 03:00:54,478
anything it's going to make the soil

4283
03:00:52,620 --> 03:00:56,040
more wet and I'm going to get more

4284
03:00:54,478 --> 03:00:58,079
fungus gnats and you're like well first

4285
03:00:56,040 --> 03:01:00,660
of all it's not a tea it's an extract

4286
03:00:58,079 --> 03:01:02,459
I'm like oh all right and uh and and

4287
03:01:00,659 --> 03:01:04,379
then but then you said you said just do

4288
03:01:02,459 --> 03:01:06,119
it and I'm like all right well I trust

4289
03:01:04,379 --> 03:01:08,219
you enough I just you know very often I

4290
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:10,079
will just do the stuff you say and and

4291
03:01:08,219 --> 03:01:11,879
then watch for the benefit and then and

4292
03:01:10,079 --> 03:01:15,600
so that's what I did and I'll be damned

4293
03:01:11,879 --> 03:01:19,579
it was like I I I made this and I put

4294
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:22,020
the five gallons of it um first I I I

4295
03:01:19,579 --> 03:01:23,818
sprayed it on the top so I made sure

4296
03:01:22,020 --> 03:01:26,239
that I got all the top areas but then I

4297
03:01:23,818 --> 03:01:27,959
just kind of like poured the rest in

4298
03:01:26,239 --> 03:01:31,680
and

4299
03:01:27,959 --> 03:01:35,699
um you know I was I had no fungus gnats

4300
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:37,439
within 48 hours I was flabbergasted and

4301
03:01:35,700 --> 03:01:39,899
I called you and I'm all like what kind

4302
03:01:37,439 --> 03:01:42,500
of sorcery is this and and how did you

4303
03:01:39,898 --> 03:01:46,039
explain it to me

4304
03:01:42,500 --> 03:01:46,040
it is sorcery

4305
03:01:46,559 --> 03:01:52,379
um basically what you did was you threw

4306
03:01:48,719 --> 03:01:55,500
down a bunch of hungry microbes uh and

4307
03:01:52,379 --> 03:01:57,898
with a food source of of fungal larvae

4308
03:01:55,500 --> 03:02:00,600
uh fungal Nat larvae all over the place

4309
03:01:57,898 --> 03:02:02,159
so they just went to town it was like

4310
03:02:00,600 --> 03:02:05,220
buffet time

4311
03:02:02,159 --> 03:02:08,039
so yeah so so the the Predators

4312
03:02:05,219 --> 03:02:10,858
essentially that were in this highly

4313
03:02:08,040 --> 03:02:13,560
inoculated extract they went and they

4314
03:02:10,859 --> 03:02:16,020
ate all the larval of the of the fungus

4315
03:02:13,559 --> 03:02:18,119
gnats and like I never even considered

4316
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:20,939
that approach to fungus gnats and it

4317
03:02:18,120 --> 03:02:24,000
worked nearly instantly and was like you

4318
03:02:20,939 --> 03:02:26,340
know very economical to do

4319
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:29,459
um but that is just an example I want to

4320
03:02:26,340 --> 03:02:31,079
give folks for you know once you start I

4321
03:02:29,459 --> 03:02:32,938
mean we all love the microbes right and

4322
03:02:31,079 --> 03:02:36,120
we all believe in IMO and we all believe

4323
03:02:32,939 --> 03:02:38,460
in using nature as our Ally but this is

4324
03:02:36,120 --> 03:02:41,939
kind of next level

4325
03:02:38,459 --> 03:02:45,179
um and I encourage folks to to to do it

4326
03:02:41,939 --> 03:02:47,100
so all right so uh in in bringing us

4327
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:49,318
kind of like to a close here Leighton

4328
03:02:47,100 --> 03:02:53,340
you know we we talked about

4329
03:02:49,318 --> 03:02:55,559
you know what kinds of compost or things

4330
03:02:53,340 --> 03:02:57,120
that are called compost are available to

4331
03:02:55,559 --> 03:02:59,879
us and and we talked about what those

4332
03:02:57,120 --> 03:03:02,520
options were like and and and some of

4333
03:02:59,879 --> 03:03:04,259
them like Verma Verma culture compost we

4334
03:03:02,520 --> 03:03:07,260
freaking love and and some of it like

4335
03:03:04,260 --> 03:03:10,620
the bag stuff we don't really love

4336
03:03:07,260 --> 03:03:12,659
um but but the one thing was that we

4337
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:15,060
wanted to encourage folks to not heat

4338
03:03:12,659 --> 03:03:17,459
their piles and so so people go ahead

4339
03:03:15,059 --> 03:03:21,539
and they they they they don't Heat their

4340
03:03:17,459 --> 03:03:24,539
piles they're using clean non-pathogenic

4341
03:03:21,540 --> 03:03:26,100
um green materials and Browns and and

4342
03:03:24,540 --> 03:03:30,240
then they and they have this and they

4343
03:03:26,100 --> 03:03:34,380
make it and so now they've got what what

4344
03:03:30,239 --> 03:03:36,600
is going to be the nature of the pot

4345
03:03:34,379 --> 03:03:38,639
container or the soil if you're going

4346
03:03:36,600 --> 03:03:43,140
right in the ground kind of bring us

4347
03:03:38,639 --> 03:03:46,199
home here by describing the nature of

4348
03:03:43,139 --> 03:03:48,778
the soil after this application versus

4349
03:03:46,200 --> 03:03:51,000
the nature of their soil before the

4350
03:03:48,779 --> 03:03:54,359
application and and we'll end with this

4351
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:58,200
okay uh that's probably the whole point

4352
03:03:54,359 --> 03:04:00,720
of this conversation is soil aggregate

4353
03:03:58,200 --> 03:04:02,520
um that's the reason you use compost

4354
03:04:00,719 --> 03:04:06,239
um and that's the reason we use microbes

4355
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:08,340
is because they actually form

4356
03:04:06,239 --> 03:04:10,439
um aggregation and what is aggregation

4357
03:04:08,340 --> 03:04:13,380
aggregation is like a little

4358
03:04:10,439 --> 03:04:16,398
clump of sand silk clay and organic

4359
03:04:13,379 --> 03:04:20,059
matter inside that Clump is is

4360
03:04:16,398 --> 03:04:23,159
waterfalls and and ponds and cities and

4361
03:04:20,059 --> 03:04:26,359
walkways and parks and all kinds of

4362
03:04:23,159 --> 03:04:31,680
different creatures and organisms

4363
03:04:26,359 --> 03:04:33,659
considered a zoo and so inside that and

4364
03:04:31,680 --> 03:04:36,659
and it's in this article that talks

4365
03:04:33,659 --> 03:04:39,119
about the magic the the biogeochemical

4366
03:04:36,659 --> 03:04:42,539
reactions that are happening inside that

4367
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:44,040
aggregate it's we don't have tools to

4368
03:04:42,540 --> 03:04:47,399
measure this yet we don't have the

4369
03:04:44,040 --> 03:04:48,420
technology to test it or monitor it or

4370
03:04:47,398 --> 03:04:51,719
actually

4371
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:53,760
scope it in situ there is a new

4372
03:04:51,719 --> 03:04:56,219
instrument that was invented I believe

4373
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:57,719
last year that is a microscope that you

4374
03:04:56,219 --> 03:04:59,818
push into the soil

4375
03:04:57,719 --> 03:05:02,760
and you can leave it there for for days

4376
03:04:59,818 --> 03:05:04,379
weeks and monitor this [ __ ] those are

4377
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:06,600
the kinds of tools that we're going to

4378
03:05:04,379 --> 03:05:10,139
need to really Advance our understanding

4379
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:12,540
on how valuable soil Aggregates are and

4380
03:05:10,139 --> 03:05:16,379
Aggregates are a combination of fungi

4381
03:05:12,540 --> 03:05:19,200
bacteria protozoa the physical side of

4382
03:05:16,379 --> 03:05:22,259
it as well as the chemical side of it it

4383
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:24,779
is the is the is the triple threat it's

4384
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:27,420
the physical the chemical and and the

4385
03:05:24,779 --> 03:05:29,300
biological coming together and that's

4386
03:05:27,420 --> 03:05:32,340
why the Aggregates are so important

4387
03:05:29,299 --> 03:05:36,420
again Aggregates let the oxygen down

4388
03:05:32,340 --> 03:05:40,680
lets the CO2 out back up to the plants

4389
03:05:36,420 --> 03:05:43,978
it holds water it allows water to

4390
03:05:40,680 --> 03:05:46,559
infiltrate into the soil so it's not

4391
03:05:43,978 --> 03:05:49,438
just running off and creating erosion so

4392
03:05:46,559 --> 03:05:52,619
aggregation is is the critical

4393
03:05:49,439 --> 03:05:55,979
Foundation to soil Health you can't have

4394
03:05:52,620 --> 03:05:57,300
Aggregates without good biology it

4395
03:05:55,978 --> 03:05:59,278
doesn't exist you have you have

4396
03:05:57,299 --> 03:06:01,379
compacted soil because you don't have

4397
03:05:59,279 --> 03:06:04,079
the biology but once you have the

4398
03:06:01,379 --> 03:06:06,839
biology and the organic matter in play

4399
03:06:04,079 --> 03:06:08,579
you will begin to form Aggregates so

4400
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:10,620
again that's why I went through this

4401
03:06:08,579 --> 03:06:11,659
whole process of vibrating [ __ ] and

4402
03:06:10,620 --> 03:06:14,760
elect

4403
03:06:11,659 --> 03:06:16,739
exciting the electrons so they will form

4404
03:06:14,760 --> 03:06:19,380
these Aggregates extremely quickly

4405
03:06:16,739 --> 03:06:23,699
that's the whole purpose of taking this

4406
03:06:19,379 --> 03:06:26,159
biological compost and uh manufacturing

4407
03:06:23,700 --> 03:06:29,220
it for lack of better words

4408
03:06:26,159 --> 03:06:33,719
um so that you're getting a faster

4409
03:06:29,219 --> 03:06:36,000
response in in building the soil health

4410
03:06:33,719 --> 03:06:40,079
and building those aggregates

4411
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:41,818
fabulous so you know it's not lost on me

4412
03:06:40,079 --> 03:06:44,818
and I I think this is one of the reasons

4413
03:06:41,818 --> 03:06:47,340
why as I learned more about cold compost

4414
03:06:44,818 --> 03:06:49,680
extracts why I kept on pursuing this

4415
03:06:47,340 --> 03:06:52,079
until I figured out what this was enough

4416
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:55,318
to do a show about it I really think

4417
03:06:52,079 --> 03:06:59,039
that this is the future of regenerative

4418
03:06:55,318 --> 03:07:02,519
farming I think that you know thermal

4419
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:05,760
compost has been a great tool for the

4420
03:07:02,520 --> 03:07:09,060
times but we are sophisticated enough

4421
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:12,059
now to know how to work with the

4422
03:07:09,059 --> 03:07:15,180
microbes and to know that you know our

4423
03:07:12,059 --> 03:07:17,840
biggest role is to a stop [ __ ]

4424
03:07:15,180 --> 03:07:21,720
killing all the microbes and then second

4425
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:24,239
you know add microbes and help them help

4426
03:07:21,719 --> 03:07:26,760
incubate them and make more of them as

4427
03:07:24,239 --> 03:07:28,260
much as possible because we're not

4428
03:07:26,760 --> 03:07:30,359
really the ones that are going to clean

4429
03:07:28,260 --> 03:07:33,659
up the mess we've made it's really the

4430
03:07:30,359 --> 03:07:35,939
microbes that are and so if we are

4431
03:07:33,659 --> 03:07:37,559
dedicating ourselves to not only working

4432
03:07:35,939 --> 03:07:42,000
Within

4433
03:07:37,559 --> 03:07:46,379
the natural forces of the Earth but also

4434
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:48,719
to play our role to maximize them I

4435
03:07:46,379 --> 03:07:49,920
think that's the only direction that

4436
03:07:48,719 --> 03:07:53,039
makes sense

4437
03:07:49,920 --> 03:07:55,260
agreed 100 I mean we've we've learned

4438
03:07:53,040 --> 03:07:57,180
how to break [ __ ] down now we gotta

4439
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:59,159
learn to put things back together again

4440
03:07:57,180 --> 03:08:02,000
the way nature would have through

4441
03:07:59,159 --> 03:08:05,579
biomimicry and not not through

4442
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:08,100
our ego and for lack of better words I

4443
03:08:05,579 --> 03:08:11,100
think I think that is the best word man

4444
03:08:08,100 --> 03:08:12,840
Leighton thank you so much you know um I

4445
03:08:11,100 --> 03:08:14,460
always appreciate you

4446
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:16,500
um you know both our friendship and then

4447
03:08:14,459 --> 03:08:19,679
having you on the show but this was

4448
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:22,020
extra special today and um I appreciate

4449
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:25,920
you sharing these these insights some of

4450
03:08:22,020 --> 03:08:28,200
them pretty damn revolutionary and

4451
03:08:25,920 --> 03:08:30,540
um and also you know slogging through

4452
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:31,620
three hours of this I'm I'm exhausted

4453
03:08:30,540 --> 03:08:34,859
and I'm not even the one that was

4454
03:08:31,620 --> 03:08:37,560
talking so uh so thank you so much man I

4455
03:08:34,859 --> 03:08:39,000
I really appreciate you I appreciate you

4456
03:08:37,559 --> 03:08:41,459
too Shango you've been doing a lot of

4457
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:43,739
hard work for many years and you bring a

4458
03:08:41,459 --> 03:08:45,239
very important message to to the

4459
03:08:43,739 --> 03:08:47,818
community as well as the general

4460
03:08:45,239 --> 03:08:50,100
population as a whole and so it's an

4461
03:08:47,818 --> 03:08:51,778
honor it's a pleasure for me to be able

4462
03:08:50,100 --> 03:08:53,220
to share what I've learned in my

4463
03:08:51,779 --> 03:08:56,640
experiences with you and and your

4464
03:08:53,219 --> 03:08:59,639
audience so thank you right on so if you

4465
03:08:56,639 --> 03:09:02,340
want to uh follow along with uh Layton's

4466
03:08:59,639 --> 03:09:05,579
exploits there are two ways to do that

4467
03:09:02,340 --> 03:09:08,040
um the first way is uh on Instagram uh

4468
03:09:05,579 --> 03:09:10,459
you can follow his Instagram profile

4469
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:13,920
well at Kingdom

4470
03:09:10,459 --> 03:09:16,139
aquaponics LLC and I'll tell you

4471
03:09:13,920 --> 03:09:18,059
straight up like he's not a huge social

4472
03:09:16,139 --> 03:09:21,180
media guy because he's usually filthy

4473
03:09:18,059 --> 03:09:22,559
and in the field but he he does post

4474
03:09:21,180 --> 03:09:24,540
stuff to

4475
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:27,719
um the Instagram it is always

4476
03:09:24,540 --> 03:09:29,399
interesting and when he goes on tours

4477
03:09:27,719 --> 03:09:30,898
you'll find all that stuff and you know

4478
03:09:29,398 --> 03:09:31,978
if if you have some reason you want to

4479
03:09:30,898 --> 03:09:33,719
reach out

4480
03:09:31,978 --> 03:09:37,318
um he does check his Instagram messages

4481
03:09:33,719 --> 03:09:39,840
so so that's Kingdom aquaponics LLC and

4482
03:09:37,318 --> 03:09:43,199
