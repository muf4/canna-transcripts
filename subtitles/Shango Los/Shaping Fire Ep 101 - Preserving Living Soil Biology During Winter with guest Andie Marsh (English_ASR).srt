[Music]

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,439
there are lots of folks in the

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,939
regenerative cannabis Community who will

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,399
say that they have been into natural

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,739
farming their whole life and that is not

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
me it isn't that I was against Natural

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,579
farming it's just that I had never

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,099
really considered it I was a Midwest

9
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,079
City boy with a great deadhead weed

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,000
dealer and I just didn't have a need to

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,399
grow my own so I never really gave it

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,460
much thought but after I moved to San

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,738
Francisco in 1994 all of that changed

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,739
when I visited Dennis perrone's cannabis

15
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,899
Buyers Club I came in contact with epic

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,299
varieties of kind bud that totally

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,739
changed what I thought weed could be but

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,140
I really couldn't afford them in the

19
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,299
amounts that I wanted to smoke top shelf

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,280
weed is expensive I knew that if I

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,538
wanted to smoke those flavors that I was

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,679
going to have to learn how to grow them

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,679
myself

24
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,600
so I started learning about basic NPK

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,299
growing focused on the mineral and

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,160
chemical content of the soil and really

27
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,018
wasn't all that passionate about it and

28
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,118
I didn't really follow through

29
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,880
so instead of growing the fancy flowers

30
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,040
I now knew I wanted I decided to just

31
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,140
get a better job in the virtual reality

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,939
industry that allowed me a Ford to buy

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,799
that top shelf cannabis

34
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,199
everything changed though when I learned

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,320
about Elaine Ingham and her model for

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,060
cultivation called the soil food web

37
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,699
instead of being focused solely on the

38
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,519
nutrient composition of the soil Elaine

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,439
focused more on the life of the soil

40
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,140
growing cannabis went from boring

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,758
nutrient math to suddenly having a

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,680
relationship with microbes and other

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,420
life forms in the root Zone it was like

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,000
having friends in the soil who I was

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,159
getting into a relationship with and

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,618
unlike the Tamagotchi that I kept alive

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,680
at the time when I kept the microbes in

48
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:52,019
the soil alive they grew me amazing

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,180
thriving cannabis that was my kind of

50
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:57,539
relationship my new friends were

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,240
nematodes worms arthropods and fungi and

52
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,219
we shared the same goals

53
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,658
if you want to learn about cannabis

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,519

you are listening to shaping fire and I

82
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:03,238
am your host shangolos

83
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,180
my guest today is soil biologist Andy

84
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,920
Marsh Andy is a soil Health practitioner

85
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,140
and focuses her efforts on soil

86
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,179
restoration through her business rhizos

87
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,639
LLC based in Texas

88
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,980
she studied bio-environmental science at

89
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,719
Texas A M focusing largely on

90
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,280
agricultural microbiology and

91
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,620
bioremediation

92
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,959
Andy has studied the soil food web with

93
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,539
Elaine Ingham and is a certified soil

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,219
food web lab technician that means that

95
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,318
Andy has completed all of Elaine's

96
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,539
foundational soil food web courses and

97
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,238
has gone further to earn a soil food web

98
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,739
certification in microscopy soon she

99
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,719
will also have her soil food web

100
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,340
consultant certification

101
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,859
Andy has been practicing soil

102
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,959
microbiology for over 12 years

103
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,780
during the first set we will talk about

104
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,299
seasonal impacts on soil and biological

105
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,699
activity focusing on the metabolism of

106
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,560
the soil changing food sources and

107
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,759
differences between container soil and

108
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,098
ground soil

109
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,840
the second set is the big one today as

110
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,479
we look in detail at the sorts of

111
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,459
nutrition available during winter and

112
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,699
discuss preparing soil with specific

113
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,459
compost tea Brews biological inoculants

114
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,979
like protozoa infusions and fungal Foods

115
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,280
as well as the effective use of mulches

116
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:19,079
and crop covers finally we finished the

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,358
episode in set three with a discussion

118
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,759
of best practices to revive your soil in

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,279
the spring in order to shorten its

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,319
transition from Winter dormancy to

121
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,219
actively growing your thriving cannabis

122
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,439
plants

123
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,780
today's episode comes from the

124
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,600
perspective of living soil and the soil

125
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:39,000
food web today we are most interested in

126
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,220
microbial life and the prey and Predator

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,899
relationship in the soil and how that

128
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,360
changes seasonally

129
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,939
certainly there are soil chemistry

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,280
aspects to be considered after having a

131
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:53,100
yearly soil test done but that's not the

132
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,198
focus today today we set aside mineral

133
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,820
and other amendments and focus squarely

134
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,740
on the preservation of biological

135
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,259
activity in the soil so that you can

136
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,960
preserve your gains from year to year

137
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:07,139
welcome to shaping fire Andy thank you

138
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,719
so much for having me so at the end of

139
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,019
the season temperatures obviously

140
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,160
decrease and at the lower temps life

141
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:20,698
slows down both above and below the soil

142
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,280
if the soil food web is cycling life all

143
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,340
summer so our cannabis plants can grow

144
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:30,299
I'd like to understand which aspects

145
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:32,519
slow down into the fall and winter in

146
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,740
the soil which causes everything to kind

147
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,978
of go to sleep so I guess I'd like you

148
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,918
to start off with a description of an

149
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:43,319
active soil food web a summertime soil

150
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:46,439
food web and then describe the

151
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:49,439
mechanisms that change and slow as we go

152
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,478
into winter so that as we talk about how

153
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,759
to interact with that

154
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,019
um we know we know the mechanisms that

155
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,780
we're talking about

156
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,758
sure so yeah you know with the food web

157
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,138
we're talking about these Predator prey

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,720
relationships

159
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:07,199
um below ground for the most part so

160
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,320
who's eating who and in the summer time

161
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,160
in a vegetative growth cycle flowering

162
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:17,939
cycle it's a very active partnership

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,160
between the plants and the microbes

164
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,719
below ground they're constantly

165
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,560
communicating they're feeding one

166
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,020
another and so in theory if you ha if

167
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,959
you've done a great job of inoculating

168
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:33,839
your soils in the spring and you've

169
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,459
established these relationships or

170
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,579
really introduced these relationships

171
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:41,099
between the plants and the microbes

172
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:43,079
there's a lot of predators eating prey

173
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,620
which is cycling nutrients so when I say

174
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,659
Predators I'm referring to things like

175
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,340
nematodes that's nematodes that feed

176
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,080
them bacteria nematodes that feed on

177
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,839
fungi

178
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,659
um and then the protozoa which are

179
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,538
primarily bacterial feeders things like

180
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,580
flagellates and amoeba ciliates as well

181
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,978
although and we can come back to this

182
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:08,038
ciliates are more of an an indicator

183
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:10,918
species that we use to um

184
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,779
provide as a sign of anaerobic

185
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,299
conditions in the soil and so we don't

186
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,579
want to see too many ciliates among the

187
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,379
protozoa in that ecosystem but this

188
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:22,279
brings me to the point of another

189
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:26,699
feature that's happening in a thriving

190
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:28,339
root zone is the element of diversity so

191
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,900
you'll have a lot of these different

192
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,638
types of organisms you're not just going

193
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,038
to see fungi are just going to see

194
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,978
bacteria you're going to see a little

195
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:41,060
bit of everything in your soil at that

196
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:44,639
time and so as things kind of get

197
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:47,000
colder and are going into a more dormant

198
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,579
state

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,720
the the main

200
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:57,000
element that is changing there is as the

201
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,240
plant dies back it's no longer providing

202
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,660
the root oxidates to kind of

203
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,418
be a source of fuel and energy for us

204
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,039
its microbial Partners below ground and

205
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,620
so their Dynamics change the the

206
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,538
microbial Partners below ground are

207
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,699
going to start feeding on other things

208
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,199
and finding other food sources and so

209
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,020
that's really important for us to know

210
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,060
as stewards is what are those food

211
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,740
sources do they have enough food because

212
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,720
in theory we actually want them to stay

213
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,120
as active as possible throughout the

214
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,500
winter and there's some reasons there's

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,019
some really important reasons for that

216
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,879
but in terms of what that that root Zone

217
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:36,538
could look like in the winter if we

218
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,759
don't consider the the microbes needs

219
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:43,080
through that period where they don't

220
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,799
have their plant photosynthesizing above

221
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,680
ground

222
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,419
things tend to go really dormant below

223
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,699
ground

224
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:52,079
and that means you have protozoa that

225
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,899
are insisting and they're no longer

226
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,820
feeding on bacteria in general bacteria

227
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,740
are kind of the hardiest group so you're

228
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,320
always going to have your your cold

229
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,299
loving bacteria your heat loving

230
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,120
bacteria and you'll always have some

231
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:08,219
kind of bacteria activity happening in

232
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,259
the root Zone but it's really a matter

233
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,560
of losing some of those larger organisms

234
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,620
like your your fungal activity your

235
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,559
nematode activity and protozoa that we

236
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,379
we want to really try to keep those

237
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,319
organism groups active rather than

238
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:27,958
allowing them to go into dormant States

239
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,040
so um that's interesting because I I

240
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,958
thought that you were going to say that

241
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,059
things slowed down because of the

242
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,039
temperature primarily but I'm getting

243
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,859
I'm getting the idea that

244
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:41,338
um while yes temperature probably plays

245
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,100
a role that really it's about the the

246
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:47,279
abundance of summertime

247
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,159
food sources that are decreasing and

248
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,559
that is actually what causes the I don't

249
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,778
know metabolism of the soil to slow down

250
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,679
right so like in nature if you think

251
00:09:54,778 --> 00:10:01,620
about a really mature forest ecosystem

252
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:04,739
one way that the trees uh in that

253
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,299
ecosystem continue providing for the

254
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,080
microbes underground that they're going

255
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:12,359
to rely on more so in spring and summer

256
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,399
is many of the deciduous trees are going

257
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,320
to drop their leaves and actually feed

258
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,120
that soil in a different way so it's no

259
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,100
longer through root oxidates but it's

260
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,659
through this Leaf litter on top of the

261
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,120
soil and that's doing two things that's

262
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:26,519
insulating the soil from those harsh

263
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,639
temperatures that you've referred to and

264
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:33,000
it's also providing some kind of organic

265
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,338
matter to feed into that system to keep

266
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,759
the the metabolism going below ground so

267
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:41,580
it can actually be quite busy if the

268
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,838
ecosystem is providing some kind of food

269
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,278
source and protection to the

270
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,240
microorganisms in the root Zone

271
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,338
I would think that if the food source is

272
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,399
changing during the winter from being

273
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:59,700
our cannabis roots and potential

274
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,159
companion plants to now not being

275
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,399
cannabis Roots perhaps still the

276
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,679
companion plantings but now

277
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,078
um you know Leaf litter and potentially

278
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,458
a top mulch or whatever whatever we're

279
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,559
going to put on the pot to help it

280
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:16,799
overwinter that that's actually going to

281
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,479
change the varieties of life forms that

282
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,740
are actually going to be active in the

283
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,320
soil too

284
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,560
it will it will certainly and a lot of

285
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,200
times that leaf litter or mulch that

286
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,239
you're topping off a container with or

287
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,399
the the soil itself with those are

288
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,919
carbon Rich

289
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,659
materials and so that is going to

290
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:41,219
provide more

291
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:43,439
um benefit to your your fungal uh types

292
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,440
of organisms so your fungi are breaking

293
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,079
down carbon Rich materials more so than

294
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,060
bacteria but they're all linked so as

295
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,500
one

296
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,958
organism starts feeding on a particular

297
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,240
material it inevitably creates a

298
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,299
byproduct that another organism can feed

299
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,579
on thus the soil food web everything's

300
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:05,338
dependent on everything else when when

301
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,919
when the pots I guess this question is

302
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,680
specifically container oriented but when

303
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,899
a container gets cold during the winter

304
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,759
um you know it gets it gets truly cold

305
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,519
in a way that

306
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,578
um the ground won't since the ground is

307
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,578
enjoying some geothermal benefits are

308
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:25,799
there some parts of the root Zone some

309
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,838
inhabitants that we just know we're

310
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,479
going to lose during the winter because

311
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,560
they'll cyst up because uh just simply

312
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,778
the the cold is enough to knock them

313
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,018
um knock them back into a dormant State

314
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,578
instead of just the losing of a their

315
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,578
food source

316
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:48,120
yes I kind of think of this on a good

317
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:52,199
better best scale so best case scenario

318
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,539
you're able to provide the root Zone

319
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,519
enough

320
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:59,039
fuel to and protection to actually

321
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,039
maintain some level of activity that's

322
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:05,519
not always possible but the second best

323
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:08,219
option would be to protect it enough

324
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,919
that those organisms that you do quote

325
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,800
unquote lose are at least insisting and

326
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,899
they're not actually dying which is you

327
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,479
know the the worst case scenario is that

328
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,940
the the

329
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:25,019
extreme temps or conditions that that

330
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,760
soil is exposed to is so severe that

331
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,259
you're actually killing the organisms

332
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,659
and you're essentially starting from

333
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,939
square one come springtime when you're

334
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,919
trying to rejuvenate that soil

335
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,519
interesting so

336
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:41,278
um so often we treat our containers and

337
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,959
sometimes even our Fields as okay we're

338
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,179
done with it and we just like people

339
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,099
just walk away from it and and you know

340
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,958
they get into trimming or or start

341
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,420
focusing on the holidays or you know

342
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,458
just doing anything other than farming

343
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:56,278
um because they've had a long summer but

344
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:59,458
I'm actually getting this idea now that

345
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,759
um you know the the that you want to

346
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:05,099
make sure that you button up your soil

347
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:08,220
properly before you walk away from it

348
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,800
and not to be too hasty about it because

349
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,500
we we want to kind of turn it from like

350
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,259
the the high you know the high very

351
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,740
active setting down to like a low simmer

352
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:22,379
for the winter because we we don't want

353
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,799
it to go entirely to sleep we just want

354
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:27,899
it to turn down so it it it it it eats

355
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,539
through the nutrition that we're setting

356
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,720
it up with slowly throughout the winter

357
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:36,179
so that so that when we when we when we

358
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,700
reapproach it in the spring we're not

359
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:41,759
we're not having to start it from a cold

360
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,459
start if you will there's already a low

361
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,759
warmth going on mm-hmm

362
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:50,039
yeah I think what you observed there

363
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,500
about how Hasty we can be once our

364
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,679
growing season is over it's really

365
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,379
an invitation to reflect a little bit

366
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,939
like I would I always encourage people

367
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,419
to consider

368
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,639
what's your relationship with that soil

369
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,259
that soil that you discarded or the soil

370
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,600
that you're no longer tending to just

371
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:12,778
because your cash crop isn't growing in

372
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,820
it right now and asking the question you

373
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,458
know are are we going to need that soil

374
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,459
to support our goals later or did we

375
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:23,759
rely on it this past season to produce

376
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,259
something meaningful for us and you know

377
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,120
just because the cash crop isn't

378
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,578
actively growing doesn't mean that our

379
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,519
stewardship responsibilities for that

380
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:34,679
crop are uh over

381
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,459
um we do have responsibilities and

382
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,159
there's

383
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:41,099
the biodiversity of the partners below

384
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,620
ground are part of what makes our crop

385
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,199
successful and so just you know building

386
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,379
a relationship and considering that when

387
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:52,379
you don't have your your crop in season

388
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:55,500
what are you doing to ensure that you're

389
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:57,799
caring for that soil system so that you

390
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,620
are introducing your plant to a very

391
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:03,838
hospitable new home come spring I really

392
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,419
like that emphasis on the stewardship I

393
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:11,279
remember a couple years back I visited

394
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:14,278
uh Nicholas over at a green um

395
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,078
the green Gardens in in Wolf Oregon and

396
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,000
and he was walking me through and and I

397
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,679
like it because they do a lot of food

398
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,240
planting underneath their cannabis

399
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,539
plants so they'll have cannabis growing

400
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,539
up top and and on potatoes growing

401
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:30,240
underneath and um uh green Source

402
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:32,278
Gardens that's it and so uh and I asked

403
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,440
him I said oh I bet you I said I bet

404
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,720
you're really going to be happy to like

405
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,060
walk away from the garden and and be

406
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,860
done with it and he says you know I I've

407
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:44,219
never really done with it he's all like

408
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:47,039
the the soil is a family member you know

409
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,379
and and just because

410
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,719
um it's we're going into winter I don't

411
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:54,240
I can't just turn my back on it

412
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,399
um I I need to do what I can to make

413
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,799
sure that it's taken care of and fed and

414
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,159
loved through the winter so that we're

415
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,240
not strangers in the spring and and like

416
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,459
the first part of that I may have

417
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,259
paraphrased poorly from him but the so

418
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,000
that so that we're not strangers with

419
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,959
the soil in the spring is the part that

420
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,838
really

421
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,100
um held on for for me me and uh and I

422
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,099
thought I thought that was beautiful and

423
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,599
and it sounds very similar to the this

424
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,119
idea of stewardship that you're putting

425
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,099
forth oh definitely I love that phrase

426
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,619
too to to be strangers in the spring

427
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,418
feels so uncomfortable and you almost

428
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,039
start feeling guilty at that point you

429
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:32,100
know because I've been there even even

430
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,798
as someone who considers themselves very

431
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,839
um enamored with soil more so than the

432
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,058
plant itself sometimes when that

433
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:43,079
planting season's over you just are

434
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:45,418
eager to get comfortable and and kind of

435
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,339
step away from that work for a while and

436
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:50,280
I think that's okay I think there's room

437
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:53,279
for both like we all deserve rest and we

438
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,779
should snatch rest when we can when we

439
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,879
can get it

440
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,859
um but there's you know finding a

441
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,860
balance like what does it mean to you to

442
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:04,979
stay connected to that soil throughout

443
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:07,079
the winter and finding ways to do it uh

444
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,980
that that makes sense to you and given

445
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:12,899
that season of of the year in life

446
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,240
um I think also to take it into a

447
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,240
non-soil example I feel the same way

448
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,400
when I Rush taking the plastic off of my

449
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,440
greenhouses in the fall and if I don't

450
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,840
put them away properly you know if I

451
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,360
don't if I don't wash them down let them

452
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,099
dry fold them up and like lovingly put

453
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,678
them back you know if it's a season

454
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,480
where I pull them down wet I roll them

455
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,640
into a ball and I shove them in the back

456
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,220
of the barn which you know it's not

457
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,620
something that I I'm ever proud of but

458
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,079
it happens sometimes and when I come

459
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:46,199
back in the spring I see that you know

460
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,480
now the the it's it the plastic is moldy

461
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,519
and it's and it's and it's crunchy and

462
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,579
it's it's all like oh you did me bad

463
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:56,220
Shango you know and um I that same thing

464
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:58,199
happens with our soil if if we if we

465
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,579
want to have a good start in our spring

466
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,500
we need to end the fall properly as well

467
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,980
um so let's let's talk about the some of

468
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,579
the differences that um that there is in

469
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:17,038
the The Changing from a a container

470
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:19,139
versus the ground and so um you know

471
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,359
during during set two we're gonna go

472
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,700
into more detail about the things we

473
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,000
want to do

474
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,500
um for our soil what whatever whether

475
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,380
it's in the ground or whether it's in a

476
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,900
container but as far as the the coming

477
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,919
of winter I would think that the

478
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:41,100
containers are at a much higher risk of

479
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:45,538
getting true seasonal damage than the

480
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:48,779
soil is because we have a a smaller

481
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:51,058
diverse diversity of life forms because

482
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,500
it's just contained in the container and

483
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:54,298
things aren't generally coming in and

484
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,538
out unless it's being like delivered by

485
00:19:54,298 --> 00:20:00,240
you know birds or frogs or uh people

486
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:01,519
people and life forms that are going by

487
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,240
right

488
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:09,418
versus the the actual ground soil which

489
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,120
has got a huge amount of biodiversity

490
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,600
and also is being somewhat kept warm

491
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:17,279
just from the nature of Earth

492
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:19,500
would you agree that that those of us

493
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,139
who are growing in containers really

494
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,660
have to pay more attention because the

495
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,640
ground some more often than not will

496
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,600
cover your mistakes whereas a container

497
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,700
won't

498
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,579
yeah the ground is much more forgiving

499
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,860
in that way certainly and you know not

500
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:37,859
to say that we we can't also find a way

501
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:41,038
to mess that up but right by poor

502
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:44,298
practices but in general more forgiving

503
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:46,859
in ground planting and in ground

504
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:49,019
you know stewardship of the of the micro

505
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:51,779
world I think

506
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:55,379
it's like anything in controlled

507
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:58,019
agriculture or uh when we're trying to

508
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,600
emulate nature it's it's always

509
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,058
imperfect but we just do our best and so

510
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:05,339
when we have these containers

511
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:07,740
um I think definitely the two points

512
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:10,678
that you brought up are the are the most

513
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:15,359
um obvious ones you know like you have

514
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,620
more of that service is exposed and what

515
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,240
the service I'm talking about is like

516
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:21,178
the actual root zone is exposed where

517
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,359
that's just not the case in ground and

518
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:26,519
the the observation you made about

519
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,979
migration of organisms is kind of a less

520
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,099
obvious one to people so that really is

521
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,319
a limiting factor if you think about it

522
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:36,658
like even during the growing season you

523
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,639
don't have migration between one root

524
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,860
Zone and another and sometimes that can

525
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,679
be helpful if you have really strong

526
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:46,379
plants with great microbial Partnerships

527
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,780
that are thriving and then maybe some

528
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,880
plants that have some kind of disease

529
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,980
and could benefit from

530
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,020
um you know the migration of those

531
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,419
organisms from one one side of your

532
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:58,918
planting to the other and some people

533
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,780
would actually view that in the opposite

534
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,520
way it's kind of like a is this glass

535
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,079
half full or half empty and some people

536
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,720
would be concerned like oh well when you

537
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:10,558
share a root zone now you have the risk

538
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,740
of pathogens tearing through and that

539
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,240
that is also true but if you're if

540
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,480
you're actually growing from a

541
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,140
biological perspective

542
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,880
your decisions and your amendments are

543
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,700
all about focusing on beneficial

544
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,059
organisms and kind of taking up real

545
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:32,400
estate uh on on the root surfaces and

546
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,779
Plant Services as well because they

547
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,360
migrate below ground and above ground

548
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:38,940
all these organisms and you're taking up

549
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,918
real estate so that Pest and pathogens

550
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,960
don't even have a chance to come in so

551
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,200
that's really what we're doing with our

552
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,720
amendments whether it's in pots or in

553
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,000
ground but I do find that you have to be

554
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,279
much more diligent in any kind of

555
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,319
container because each each plant now is

556
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,839
has its own root Zone that you have to

557
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:03,359
tend to rather than one single root Zone

558
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,279
that has shared resources and shared

559
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,199
communication between the plants as well

560
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,379
I think that's one of the first things

561
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,319
that we have to give up when we start

562
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,080
practicing natural Farming versus

563
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,639
some of the more sterile kinds like like

564
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,500
you know certain types of Hydroponics

565
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,919
and such is that

566
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,380
um we are we don't have

567
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,679
sterile soil there are pathogens in

568
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,740
every one of our pots and and it's not

569
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:35,340
about like making sure my containers

570
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,620
don't have any pathogens it's about

571
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,240
um uh feeding the beneficials and making

572
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:41,759
sure the environment for the beneficials

573
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,859
are positive so that they are always out

574
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,140
competing the pathogens but we know the

575
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,819
pathogens are there it's a it's a hard

576
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,159
truth that's like really creeps a lot of

577
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:52,798
people out when they when they come to

578
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,539
regenerative style farming at first but

579
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,980
but you know technically the pathogens

580
00:23:54,538 --> 00:24:00,839
are part of of the the food web as well

581
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,720
and we just want them to play a very

582
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,220
small role yes I agree and I feel like

583
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,558
there might even be an analogy here

584
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,940
somewhere like with our human societies

585
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,399
like you're always going to have a bad

586
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,019
egg on a team but in general that team's

587
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,400
much more resilient when you have a lot

588
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:19,019
of you know good healthy communicative

589
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,298
partners that are helping move the ball

590
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:22,918
forward you know and they might even uh

591
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:24,839
band together and say enough is enough

592
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,720
and we're getting rid of this parasite

593
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:31,379
that is in you know messing with our our

594
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,538
goals so I if you can kind of sometimes

595
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,820
that helps to just relate to the soil in

596
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:39,019
some ways like thinking about it their

597
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:42,658
communities similar to ours in general

598
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:45,200
you know their the systems in place are

599
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:49,080
are moving towards beneficial

600
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,659
Partnerships and it's only when there's

601
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:54,359
an imbalance in the ecosystem that

602
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,880
there's a specific set of organisms that

603
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,379
take advantage of that and let me just

604
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,179
take a moment too shingo if you don't

605
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,240
mind kind of explaining some of my

606
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:05,159
perspective on pathogens

607
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,179
um because I think it might be of

608
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:11,460
interest here please the when I think of

609
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:15,059
pathogens this is you know this is me

610
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,179
trying to Reef frame pathogens so I'm

611
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:20,220
I'm not perfect at you know not getting

612
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:23,100
angry when I see when I see something

613
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,919
that is destroying the garden but I

614
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:28,500
think of pathogens as filling a role in

615
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,659
the ecosystem what a pathogens

616
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,319
essentially doing and and why it's

617
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:36,778
evolved is that that soil is sick in

618
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,418
some way and it's destroying the above

619
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:44,099
ground organic matter to feed that soil

620
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:46,020
and you know in time that process of

621
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:47,519
pests and pathogens destroying the above

622
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,079
ground parts of the plants and we're

623
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,839
turning those nutrients to the soil

624
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:54,240
would set the stage for a stronger more

625
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,980
resilient environment that would

626
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,019
actually support more and more

627
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,400
beneficial

628
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:02,579
microorganisms and kind of do themselves

629
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,740
the pathogens out of their job so when

630
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:08,158
you see a pathogen it's really telling

631
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,960
to say oh well something's amiss here

632
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,240
the plant isn't actually getting

633
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,360
everything that it needs for me so this

634
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,339
is that's one way that the ecosystem is

635
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,038
communicating with you and instead of

636
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:22,619
trying to stamp it out with pesticides

637
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,740
and whatever else we can get our hands

638
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:28,558
on that is more of like a sterilizing

639
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,778
effect just consider what can we do to

640
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,418
add to the system to give that plant

641
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:36,900
what it needs in order to fight that

642
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:39,120
pathogen or eliminate it so that it's no

643
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,200
longer needed in that ecosystem I think

644
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,538
that's a really healthy way of looking

645
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,140
at it that that even though I mean

646
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:49,500
because our goal is to have beautiful

647
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:52,320
high terpene profile High cannabinoid

648
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,440
flowers that's that's the end goal

649
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,418
and so the if the pathogen is

650
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,400
challenging us from getting to our goal

651
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,799
it makes us want to be pissed off at the

652
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,840
pathogen right when actually it is

653
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:07,980
playing its role just like just like if

654
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:10,199
I get sick and I get a uh I get a a high

655
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,480
temperature myself and I'm like oh I'm

656
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,759
so tired from having this this high

657
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,558
temperature but but my body is

658
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,440
intentionally increasing the temperature

659
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:22,319
so that I can heal it's trying to heal

660
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,620
me and and I think that if we embrace

661
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:27,658
the pathogens as being a partner but a

662
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,939
partner that we really don't want to

663
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,740
have to do their role very often that's

664
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,600
probably a more holistic approach to

665
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,079
thinking about our soil instead of like

666
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,519
good guys and bad guys exactly exactly I

667
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:40,980
appreciate that analogy that you

668
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,500
provided as well right on so all right

669
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,259
great well um I think that set two where

670
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,940
we talk about the what to do and why is

671
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:50,038
going to be the fattest of the three

672
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,360
sets so why don't we go ahead and wrap

673
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,400
up and go to our commercial break and

674
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,538
then we'll get right to set at two which

675
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,460
is probably what most people are here

676
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:58,019
for anyway so we're going to go ahead

677
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,480
and take a short break and be right back

678
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,819
you are listening to shaping fire and my

679
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,099
guest today is soil biologist Andy Marsh

680
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:06,658
so without these advertisers shaping

681
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:08,399
fire wouldn't happen so please support

682
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:11,000
them and let them know you heard them on

683
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,000
shaping fire

684
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,019
there are so many seed banks nowadays

685
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,360
that you really have options and who to

686
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:20,460
choose not only that if you pick the

687
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,859
wrong seed bank you could be in for a

688
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,500
really sketchy ride and that's only one

689
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:27,418
of the reasons I recommend Gas Lamp

welcome back you are listening to

838
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,179
shaping fire I am your host shangolos

839
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:09,418
and my guest today is soil biologist

840
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,700
Andy Marsh so before the break we were

841
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,679
talking about you know getting us all on

842
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,378
the same page as far as an understanding

843
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,440
of the soil food web what is happening

844
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:22,618
like systemically uh in the soil as

845
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,980
temperatures cool and kind of making

846
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:26,879
sure that we all understand that we're

847
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,940
not

848
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:34,199
the winter does not make the system stop

849
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:38,099
the winter makes the system slow and so

850
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:41,519
um set two is going to all be about what

851
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:44,519
can we do for our soil in what ways so

852
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,639
that we can turn our soil down to this

853
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:51,000
slow simmer so we don't become strangers

854
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,399
with it in the spring so

855
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,858
um what do you think about this Andy I I

856
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:59,759
was trying to figure out what our goals

857
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:02,519
are for containers and and soil going

858
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,940
into the winter and I and I I made this

859
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:10,139
list that we wanted the soil to be fed

860
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:12,000
warm watered drained and then undamaged

861
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:14,098
during the winter does that sound like a

862
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,320
pretty good list to you yeah I really

863
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:18,180
like the last one undamaged I would I

864
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,740
would have used the word undisturbed but

865
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:22,219
I think we're getting at the same thing

866
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:26,039
it's like basically just not trying to

867
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:27,899
disrupt that all of those organisms that

868
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:28,759
are doing their their work during the

869
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,559
winter

870
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,099
so let's start by getting rid of

871
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:37,559
something that I see all the time on

872
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,559
um like not not huge farms but just like

873
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:44,759
scaled regenerative Farms it is not

874
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:47,519
uncommon for me to go to a farm tour and

875
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,000
to see that cultivators have stacked

876
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:53,960
their large containers during the off

877
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,219
season and you know

878
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,679
just looking at it it looks like an

879
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:03,059
obviously bad practice because at the

880
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:07,500
very least we are compacting the soil by

881
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:09,239
stacking the the pots and and every time

882
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,820
you go up a level it's more and more

883
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,039
weight that's compacting the soil

884
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:18,180
um but I bet that you have

885
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:20,460
even other very more specific uh reasons

886
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:22,500
why we should not be stacking our

887
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,480
especially fabric pots

888
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,559
um uh over the winter so would we start

889
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,719
with that because I want to I want to

890
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,599
remove that as an option for folks no

891
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,419
sure yeah I think there's a lot of

892
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,059
a lot of evidence for not wanting to to

893
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,220
do that um I'm sure let me just first

894
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:40,380
start by kind of empathizing with why

895
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:42,179
you might find yourself doing that and I

896
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,220
suspect it's one kind of what we're

897
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,419
talking about earlier about you're done

898
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:48,439
with the growing season you're just

899
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:51,000
trying to pack things up and get things

900
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,858
put put away and kind of out of sight

901
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,139
and in a space where they're not going

902
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:58,019
to be completely drenched in snow or

903
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:59,759
whatever else so I can empathize with

904
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:02,579
wanting to stack your

905
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,900
pots of soil you know in a corner and

906
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,720
you might even think that you're doing a

907
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,000
good thing by removing them from the

908
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,399
elements in some regard

909
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,800
um I but the more you kind of consider

910
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,858
what's going on in those pots the less

911
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,599
of a good idea this this becomes because

912
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:21,380
you're right you are certainly

913
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,760
compacting the soil and that's

914
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,619
problematic for

915
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,839
a lot of reasons

916
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:31,440
um reason number one though a soil

917
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:34,380
structure is something that I get really

918
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,039
excited about because it's it's where

919
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,619
like biology chemistry and the physics

920
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:43,559
of the soil meat is like creating great

921
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:45,960
soil structure and it's something that

922
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,759
we're attempting to create throughout

923
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,358
the growing season and we whether we

924
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,640
realize it or not are contributing to or

925
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,858
or taking away from throughout the

926
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:58,139
growing season and then come winter time

927
00:37:55,858 --> 00:38:00,299
if we don't realize what kind of gains

928
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:02,940
we made in terms of the improving the

929
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,820
soil structure and then we go and stock

930
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,159
these soils like that we're really

931
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,079
setting our we're really kind of

932
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,358
regressing in terms of whatever progress

933
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,480
we might have made

934
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:18,239
in improving that soil's structure so

935
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,500
yeah compaction is like a Surefire way

936
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,659
to kind of

937
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,699
um you're you're not only physically

938
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,739
putting pressure to the soil surface

939
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:27,838
office and creating compaction from the

940
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,939
top down but you're also kind of sealing

941
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:33,480
off the top of that soil so there's

942
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,000
limited air exchange and and limited

943
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,420
moisture exchange and this is what

944
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,019
happens in in-ground systems when we

945
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,400
um

946
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:45,960
compact them through any number of means

947
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,539
that's called soil sealing when you do

948
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,320
that and and whether you're doing it by

949
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:54,960
stocking pots or you know mowing a space

950
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,880
to too often and creating compaction

951
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,099
that way the at the end of the day

952
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,160
you're really reducing that soil's

953
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:03,300
ability to bring oxygen in which all of

954
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,920
these microbes that we're talking about

955
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,740
all these beneficial microbes really

956
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,380
need oxygen and the ones that thrive in

957
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:12,358
oxygen poor environments are are

958
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,300
pathogens

959
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:18,838
right on so so we want to make sure that

960
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:23,099
we our topsoil can get air exchange it

961
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:25,440
can get some uh you know rain and snow

962
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,960
and you know interact with with uh

963
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,639
nature as it will and

964
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,420
um I like what you said where you know

965
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:36,299
if we spend all summer treating our soil

966
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:40,500
fantastically why on Earth would we want

967
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:43,740
to suddenly give those advances back by

968
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,500
by stacking them and then crushing the

969
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:48,559
soil uh structure that we've and our

970
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,119
worms have spent all summer working on

971
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,858
exactly and that makes our job a lot

972
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,660
harder come springtime when we're

973
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:55,980
dealing with soil if you plan to reuse

974
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,659
that soil which

975
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,460
you know you might not you might find

976
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:01,799
that you actually need to purchase new

977
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,019
soil or make new soil which can be very

978
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,880
labor intensive and I feel like if you

979
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:08,940
the more you can do taking care of the

980
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,338
soil you got uh the less labor and

981
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,519
inputs and expenses you'll have come

982
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:16,739
springtime in dealing with that soil I'm

983
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:19,559
really grateful that the the Cannabis

984
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:22,618
growing scene as a whole has

985
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:25,460
um embraced reusing soil

986
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:27,780
um it wasn't it wasn't too long ago that

987
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:33,059
people thought that they needed to

988
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:35,880
re-buy soil for every cycle both indoors

989
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:38,400
and Out and because they wanted to keep

990
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,760
it as sterile as possible but sure but

991
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,460
but now we're realizing that that aged

992
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,119
older soil has with has got so much more

993
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,460
uh personality if you will and and it's

994
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,440
that biodiversity which actually makes

995
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,159
your cannabis taste good

996
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,220
um

997
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:58,019
yeah I like that

998
00:40:55,219 --> 00:41:00,779
I'm like sipping on my coffee here but

999
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:03,539
yes yes I I'm glad to hear that about

1000
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,720
about cannabis cultures that you're able

1001
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:08,880
to see this shift towards uh reusing

1002
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,519
soil and rejuvenating it rather than

1003
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,140
yeah creating more and more sterile

1004
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,599
environments that's a good thing all

1005
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:17,838
right so if our goals for our soil is to

1006
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,838
have it fed warm watered and drained

1007
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:24,900
let's start with the FED part so

1008
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,480
um uh many folks have got their favorite

1009
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,460
uh amendments that they you know they've

1010
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,579
harvested their cannabis plant and then

1011
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,980
they will they will amend or inoculate

1012
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,200
or add something

1013
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,300
um before they walk away for the winter

1014
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:43,439
so let's let's talk about a couple of

1015
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,539
those and specifically you know as I was

1016
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,539
saying in the introduction we're not

1017
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:51,599
approaching today's episode

1018
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:53,699
um dryly chemically like okay I did my

1019
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,400
soil test and now I need to add this

1020
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:58,919
kind of NPK kind of action we're talking

1021
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,200
about what kinds of amendments we're

1022
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,920
going to be doing to keep the the life

1023
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:08,159
force of the living soil intact and so

1024
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,220
by all means you know do your do your

1025
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,960
soil tests and and react to those but we

1026
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:16,679
also want to make sure that our soil

1027
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:20,400
just stays alive so so let's start with

1028
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:22,919
nutrition so um so taking what you said

1029
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,539
during the first set that there are

1030
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:30,300
um the food sources are changing from

1031
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:33,480
the uh from the rhizosphere getting

1032
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:35,039
exudates from my cannabis plant roots

1033
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,199
and having that back and forth

1034
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:40,858
relationship but now the cannabis plant

1035
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:43,679
is gone and so I want to add some

1036
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:47,519
nutrition so that

1037
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:50,219
um Everybody stays alive in the root

1038
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:55,019
Zone when the root zones are not feeding

1039
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:58,019
them so what types of um nutrition as a

1040
00:42:55,019 --> 00:43:00,300
soil biologist do you find are are going

1041
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:02,280
to be most beneficial for the folks that

1042
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,480
we want to keep going

1043
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:09,180
yeah so so one way to think about this

1044
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,920
is to take it take an approach where

1045
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:14,159
you're providing a variety of foods

1046
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,920
because again the theme Here of the day

1047
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:20,039
is going to be biodiversity so if you're

1048
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,639
trying to cultivate nurture and maintain

1049
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:26,400
a biodiverse microbial Community then

1050
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:29,039
you the more different types of foods

1051
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,920
you can provide to your soils often the

1052
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:34,679
better and so one way to do that is to

1053
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,500
take a multi-prong approach by feeding

1054
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,179
the soils through maybe a cover crop so

1055
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,818
that that you know something that would

1056
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:44,219
survive your conditions when you're not

1057
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:47,159
growing your cannabis plant anymore but

1058
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:52,559
you instead come and plant a cover crop

1059
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:55,739
that will feed the soil root oxidates in

1060
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,659
lieu of your cash crop and then compost

1061
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:00,059
tea is another great

1062
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:02,159
option I and I would just want to take a

1063
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:05,400
moment to kind of explain the difference

1064
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:07,500
between an extract and a tea and an

1065
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,559
extract is you're generally just trying

1066
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:14,039
to knock the microbes off the surfaces

1067
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,779
of solid compost so that you end up with

1068
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:18,779
a liquid that has just kind of

1069
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:21,200
free-floating organisms and those are

1070
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:24,060
really great for soil drenches

1071
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,519
also in containers of course to kind of

1072
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:29,338
infiltrate those organisms through the

1073
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:30,838
soil profile and teas are a little bit

1074
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:32,759
different in that you have that Brewing

1075
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:34,440
step so you so you do the same thing

1076
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,140
where you're knocking off the microbes

1077
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,119
from the surfaces of the solid compost

1078
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:40,559
but this time you'll have a brewing

1079
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,380
cycle where you're adding microbial

1080
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:46,500
foods and you're effectively increasing

1081
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:48,960
the population sizes of those organisms

1082
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,559
and you're kind of providing them this

1083
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,019
packed lunch so to speak whenever you

1084
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,338
distribute that liquid onto your your

1085
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:58,079
soils

1086
00:44:56,338 --> 00:45:03,000
and so

1087
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:05,339
um I like teas as a method to feed the

1088
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,159
root Zone in the winter time because it

1089
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:11,460
has more microbial Foods in it and I'm

1090
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:14,759
not so focused on inoculating because it

1091
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,740
it is a challenging time and

1092
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,099
um we in theory if we've done a lot of

1093
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:22,139
great inoculating throughout the season

1094
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:24,619
um our main goal is just providing a

1095
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:27,000
food source and not so much on

1096
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:30,240
inoculating of course inoculating is

1097
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,739
always happening so it comes Springtime

1098
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,959
I just kind of want to differentiate

1099
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:37,318
that you're you'd be more focused on

1100
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,300
introducing new organisms into that soil

1101
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,358
but not so much in the fall and winter

1102
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:46,740
and then lastly there's you know compost

1103
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:50,460
and and mulch are also ways to feed the

1104
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:51,959
soil nutrition and those are those are

1105
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,039
going to be a different set of food as

1106
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,280
well than what you might have

1107
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:58,318
Incorporated through a tea and of course

1108
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,660
course the the cover crop is kind of the

1109
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,338
unique food source that we can't

1110
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:04,139
necessarily replicate because it's

1111
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:07,259
coming directly from a photosynthesizing

1112
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:08,879
plant oh gosh there's so much in this in

1113
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,560
that answer I'm excited to tear this

1114
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,780
apart with you all right so let's go

1115
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,400
step by step so

1116
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,500
um so the first thing we that you were

1117
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,318
talking about was the variety of

1118
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,599
nutrition so so

1119
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:23,460
um uh uh I'm going to ask my next

1120
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,700
question about compost tea but right now

1121
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,980
I'm talking about what

1122
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:32,699
um like natural amendments so so are you

1123
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:36,300
are you talking about adding the for

1124
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:39,719
example like uh like like crab shell and

1125
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:42,539
feather meal and alfalfa meal and like

1126
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:45,000
things like that uh like making a blend

1127
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:49,318
of that like we would when we are making

1128
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,139
soil and then and then putting that onto

1129
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:54,900
the soil as a top dress or or that maybe

1130
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:57,358
will then cover with a mulch or are you

1131
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,940
talking about specifically adding that

1132
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,078
type those types of nutrition and and if

1133
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,539
so

1134
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,660
um what what varieties of that nutrition

1135
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:07,259
do you think work well in Winter

1136
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:10,559
um

1137
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:13,940
the ones that you mentioned feel more

1138
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,920
like they they lean towards mineral

1139
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:19,019
amendments which you know do eventually

1140
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,680
end up interacting with Biology I mean

1141
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:26,039
most everything does but

1142
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:28,679
um I that's where I would again kind of

1143
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:32,699
take this approach to your soil Health

1144
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:35,838
not strictly from this dogmatic biology

1145
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:39,299
is the only thing that matters mode but

1146
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:42,480
more more from an interdisciplinary

1147
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:46,160
approach and and really doing those soil

1148
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,780
chemistry reports a saturated Pace tests

1149
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:50,639
and maybe even considering some of the

1150
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,119
leaf tissue analysis that you might have

1151
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:55,879
done during the growing season and those

1152
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,858
are the things that are going to inform

1153
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,079
your mineral amendments that you might

1154
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:03,719
want to make and I do think this is a

1155
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:07,019
good time to be making those mineral

1156
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,000
amendments going into the winter and all

1157
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:11,519
this this is an experiment too right

1158
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,980
you'll you'll find that maybe you

1159
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,838
amended the soil going into your dormant

1160
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,880
period and then I would recommend

1161
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:21,000
testing it again once you're it comes

1162
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,579
planting time and just see like did it

1163
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,858
move the needle and on in some areas

1164
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:28,740
maybe it did in some areas it didn't and

1165
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:30,598
record that stuff you know really be

1166
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:33,299
diligent about

1167
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:36,240
um what's functioning and what's not and

1168
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,339
getting curious about why that might be

1169
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,078
um so I hope that kind of answers part

1170
00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:41,940
of your question it does I actually

1171
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,300
think that I just learned something

1172
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:49,500
because the very nature of my question I

1173
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:52,740
think is wrong so I I asked that

1174
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,300
question with the Assumption or belief

1175
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:56,159
that

1176
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,900
um I like this term mineral amendments

1177
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,118
that these these types of mineral

1178
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,940
amendments that are the same ones that

1179
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:04,858
we use when we're responding to a soil

1180
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,139
test and we need to we need to round out

1181
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:12,960
our soil I was under the impression

1182
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:16,739
question that the microbe life also ate

1183
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,059
these these mineral amendments and so in

1184
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:21,179
my head

1185
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:24,960
I was I was going to feed my microbe

1186
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:26,219
life both by adding compost tea which

1187
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,159
we'll talk more about in a minute but

1188
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:31,679
also with these

1189
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:34,799
um with these other mineral amendments

1190
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:39,318
but but I guess it's it's probably true

1191
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:42,300
that that microbe life may not even eat

1192
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,400
minerals I mean I make if I could be

1193
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,420
really wrong on this and and but I'm

1194
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,280
always I'm always learning and

1195
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,639
embarrassing myself publicly yeah on the

1196
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,460
show anyway so so so do does the life

1197
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,618
the the living parts of the rhizosphere

1198
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,838
do they eat that stuff or not

1199
00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:00,000
yeah and and to be clear I'm always

1200
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:04,259
learning too so you know just keep that

1201
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,119
in mind but my expectation is that those

1202
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:08,760
mineral amendments are really useful

1203
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:10,380
during the growing season when we

1204
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,859
recognize that there's a mineral

1205
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:16,140
deficiency the because the plant is in

1206
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:19,199
relationship with the microbes there's

1207
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:22,318
communication happening and in

1208
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:24,000
incentives being offered to those

1209
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,338
microbes to provide the particular

1210
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,858
minerals that that plant is deficient in

1211
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:31,858
and so it's pulling it is providing that

1212
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:34,559
from the minerals that we're adding but

1213
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:38,578
maybe that Dynamic Isn't So relevant

1214
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:41,818
come at winter time because you don't

1215
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:44,700
have that same crop in you know as part

1216
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:47,099
of that ecosystem this is a breakthrough

1217
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:49,980
moment for me I get this so the mineral

1218
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:53,579
amendments are not really for feeding

1219
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:56,719
the microbes the mineral amendments are

1220
00:50:53,579 --> 00:51:00,059
what the plant wants and the microbes

1221
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:02,338
will bring them to the plant in exchange

1222
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:04,619
for exudates and other types of food

1223
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:07,019
from the plant but during the winter

1224
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:08,700
when the plant isn't there we don't

1225
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:11,519
really need the mineral amendments

1226
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:13,379
because there's no bartering going on

1227
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,780
between the microbe life and the plant

1228
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,358
and so

1229
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:20,900
we're just trying to replace what the

1230
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:24,420
microblife normally gets from the plant

1231
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,280
right and I would say I would say more

1232
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,920
we're not necessarily trying to

1233
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,440
replicate exudates in any way we're

1234
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,358
we're trying to provide foods that we

1235
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,700
know

1236
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:38,900
microorganisms feed on when there are no

1237
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:42,419
living plant roots and that's in general

1238
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:45,780
organic matter so like your humic acids

1239
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:50,099
fulvic acids when you're brewing a tea

1240
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:52,019
maybe you consider fish hydrolyzate and

1241
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:54,019
you want to do these things mindfully so

1242
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:57,358
I'm not going to

1243
00:51:54,019 --> 00:52:00,000
get in to any specific ratios or

1244
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:02,159
anything here but just you know kind of

1245
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,579
stay high level in terms of how to think

1246
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,259
through it but when you're when you're

1247
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:11,099
brewing a tea

1248
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:13,920
you want to consider what what is living

1249
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:16,559
in your soil and you can do this through

1250
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,559
a microscopy assessment that's the most

1251
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,260
a Surefire way to know what's living in

1252
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:24,420
there and what's not

1253
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,460
but you can also kind of do this through

1254
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:30,059
Maybe

1255
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:32,099
maybe to other indirect observations so

1256
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:33,660
for instance if your mulch isn't really

1257
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:35,519
breaking down like you've had Mulch on

1258
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:38,519
your pots all through the summer time

1259
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,079
and it it still looks pretty good at the

1260
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:42,480
end of that season and it's not being

1261
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,880
broken down odds are you could benefit

1262
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,219
from more fungal activity so maybe when

1263
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,019
you go to brew dot compost tea you're

1264
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:51,058
adding more fungal Foods rather than

1265
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:53,699
bacterial Foods so bacteria foods are

1266
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:55,040
simple sugars things like molasses and

1267
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:58,799
and honey

1268
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:01,440
where the the fungal foods are going to

1269
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,940
be more complex sugars

1270
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:09,000
all right so let's let's talk more about

1271
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:11,220
um the compost tea as the nutrition for

1272
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,639
the rhizosphere

1273
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:16,799
um uh and and less of it as

1274
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,019
um using mineral amendments so if we

1275
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,079
want if we're if we're going to be

1276
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:23,519
putting the compost tea into the soil at

1277
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,900
the beginning like let's call it late

1278
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,780
fall

1279
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:31,440
um is the idea that we want to we're

1280
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,480
essentially trying to add

1281
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,980
um

1282
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:40,139
microbe life

1283
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:43,559
to the soil via the compost tea that

1284
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:46,799
um that then the

1285
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,780
larger microbe life that's in the

1286
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,760
container will then be eating so

1287
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,339
essentially we're we're pouring compost

1288
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,800
tea filled with smaller life that the

1289
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:58,019
Predators that would be normally getting

1290
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,099
its food from the plant will then be

1291
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:00,780
eating

1292
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,818
all the life forms that are in the

1293
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,400
compost tea is is is that what we're

1294
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:07,440
doing we're trying to

1295
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,059
um sustain this predator-prey

1296
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,679
relationship

1297
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:12,059
um throughout the winter yeah yeah

1298
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:14,159
that's a good way to look at it it's

1299
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:17,880
like you're providing you're providing

1300
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:21,719
prey organisms to nematodes and protozoa

1301
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:24,960
the predators in the soil and you're

1302
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:26,519
also providing that packed lunch so

1303
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,380
um like the the foods that you're adding

1304
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:31,440
to your compost tea are going to end up

1305
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,960
in the soil once you apply it and not

1306
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,240
just feeding the organisms that were in

1307
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,300
the tea Brewer but now they're available

1308
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,699
to the organisms that are existing in

1309
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,740
the container

1310
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:46,139
and and at this time of year I know

1311
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:49,618
we're we're both fans of brewed tea and

1312
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:52,199
also extracts but this time of year we

1313
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:54,180
actually want to do a brewed tea because

1314
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:57,179
we want to

1315
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:59,940
um we want to increase the density of

1316
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:04,919
the microbe life because we you want to

1317
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:07,019
offer lots of options of of varieties of

1318
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,818
microbe life that's going to be in the

1319
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:10,679
compost tea but we also want it to be

1320
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:12,558
very dense because we want it to last

1321
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:16,019
throughout the winter right

1322
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:18,119
yes I think I think teas are the way to

1323
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,500
go in the winter and look you it's not

1324
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:21,260
that you're doing anything wrong if you

1325
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,818
do an extract so

1326
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:27,720
the extract just doesn't have the added

1327
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:30,599
benefit of the increase in microbial

1328
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:33,118
activity nor does it have the microbial

1329
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:36,599
Foods both of which can be of benefit

1330
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,519
going into this more dormant period so

1331
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,859
obviously if we if we've got a

1332
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:43,980
microscope or or if we have the access

1333
00:55:40,858 --> 00:55:46,619
to Someone Like You who does microscopy

1334
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:49,800
for other folks you know for a living

1335
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:53,338
um that is one great way to know how we

1336
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,680
want to build our fall brewed compost

1337
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:57,960
because you can like literally look and

1338
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,000
see who's in the soil and see who's

1339
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,400
there that you want to feed and then and

1340
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,099
then who you might want to add to the

1341
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,099
soil to kind of round out the the

1342
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:13,200
Predator prey relationship but honestly

1343
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:15,900
most folks who don't have a cannabis

1344
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,279
growing business or just home Growers

1345
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,920
um they're they're probably not going to

1346
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,760
do that and so can you can you give some

1347
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:26,400
advice or or uh some mental structure to

1348
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,400
what the rest of us should do to like

1349
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,940
what would you recommend to have in our

1350
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:35,700
brewed tea at for for fall

1351
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,220
um when we don't exactly know what's in

1352
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:42,299
our soil but we we want to give it kind

1353
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:44,519
of a a general Buffet so that so that

1354
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,680
um we can do the best we can without

1355
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:50,159
exact knowledge

1356
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:52,799
yeah I think the the biggest thing to be

1357
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:58,318
aware of is that what we don't want to

1358
00:56:52,800 --> 00:57:00,780
do is be brewing a bunch of bacteria and

1359
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:03,300
putting that on our soils and I say that

1360
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:06,780
because a really common characteristic

1361
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:09,599
of a disturbed ecosoil ecosystem is that

1362
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:11,119
it's very bacteria dominant and when it

1363
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,440
comes to cannabis

1364
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:17,579
we want a little more balance between

1365
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:20,400
our bacteria and fungi ratio instead of

1366
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:24,920
it being entirely bacteria dominant so

1367
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:27,660
in general fungi is more sensitive to

1368
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:31,800
Mechanical disturbance certainly so

1369
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:34,500
anytime we dump our containers or turn

1370
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,140
them in any kind of way or they're

1371
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,358
exposed for long periods of time we'll

1372
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:42,838
expect to lose some kind of fungal

1373
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:45,358
biomass but not but will actually see an

1374
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:47,519
increase in bacterial biomass and the

1375
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:50,039
reason for that is that bacteria start

1376
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,079
feeding on the fungi that are dying off

1377
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,058
and they kind of have a little party all

1378
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,420
to themselves to increase their numbers

1379
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:58,920
and so that that's one balance that we

1380
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,980
want to be really careful about when

1381
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:04,500
we're making our own amendments and and

1382
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:07,139
we don't have the tools to really look

1383
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,838
at a drop of that tea under the

1384
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:11,279
microscope and see

1385
00:58:08,838 --> 00:58:13,380
whether or not we've just got a bunch of

1386
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,240
bacteria and no predators that would be

1387
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:18,059
the worst case scenario

1388
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,500
um or if we're if we're Brewing

1389
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:21,720
something that's a little more balanced

1390
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,858
so one thing that I'd encourage people

1391
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:25,318
to do

1392
00:58:22,858 --> 00:58:29,578
is create a what I would call a

1393
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:31,858
protozoan infusion this is a method that

1394
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:35,640
I've learned from the soil food web by

1395
00:58:31,858 --> 00:58:38,639
Dr Elaine Ingham and you you take a

1396
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:42,000
healthy leaves and a different kind of

1397
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:44,039
vegetation and put them down in a bucket

1398
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,619
with uh kind of something to weight them

1399
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:49,139
on top like a rock

1400
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:51,838
and you can add just the tiniest bit

1401
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:54,659
like a drop of honey and that's actually

1402
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:58,798
going to encourage some bacterial growth

1403
00:58:54,659 --> 00:59:02,039
but what occurs in tandem with that is a

1404
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:04,739
produce the the Predators will respond

1405
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:07,380
to that increase in the bacteria

1406
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:10,139
population and so

1407
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:13,559
um there I if I was doing this without a

1408
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:15,779
microscope I would I would go online and

1409
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:20,940
do some research and see if you can find

1410
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:23,640
the best time to use that kind of Brew

1411
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:25,980
because there's going to be a a peak

1412
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:28,139
period after you've encouraged the

1413
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,298
bacterial growth that the protozoa will

1414
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:32,879
have had a chance to respond to that and

1415
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:37,318
then you can use that as a useful way to

1416
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:39,960
introduce Predators into your ecosystem

1417
00:59:37,318 --> 00:59:42,179
um that's one thing that comes to mind a

1418
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:46,559
couple others are to just focus more

1419
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:48,659
heavily on your fungal foods and go

1420
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,440
really light little to no bacterial

1421
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:56,338
Foods as you're preparing your compost

1422
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:59,579
teas so again you can find some guidance

1423
00:59:56,338 --> 01:00:02,219
online but in general humic and fulvic

1424
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:06,420
acids are really useful for feeding

1425
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:08,399
fungi as our fish hydrolyzate and

1426
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:10,619
there's there's some others online that

1427
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,880
I've I've yet to try but I'm sure are

1428
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:13,980
just as viable

1429
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,858
I really like this

1430
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,240
um protozoa incubation technique that

1431
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:20,039
you just described I've not I've not

1432
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,858
come across that

1433
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:26,940
um and and I like the idea that

1434
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:29,219
I don't have to just make food available

1435
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:32,579
and hope for the best but that I can

1436
01:00:29,219 --> 01:00:34,500
actually incubate protozoa and make more

1437
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:36,180
of them and then pour them into the

1438
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,818
Container this sounds like something

1439
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:40,739
that I would want to do like any time

1440
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:43,259
I'd want to do it in the spring I'd want

1441
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:45,058
to do it like before flower when when

1442
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,880
the plants are working the hardest and

1443
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:49,260
then and then again at fall to keep

1444
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,298
every it seems like it's a good thing

1445
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:54,599
for all through the season yeah

1446
01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:56,400
certainly and I think any time that you

1447
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,920
really need a nutrient boost that's when

1448
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,660
I'd Focus the most on your Predators

1449
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,519
because that that's who's doing that job

1450
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:04,199
for you by feeding on the bacteria

1451
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:07,619
they're cycling nutrients to your plant

1452
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:09,838
so I think the the times and the growth

1453
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:13,500
cycle that you pointed out are are dead

1454
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:15,179
on interesting okay so um another thing

1455
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,858
that you mentioned when we started

1456
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:19,618
talking about like you know best

1457
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:21,659
amendments for pre pre-winter

1458
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:24,838
um you were talking about inoculants so

1459
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:26,699
would you consider this an inoculant or

1460
01:01:24,838 --> 01:01:28,558
or how were you using that word what do

1461
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:32,159
you think of as an inoculant because in

1462
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:34,680
my head this may be inoculating my soil

1463
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,779
with protozoa but I may not be using

1464
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:37,858
that um word in the proper scientific

1465
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,280
way

1466
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:44,400
yes I think in the case of the protozoa

1467
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,040
infusion that's certainly an inoculation

1468
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,500
technique you're trying to introduce a

1469
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:51,679
specific organism or group of organisms

1470
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,780
into the soil that's how I would Define

1471
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,699
inoculation

1472
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:59,160
and when I mentioned earlier that I

1473
01:01:56,699 --> 01:02:00,838
wouldn't be so focused on that again

1474
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:03,298
it's not that inoculation isn't

1475
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:06,480
happening with your compost tea it's

1476
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:08,759
more that your focus and intention and

1477
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,519
again relationship with what you're

1478
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,140
doing is thinking more critically about

1479
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:16,039
the foods you're putting into that tea

1480
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:18,598
rather than what you're necessarily

1481
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:21,599
growing and and um

1482
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:23,099
growing in population in that tea so in

1483
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,200
the springtime I'd be much more focused

1484
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:27,298
on looking at the samples from my

1485
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:30,000
compost tea and making sure I know how

1486
01:02:27,298 --> 01:02:31,798
much fungi is in there because if I and

1487
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,960
how much protozoa and

1488
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:36,780
Etc are in there because that would

1489
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,400
matter more to me come springtime due to

1490
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,859
all the nutrient cycling that I'm going

1491
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,740
to rely on for my plant growth but in

1492
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:46,380
the winter time I'm more concerned about

1493
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:48,959
feeding the microorganisms below ground

1494
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,460
and less concerned about what they're

1495
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,159
going to do for my plant because my

1496
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:55,019
plant's no longer there right on

1497
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:58,078
um right all right so then

1498
01:02:55,019 --> 01:03:00,059
so we've talked about the the mineral

1499
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,740
type amendments we've talked about

1500
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:07,798
adding uh complex uh brood compost teas

1501
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:13,019
so that or there's a an array a buffet

1502
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:14,219
of foods for our life forms in the soil

1503
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:16,619
since they're not going to be getting it

1504
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:18,899
from the plant and then and then this

1505
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:21,180
delightful protozoa infusion which I

1506
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,880
like want to make one immediately

1507
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:25,919
um and so so the last category that I

1508
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,740
want to talk about are

1509
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,680
um uh what kind of a role at this point

1510
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:33,659
would you think that natural farming

1511
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:36,598
fermentations like you know everybody's

1512
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:38,818
talking about Korean natural farming and

1513
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:42,599
you know fermented plant juices things

1514
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:44,400
like this that that we are making which

1515
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:46,859
are in a way

1516
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,079
um kind of like incubated

1517
01:03:46,858 --> 01:03:51,298
um nutrition and in some of them even

1518
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:52,619
incubated like hormones if we're if

1519
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:53,460
we're going to be using

1520
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:55,740
um

1521
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:57,420
you know like a fresh grown tips from

1522
01:03:55,739 --> 01:04:00,838
that we that we harvested in the spring

1523
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:02,760
or something like part of me thinks oh I

1524
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:06,179
should add some of that stuff in the

1525
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:08,460
fall to to keep some of that zesty life

1526
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:10,279
force in the soil but some of it is also

1527
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:13,380
me thinking

1528
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:16,140
it that's adding the wrong kind of

1529
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:18,059
encouragement at the wrong time of the

1530
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:20,940
Season that that's more of a spring

1531
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:24,900
thing and and I might not want to be

1532
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:27,480
using those types of ferments as a

1533
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,880
um going into fall root drench or

1534
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,039
something like that at this time of year

1535
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:36,180
so is there is there any role for that

1536
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:39,420
kind of a incubated fermentation

1537
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:42,298
I think you're you're on the right track

1538
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:44,099
with that like I wouldn't

1539
01:04:42,298 --> 01:04:47,159
again I don't think that there's

1540
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:50,940
anything that would go wrong necessarily

1541
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:52,379
by adding uh those fermented plant is it

1542
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:54,480
fermented plant juice that they call

1543
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,220
that yeah yeah

1544
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,099
um and and just to be clear I'm not

1545
01:04:56,219 --> 01:05:00,659
fully up to speed on knf methodologies

1546
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:02,280
I'm fascinated by them and I think

1547
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:05,639
there's a lot of

1548
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:08,280
um things in common in terms of what

1549
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:10,078
what we're interested in doing uh from a

1550
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:13,440
biological perspective whether you come

1551
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:15,599
from the the k f side the soil food

1552
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,679
website or you know there's there's any

1553
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,000
number

1554
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,980
um even if you're like really focused on

1555
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,099
mycorrhizae like we're all kind of

1556
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:25,260
generally interested in in similar

1557
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:28,619
things and so

1558
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:30,299
um I think with the what what I know

1559
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:33,000
about the fermented plant juice approach

1560
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:36,960
being more focused on those plant

1561
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,480
boosting signals that that would make

1562
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,059
the most sense to me in the context of

1563
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:45,000
the growth cycle when you need that kind

1564
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:47,160
of activity so it again it's it's not

1565
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,318
that you're doing you'd be doing much

1566
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:51,960
harm it's more like are you spending

1567
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:53,599
your time and energy producing a thing

1568
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,760
that's going to actually

1569
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,619
help the soil at this current state that

1570
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,359
it's in and I don't know that that would

1571
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:02,760
be the best use of your time is focusing

1572
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:05,519
on on those types of amendments right on

1573
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,780
that well said and that also discourages

1574
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:08,639
me because

1575
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:10,140
um I I have been hanging out with other

1576
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:11,578
folks and we've been talking about it

1577
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:13,019
and it's not uncommon for me to hear

1578
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:16,680
people say well

1579
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:19,980
I had some extra fpj in the fall and so

1580
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:22,098
I just put it on the pots and and

1581
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:25,940
that might actually it might be better

1582
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:29,099
to waste it or hold it for the spring

1583
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:31,139
instead of throwing it on the pots and

1584
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:33,780
kind of confusing the system at that

1585
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:35,818
point yeah because it could I I don't

1586
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:39,599
know I imagine that it could confuse the

1587
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:41,519
system if the microorganisms are

1588
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,579
receiving these

1589
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:46,619
um you know chemical signals from that

1590
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:47,880
were derived from a plant that was

1591
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:49,318
actively growing but they're not

1592
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,880
actually that they're not actually

1593
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:54,480
supporting an actively growing plant

1594
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,858
then it might kind of uh be unnecessary

1595
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,240
and

1596
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:59,639
um you know it's hard to know what's

1597
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:01,858
really going on you know without digging

1598
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:04,679
into some academic research if it's even

1599
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:07,920
been done on this kind of stuff but I

1600
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:09,960
think if you can preserve that Amendment

1601
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,159
and save it for spring that would be a

1602
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:15,900
much better use of that Amendment

1603
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,058
um this is totally conjecture but it

1604
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:21,119
could totally be the case that um the

1605
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:23,579
microbe life become aware of those

1606
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,858
chemical signals and then they think

1607
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:27,900
that oh there must be a plant around

1608
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:29,940
sure and so then they start looking for

1609
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:32,220
exudates and when when we don't want

1610
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:35,220
them looking for exudates we want them

1611
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:37,618
focusing on eating other other you know

1612
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:39,239
Predator prey relationship life forms

1613
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:40,440
it's like it's like when you go past

1614
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:42,058
somewhere and you smell somebody's

1615
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,559
barbecue but it's like you're not it's

1616
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:45,480
not your barbecue so you're not getting

1617
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:48,660
barbecue and now you're like just hungry

1618
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,798
and annoyed yeah right now now you have

1619
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:52,920
to go out of your way to go find

1620
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:57,719
barbecue yeah all right so so let's

1621
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:59,338
let's move on to uh top dress mulches so

1622
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:01,739
um uh

1623
01:07:59,338 --> 01:08:05,038
there are different mulches with

1624
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:06,838
different goals and to my best

1625
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,960
understanding

1626
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:13,980
um the the two big reasons we use them

1627
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:17,460
are number one to uh create some kind of

1628
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:19,439
warmth at the top of the container or on

1629
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,140
our field

1630
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:27,298
um over the winter and then and then

1631
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:29,640
also that as it breaks down it is uh

1632
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:32,460
biologically active and kind of like a

1633
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,199
slow drip of interesting nutrition into

1634
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:35,579
the soil

1635
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:39,318
um would you agree with both of those

1636
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:42,298
and would you add anything to that list

1637
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:45,480
I I think I would use the word

1638
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:49,039
insulation like I I you know it's it's

1639
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:51,539
really creating a barrier between the

1640
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:56,338
environment like the ambient

1641
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:58,920
temperatures and the soil Atmos or soil

1642
01:08:56,338 --> 01:09:00,960
sphere in the root Zone

1643
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,940
um and then yeah it's creating

1644
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,920
biologically active I'm

1645
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:06,479
I feel like

1646
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,460
um we might get into it but to answer

1647
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:11,459
your question directly I wouldn't add

1648
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:13,140
anything to that list at this time

1649
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,539
um

1650
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,338
we're going to talk about cover crops

1651
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:20,100
you know when we when we segue to the

1652
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:21,659
next topic so this time I'm talking more

1653
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:23,940
about

1654
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:26,399
um I guess I'll say not actively living

1655
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:30,000
plants and so

1656
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:33,119
um what are some of your favorite over

1657
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,119
winter mulches

1658
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:39,899
one word and that's aged I just want

1659
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:44,519
aged Mulch and if I can find much that

1660
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:48,259
is from my region as locally as possible

1661
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:51,060
that's ideal because in theory

1662
01:09:48,259 --> 01:09:52,039
they those

1663
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:54,719
um

1664
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:56,640
yeah indigenous microorganisms thank you

1665
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:59,520
yeah they'll they'll have the the

1666
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,079
organisms that can survive your your

1667
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,260
local environment

1668
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:08,939
um just colonized on their surfaces and

1669
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:11,699
I say aged because the younger The Mulch

1670
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:13,799
the more resistant it actually is to

1671
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:16,079
microbial activity which is not what we

1672
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,480
want so like in the Landscaping industry

1673
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:21,359
it's really common to use very young

1674
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:23,399
mulch to use cedar mulches or other

1675
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:27,059
mulches that have a lot of secondary

1676
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:29,158
metabolites that deter breakdown and

1677
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:32,159
that's for aesthetic reasons but of

1678
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:34,259
course here in cannabis we want to

1679
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:37,799
actually be eating the soil with our

1680
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:39,840
mulch so the more aged generally the

1681
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:43,440
better I'd say the minimum you'd want

1682
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:47,219
that mulch to have been kind of sitting

1683
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:49,979
somewhere as wood chips for a minimum a

1684
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:52,439
year ideally longer

1685
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:54,178
all right so I like that you know you

1686
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:56,039
kind of just systemically over the top

1687
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:58,679
said whatever your mulch is we want it

1688
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:00,840
to be old which I like because we all

1689
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:04,020
have access to different things

1690
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:07,679
depending on our bio region right and so

1691
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:09,300
so you want to use wood chips fine we

1692
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,880
want them to be old though you want to

1693
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:14,219
use Forest Duff fine we want it to be

1694
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,920
aged for stuff you want to use old grass

1695
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:18,779
clippings fine but we want them to be

1696
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,940
old so the the idea is what whatever

1697
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:24,479
that you've got

1698
01:11:20,939 --> 01:11:26,819
um is usable just make sure that it's

1699
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,019
matured enough so that it breaks down

1700
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:30,599
properly

1701
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:33,780
yeah and I think in the case of things

1702
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:36,320
that might break down faster than wood

1703
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:40,019
derived or or lignin

1704
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:42,179
based materials so as you mentioned the

1705
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:45,420
grass clippings like that you wouldn't

1706
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:48,179
want those to be aged a year at all

1707
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:50,640
um I think you could you could uh

1708
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:54,000
with something like grasses or any kind

1709
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,860
of like vegetative biomass that you chop

1710
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,960
down and kind of I've seen people do

1711
01:11:55,859 --> 01:12:01,559
this with like flail mowers the chop and

1712
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,539
drop method I think that's viable to

1713
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,820
just set it and leave it it's it's

1714
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:07,859
better than removing a lot of that

1715
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:10,679
material if it's already if it's already

1716
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:12,420
in place like if it's in C2 and you are

1717
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:14,640
chopping and dropping I think that's

1718
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,199
totally appropriate rather than the

1719
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,539
disturbance that would be caused if you

1720
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:21,238
were to remove that material and try to

1721
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:23,039
age it somewhere else now you you might

1722
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:24,839
decide to actually compost that material

1723
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:27,539
and that's a whole other thing but as

1724
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,779
far as a mulch purpose goes I think a

1725
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:33,479
chop and drop method is just as well

1726
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:36,899
when I have heard people talk about them

1727
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:40,079
using mulch to keep their containers uh

1728
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:42,000
warm over the over the winter

1729
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:44,399
um it's funny you mentioned earlier that

1730
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,859
it's it's it's used like kind of as an

1731
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:49,079
insulator and I'm like oh that makes

1732
01:12:46,859 --> 01:12:50,759
sense too but I always thought that the

1733
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:54,000
reason we were using it to air quotes

1734
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,880
keep our pots warm is because the mulch

1735
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,679
as it rots it's

1736
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,020
um it's warm right you know like a warm

1737
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:04,079
compost pile and I actually thought that

1738
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:06,600
it was that as it broke down it was

1739
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,399
creating a warmth like a heat Source at

1740
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,320
the top of the pot and now I'm

1741
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:14,879
understanding that it's really more

1742
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:16,799
about like being a like a a Band-Aid if

1743
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,900
you will on the on the wound where you

1744
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,119
removed the plant and you're kind of

1745
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:23,819
like sealing it up

1746
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:25,679
um what at what point is it too much of

1747
01:13:23,819 --> 01:13:27,779
a good thing because in the in the first

1748
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:32,279
set you were talking about

1749
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:34,859
um we we don't want to over seal our uh

1750
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:38,819
the tops of our pots right and so we

1751
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:41,880
wanted to be able to engage with the the

1752
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:45,359
atmosphere and the rain and the air to

1753
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:48,359
some degree but but we also want there

1754
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:51,658
to be like a nice thick layer so will

1755
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:55,139
you will you speak to I guess uh the

1756
01:13:51,658 --> 01:13:59,639
thickness of the layer and what kind of

1757
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:02,159
attributes we want our mulch to have so

1758
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:03,960
that things like water and air can go

1759
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,238
through it kind of talk to us about what

1760
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,460
what the attributes of a good mulch are

1761
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:10,859
so that when we look at what we have

1762
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:12,840
available to us where we live we can

1763
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:15,479
judge our mulches

1764
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:19,140
okay great okay so the first thing that

1765
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:22,259
comes to mind is the size of that

1766
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:25,920
material so if it's too large

1767
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:29,520
it it doesn't provide as much protection

1768
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:31,980
you might have large gaps for instance

1769
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,020
um I'm thinking of like maybe something

1770
01:14:31,979 --> 01:14:36,779
that's like really thick straw but you

1771
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,460
it's it's not very finely chopped and

1772
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:40,439
you you'd have

1773
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:42,420
um you'd have to put a little bit more

1774
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:46,158
of that material layered in order to

1775
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:46,158
really effectively mulch a space

1776
01:14:46,439 --> 01:14:50,639
um and then there's also

1777
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:52,799
um the the fact that you want this

1778
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,300
breaking down so like the thicker that

1779
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,820
material is

1780
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:59,640
um if it's really chunky wood chips for

1781
01:14:56,819 --> 01:15:02,158
example even if they've been aged

1782
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,320
um that might not be optimal you might

1783
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:06,479
want them to be I'm just kind of

1784
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:11,219
eyeballing things around the room right

1785
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:13,799
now but maybe uh two inches long by half

1786
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:16,679
an inch wide would be like the North

1787
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,659
Star and you know give or take an inch

1788
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:22,319
on either side but the the point is you

1789
01:15:18,658 --> 01:15:24,299
don't want bark essentially like four

1790
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:26,698
four inches long by three inches wide

1791
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:28,199
would probably be getting too too large

1792
01:15:26,698 --> 01:15:30,719
for the kind of mulch that we're

1793
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:33,779
interested in here

1794
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:37,859
um also avoiding the hydrophobic

1795
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:39,658
conditions so this still applies even

1796
01:15:37,859 --> 01:15:41,579
when you're mulching so we it's kind of

1797
01:15:39,658 --> 01:15:44,399
ironic because you mulch a soil surface

1798
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:47,760
to try to avoid evaporation loss as well

1799
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:49,799
maybe that's one that we can add to the

1800
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,860
the reasons for mulching is to avoid

1801
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:54,659
evaporation loss from the soil surface

1802
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:55,859
um among the other two which was

1803
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:59,879
insulation and keeping things

1804
01:15:55,859 --> 01:16:01,859
biologically active but uh the The Mulch

1805
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:04,980
layer itself can actually go hydrophobic

1806
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:07,198
if you really neglect it so making sure

1807
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:09,658
that it it is getting some amount of

1808
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:11,879
moisture so if there aren't any rains or

1809
01:16:09,658 --> 01:16:15,899
any precipitation that they're actually

1810
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:19,140
getting watered in some way because they

1811
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:20,839
really mulch layers really can compact

1812
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:25,260
similar to soil

1813
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:27,179
and provide a hydrophobic surface which

1814
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:28,679
can become problematic

1815
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:32,100
and then

1816
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:33,480
um let's see other features in mulch

1817
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,640
those are those are the two that are

1818
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:37,019
coming to mind a shingo so I'll kind of

1819
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,060
turn it over to you and see if you have

1820
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:40,440
any questions about that I do um I'm

1821
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,120
getting this picture hearing you

1822
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:44,219
describe how

1823
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:46,738
um we we don't want it too chunky but we

1824
01:16:44,219 --> 01:16:49,198
don't want it too fine it kind of

1825
01:16:46,738 --> 01:16:51,359
reminds me of of that uh that old

1826
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:54,539
example where where the the college

1827
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:57,119
professor holds up a jar with marbles

1828
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:58,800
and it says is this is this full and

1829
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:01,800
everybody goes yeah it's full and then

1830
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,199
and then and then he adds uh something

1831
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,760
smaller than Marbles and yeah and it

1832
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:07,738
fits in between he goes is it full now

1833
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,199
they're like yeah and then he adds water

1834
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:13,198
and you're like oh so so I'm kind of

1835
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:15,419
thinking that a blended mulch is is

1836
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:18,059
probably going to be our best practice

1837
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:20,640
where perhaps you have

1838
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:23,760
um some semi-chunky things that are age

1839
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:26,640
wood chips and then some and then some

1840
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:29,699
smaller things that maybe is Forest Duff

1841
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,860
and leaflet Twitter and then maybe

1842
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:34,259
um you know something else like like a

1843
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:36,899
powdered biomass and so that when you

1844
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:40,020
put when you put it all together

1845
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:42,599
um in a ratio that that looks good to

1846
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,340
you you have you you have some of each

1847
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:47,579
you can kind of blend those in a way

1848
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:50,219
where there is enough room for airflow

1849
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:52,500
and for water to get in and it's not a

1850
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:55,439
sealed thing but

1851
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:58,260
um but it's by blending two or three

1852
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:01,259
mulch things together that you actually

1853
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:03,600
come up with the optimum mulch for where

1854
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:06,960
you live I like that I like that because

1855
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:09,420
it Harkens back to variability you know

1856
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:12,300
supporting biodiversity so I think

1857
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:14,760
that's definitely again I think of these

1858
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:17,219
things as either good better best or

1859
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,619
having a North star and just aiming for

1860
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:21,359
that don't beat yourself up if you can't

1861
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:23,698
get your hands on you know four

1862
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:27,479
different feedstocks for your magical

1863
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:29,639
mulch concoction but but the more more

1864
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:32,939
variability the the better in general

1865
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:37,020
and that that does apply to this the

1866
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:39,178
size and the source of the mulch yeah

1867
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:41,159
all right so before we go on to cover

1868
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:42,179
crop let's let's talk about what I did

1869
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:43,679
this year

1870
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:45,119
um uh get a little get a little free

1871
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,699
Consulting out of you

1872
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,260
um so I I did something I thought about

1873
01:18:47,698 --> 01:18:50,698
it a little but I didn't think of it a

1874
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:52,440
lot and I probably should have waited

1875
01:18:50,698 --> 01:18:55,559
until after

1876
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:58,439
um we recorded this episode but I had

1877
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,640
access to a whole lot of

1878
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:00,479
um

1879
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:04,199
um

1880
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:07,500
a CBD hemp biomass this year where where

1881
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:09,479
they just take the whole plant and they

1882
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,340
um they essentially wood shipped the

1883
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:14,399
whole thing together I don't know why

1884
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:16,260
they did this exactly but um they had it

1885
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:19,019
and they they offered it to me for free

1886
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:20,340
and I said great so so I'll take it and

1887
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,860
and I'll figure out some kind of

1888
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,539
fertilizer for it or something but then

1889
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:26,399
I noticed that

1890
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:29,279
um you know I didn't have anything set

1891
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:33,179
aside to mulch the top of my pots going

1892
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:38,579
into fall and so I put about an inch

1893
01:19:33,179 --> 01:19:42,539
layer of this uh pretty finely powdered

1894
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:45,119
essentially chewed up cannabis like amp

1895
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:47,880
plants and I just put like an inch layer

1896
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,920
on there because in my thoughts were

1897
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,679
um it would it would insulate it it

1898
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,840
would let the water through

1899
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:57,600
um if there's any snow that we get this

1900
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:01,079
year it'll protect the soil from that

1901
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:03,480
cold shock and then as it rotted oh and

1902
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:04,859
this was this was aged this is this this

1903
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:09,178
material was probably about three years

1904
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:11,279
old and so and so at as it breaks down

1905
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:12,600
since I already know it's a hemp plant

1906
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:15,479
it's probably going to be packed with

1907
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:19,199
the nutrition that my plants want next

1908
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:20,459
year and so so great

1909
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:22,799
um except for the fact that it wasn't

1910
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:25,679
you know from my Island and so the the

1911
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,480
imos won't be accurate I thought that it

1912
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,539
was going to be pretty good but now I'm

1913
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:34,859
starting to think that because it was I

1914
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:37,619
put a an inch of fine granular powder on

1915
01:20:34,859 --> 01:20:39,539
top that it might actually get wet and

1916
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:42,840
kind of like push to together and

1917
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:44,899
actually create an oxygen seal and I

1918
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,460
might actually want to like remove that

1919
01:20:44,899 --> 01:20:49,198
what are your thoughts well there's so

1920
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:52,020
much there okay I'm like writing down

1921
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:53,939
notes as you're talking about that so

1922
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:56,159
the first thing that comes to mind and I

1923
01:20:53,939 --> 01:20:59,219
just want to mention it in case it

1924
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:01,139
applies to anyone listening is that this

1925
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:03,060
material

1926
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:05,699
um it's on but until you said that it

1927
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:07,080
had been aged my original concern was

1928
01:21:05,698 --> 01:21:12,000
that it would still have a lot of

1929
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:14,640
nitrogen in it and that that's just of

1930
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:19,140
concern because it would start actively

1931
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:22,679
decomposing or composting really on top

1932
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:24,060
of this soil and generating heat so when

1933
01:21:22,679 --> 01:21:27,300
you were talking about earlier your

1934
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:31,260
perception of mulch actually creating

1935
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:34,079
heat the only time that that I would

1936
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:35,640
expect to see that happening is if the

1937
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,100
the material that you're mulching with

1938
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,780
has a high nitrogen content and it and

1939
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:42,420
effectively what's happening is it's

1940
01:21:39,779 --> 01:21:44,340
being broken down by a lot of bacteria

1941
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:46,619
and so you're having a bacterial Bloom

1942
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,940
and not so it's generating the Heat and

1943
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:49,859
going back to what we talked about

1944
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:52,619
earlier that's not necessarily in the

1945
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:56,819
best interest of our plants right and in

1946
01:21:52,619 --> 01:22:00,000
fact in a really worst case scenario if

1947
01:21:56,819 --> 01:22:03,059
you had if you use a high nitrogen mulch

1948
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,920
uh product too thick you could actually

1949
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:08,159
create a little anaerobic environment

1950
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:10,079
and have again very worst case scenario

1951
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:12,658
you could have like a combustion issue a

1952
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:14,399
crop up because what happens in an

1953
01:22:12,658 --> 01:22:17,039
anaerobic environment is a lot of those

1954
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:21,420
those microbes are generating alcohols

1955
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:23,100
and compounds that it will once oxygen

1956
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:24,899
does get back into that system can

1957
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:26,400
become flammable at certain temperatures

1958
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:28,679
so

1959
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,960
um so again just like kind of using a

1960
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:33,899
North star and a South Star if you will

1961
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:37,079
um that that would be like just a word

1962
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:41,579
of caution I don't I wouldn't use high

1963
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:44,340
nitrogen materials as a mulch with the

1964
01:22:41,579 --> 01:22:46,619
exception of that chop and drop method

1965
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,699
now when I say chop and drop I'm

1966
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:52,559
thinking of it in terms of

1967
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:55,460
green vegetative biomass that you're

1968
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:59,100
dropping on top of a mulched an already

1969
01:22:55,460 --> 01:23:02,880
wood chipped type of mulch so it's kind

1970
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:05,219
of a layered effect so you have a carbon

1971
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,739
it's not in direct contact with the soil

1972
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:09,960
and I think that I just want to clarify

1973
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:10,500
that that would probably be

1974
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,380
um

1975
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:15,359
not the best case of a mulch situation

1976
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,880
if you had like a high nitrogen

1977
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:19,738
vegetative plant decomposing directly on

1978
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,719
top of the soil got it and that that

1979
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:23,939
Harkens back to the the one guide rule

1980
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:26,698
you said which was aged you know so yes

1981
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:28,979
yeah yes if I follow yeah and so so yeah

1982
01:23:26,698 --> 01:23:31,198
there's some instances where maybe

1983
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:33,419
um maybe you can get away with it yeah

1984
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:35,000
not being aged but just be mindful that

1985
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:37,319
it's not actively

1986
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,658
composting on top of your soil and so in

1987
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:40,738
this case you've dealt with all in

1988
01:23:39,658 --> 01:23:42,119
theory you know I don't know what

1989
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:43,678
happened during those three years but

1990
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:46,439
you've dealt with a lot of the nitrogen

1991
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:48,779
in that case and I imagine any kind of

1992
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:50,399
resins or things that would create a

1993
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:51,019
hydrophobic

1994
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,299
um

1995
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:57,780
you know seal from a a chemical

1996
01:23:54,300 --> 01:24:01,560
perspective but now the concern is the

1997
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:05,519
fineness of this Mulch and just like in

1998
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:07,860
clay in clay soils that become compacted

1999
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:10,020
it's all those platelets that line up

2000
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:11,158
really snugly together and create this

2001
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,960
seal

2002
01:24:11,158 --> 01:24:15,179
um in in the soil and create compaction

2003
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,480
layers and so that might be happening

2004
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:22,679
with a really finely chopped source of

2005
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:24,779
mulch and in that case I think if you've

2006
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:26,520
put you said you put it on about one

2007
01:24:24,779 --> 01:24:30,179
inch yeah

2008
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:34,140
I think you could maybe gently mix in a

2009
01:24:30,179 --> 01:24:36,239
chunkier mulch Source instead of

2010
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:38,520
I mean and you know you're you're there

2011
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:41,158
with all the context in person so you

2012
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:42,000
you know how bad it is or isn't but if

2013
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:45,420
it's

2014
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,819
um able to kind of be moved around and

2015
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:50,179
judged a bit if you will then I would

2016
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:53,460
just I would just add in some chunkier

2017
01:24:50,179 --> 01:24:57,300
Mulch and maybe something a little more

2018
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:59,760
carbon rich but just as aged and uh just

2019
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:03,239
to add some of that variability right on

2020
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:06,119
good uh thank you for that um as far as

2021
01:25:03,238 --> 01:25:08,158
how things age

2022
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:10,679
um do things have to be interacting with

2023
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:13,679
the environment to age or does it simply

2024
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:16,560
need time to go by so the contrast I'm

2025
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:18,539
making is somebody who's got a pile of

2026
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,120
wood chips in the in the you know corner

2027
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:23,880
of their yard and they're getting rained

2028
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:26,099
on and uh you know warmed up by the Sun

2029
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:28,859
and you know they are they are aging and

2030
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:31,260
breaking down versus

2031
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:33,779
um for example this this biomass that I

2032
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:36,960
was referring to that um it had just

2033
01:25:33,779 --> 01:25:39,300
been sitting in plastic bins in a

2034
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,380
shipping container at this hemp farm for

2035
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,760
three years and they're like we need

2036
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:44,119
space will you just take this stuff and

2037
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:47,640
get rid of it and so I did

2038
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:50,479
can something air quotes age in a

2039
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:54,840
plastic bin not exposed to the elements

2040
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:56,479
time is passing but biology may not be

2041
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:00,480
happening

2042
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:03,658
this would be a matter of moisture

2043
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:07,559
mostly and then also when was that

2044
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:09,359
material harvested before being mulch so

2045
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:12,360
I'll kind of walk you through my thought

2046
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:15,179
process on that the first thing is

2047
01:26:12,359 --> 01:26:17,579
whenever it's harvested if it's if it's

2048
01:26:15,179 --> 01:26:20,699
a green if it's in a green vegetative

2049
01:26:17,579 --> 01:26:23,719
state as opposed to you know and and

2050
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:26,819
field AG you have a lot of crops that

2051
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:28,020
send all their sugars down out through

2052
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:31,259
the roots and then the above ground

2053
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:34,920
parts of the plants become this like you

2054
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:36,539
know Brown like dormant state and it's

2055
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:38,460
no longer photosynthesizing it's really

2056
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:41,158
no longer living above ground

2057
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:44,100
so that is a carbon-rich source and if

2058
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:45,539
you were to harvest that material I mean

2059
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,980
I assume this would happen with a

2060
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:48,359
cannabis plant right you could just

2061
01:26:46,979 --> 01:26:49,678
leave it in the I don't think people

2062
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:51,299
really often do this but if you left it

2063
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,460
in the ground you left it in your

2064
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,400
container and let it die back and then

2065
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:59,039
you come and chop it and mulch it that

2066
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:02,099
is that is going to be more carbon rich

2067
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:03,420
and far less of concern from the

2068
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,699
nitrogen perspective that we were

2069
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:08,039
talking about but if you harvested it

2070
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:10,979
when it was green and then chopped it up

2071
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:13,198
you'd really have to dry that material

2072
01:27:10,979 --> 01:27:15,539
this is where moisture comes in you'd

2073
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,638
have to dry it before storing it in

2074
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:20,939
plastic bins so that because if you were

2075
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:22,739
to just uh you know chop it when it's

2076
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:24,779
green and then mulch it while it's green

2077
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:27,299
and then put it in a plastic bin even if

2078
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:29,880
it had a lid on or lid off of it whether

2079
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:32,820
it had a lid on or off it would probably

2080
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:35,159
be too moist in that volume and start

2081
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:37,019
getting funky and you'd start losing the

2082
01:27:35,158 --> 01:27:38,279
night the nitrogen

2083
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,900
um in that material because it's

2084
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:42,359
actively breaking down and it'd probably

2085
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:45,839
be doing it in a pretty stinky way which

2086
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:47,219
is often anaerobic so

2087
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,520
um you'd really want to dry that

2088
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:53,520
material on a tarp or something and then

2089
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:57,199
you can put it in your your bins and

2090
01:27:53,520 --> 01:28:00,480
save it but it's not it's no longer

2091
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:02,819
Aging in terms of decomposing anymore

2092
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:05,218
and sometimes that's desired like I do

2093
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:06,380
this whenever I want to save a high

2094
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:09,300
nitrogen

2095
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:11,639
material for a future compost pile that

2096
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:13,679
I'm not yet ready to build but I want to

2097
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:15,900
make sure that it actually maintains its

2098
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,880
high nitrogen value and the only way to

2099
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:20,759
do that is to dry that material before

2100
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:23,819
storing it and if you don't you just

2101
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:26,699
lose all that nitrogen and then it would

2102
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:28,738
it would uh become anaerobic and

2103
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:30,000
problematic in that way so I know that

2104
01:28:28,738 --> 01:28:32,399
was a lot of information so I'm going to

2105
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,279
check in right on

2106
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:37,259
um uh this is really interesting I've

2107
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:39,719
never actually thought about mulches as

2108
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:42,119
as much as we have really dug into them

2109
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:44,880
today and I just I just looked at our

2110
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:47,579
timer we've done almost almost an hour

2111
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:50,880
second set like essentially on mulches

2112
01:28:47,579 --> 01:28:54,000
and yeah and so um I'm glad that like

2113
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:57,359
you know we really the goal of this was

2114
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,520
really to get people to understand

2115
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:02,039
um how to think about mulches so that

2116
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,360
people can use whatever they have near

2117
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:04,979
them right

2118
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:06,960
um because we don't we certainly don't

2119
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:08,939
want people to like purchase stuff and

2120
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,800
ship in their mulch like there's mulch

2121
01:29:08,939 --> 01:29:13,259
all around us unless you're living in a

2122
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,179
city and then and then maybe still then

2123
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:16,500
um but I I think that

2124
01:29:15,179 --> 01:29:18,960
um

2125
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:21,300
we have effectively gone through mulches

2126
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:24,779
that so people can think about what do

2127
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:28,320
they want in it how am I going to age it

2128
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:30,119
how am I going to apply it and so this

2129
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:33,059
kind of like system of thinking through

2130
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:35,279
it can be applied to wherever folks are

2131
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,960
so so I think I think that uh even

2132
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:38,519
though it went longer than I thought we

2133
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,980
were going to we definitely hit the mark

2134
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,840
so that's a win yeah okay good all right

2135
01:29:40,979 --> 01:29:45,000
so um what I think I'm gonna do though

2136
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:47,400
let's uh let's move um talking about

2137
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,439
cover crop to the third set and and wrap

2138
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:51,238
up this set right now and go to

2139
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:53,339
Commercial and then and then we'll pick

2140
01:29:51,238 --> 01:29:55,678
up with uh cover crop

2141
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:57,659
um uh when we come back so

2142
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:59,579
um uh you are listening to shaping fire

2143
01:29:57,658 --> 01:30:02,479
and my guest today is soil biologist

2144
01:29:59,579 --> 01:30:02,479
Andy Marsh

2145
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:08,339
for years organic cultivators have been

2146
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,260
looking for a peat moss replacement peat

2147
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:12,000
moss has long been the go-to soil

2148
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:14,159
amendment for water retention and

2149
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,859
container growing but organic Growers

2150
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:19,259
are recognizing now that peat moss is an

2151
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:22,319
unsustainable resource and the mining of

2152
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:25,079
peat bogs destroys Wetland habitats and

2153
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:27,059
releases sequestered carbon but peat

2154
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:30,000
moss works so well that many have

2155
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:32,340
continued to use it now there is finally

2156
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,800
a revolutionary replacement for peat

2157
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:37,020
moss that provides better benefits while

2158
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:40,380
being a sustainable choice

2159
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:42,659
pit Moss sounds and acts like peat moss

2160
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:44,940
but instead of being mined from fragile

2161
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:46,979
ecosystems is actually made from

2162
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:49,138
upcycled organic paper and cardboard

2163
01:30:46,979 --> 01:30:51,658
headed for landfills

2164
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:53,639
pit Moss is excellent at retaining water

2165
01:30:51,658 --> 01:30:55,679
in your substrate and creating air

2166
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:58,800

2167

01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:07,799
carefully and locally sourced pittmoss

2171
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:10,800
is the result of decades-long research

2172
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:13,139
into the use of recycled paper fibers

2173
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,179
pittmoss is lightweight and easy to use

2174
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:16,800
and pit Moss is an earth so it won't

2175

2176

one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

2190
01:31:56,819 --> 01:32:01,079
growing is so valued by Farmers is

2191
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:03,119
because the mycelium networks in the

2192
01:32:01,079 --> 01:32:05,639
soil remain established from year to

2193
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:07,380
year and we know these fungal networks

2194
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:09,659
are essential because they are the

2195
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:11,940
nutrient super highways that extend far

2196
01:32:09,658 --> 01:32:14,519
and wide in the substrate to feed your

2197
01:32:11,939 --> 01:32:16,919
plants the trouble with growing in New

2198
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,139
Living soils or Blended cocoa substrates

2199
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:21,539
is that it takes most of the plant's

2200
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:23,000
life just to create these mycelium

2201
01:32:21,539 --> 01:32:26,039

dynomico endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

2203

eating a wider array of nutrients faster

2205
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:35,698

welcome back you are listening to

shapingfire I am your host shangelos and

2293
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:57,899
my guest today is soil biologist Andy

2294
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,940
Marsh so here we are with the big finish

2295
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:01,920
we're going to start off by talking

2296
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:04,019
about cover crops that we bumped from

2297
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,980
set to and then we're going to talk

2298
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:07,679
about

2299
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:09,500
um uh good strategies for for waking up

2300
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:12,779
your pots in the spring

2301
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:15,539
so that you can preserve all your gains

2302
01:36:12,779 --> 01:36:17,819
from the prior year so so Andy when it

2303
01:36:15,539 --> 01:36:19,859
comes to cover crops it seems that there

2304
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:23,039
we kind of need to make a choice about

2305
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:26,880
whether or not we want to do a mulch or

2306
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:30,960
a cover crop because the mulch would

2307
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:34,440
then be on top of the cover crop and if

2308
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,359
we have the mulch on top We're Not

2309
01:36:34,439 --> 01:36:38,460
Really Gonna I don't think going to

2310
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:41,099
plant the cover crop into the mulch so

2311
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:43,020
it really is a you got to pick one right

2312
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:45,179
I think it kind of depends it kind of

2313
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:47,520
depends on your cover crop and how it

2314
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:49,679
like its morphology because something

2315
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,000
really delicate and low growing I agree

2316
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:54,600
with you you probably wouldn't want to

2317
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,698
double up on those two or really I just

2318
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,960
encourage like a light mulching in that

2319
01:36:56,698 --> 01:37:00,779
case

2320
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:02,939
um but I think you can I think I think

2321
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:05,819
mulching in general even if you're

2322
01:37:02,939 --> 01:37:08,339
light-handed about it is always a good

2323
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:12,719
practice and that you can you can do so

2324
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:14,520
effectively with your cover crop so so

2325
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:16,739
if you're doing something that's really

2326
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:19,199
really short

2327
01:37:16,738 --> 01:37:20,819
um you'd have to use a lighter hand but

2328
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:22,738
if you did something that was like a

2329
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:24,479
bigger Plant say for example like a

2330
01:37:22,738 --> 01:37:26,459
while it's not my favorite a lot of

2331
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:29,039
people really like red clover

2332
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:33,300
um you could potentially start your red

2333
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:36,300
clover and once it has grown above the

2334
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:37,619
tops of your containers then go and add

2335
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,980
a mulch

2336
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:42,539
um beneath the red clover and so then

2337
01:37:40,979 --> 01:37:44,638
that way you're having both

2338
01:37:42,539 --> 01:37:46,679
yeah that way you're having both and in

2339
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,539
some cases depending on your mulch you

2340
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:51,719
could get away with mulching lightly

2341
01:37:48,539 --> 01:37:53,880
before that cover crop germinates as

2342
01:37:51,719 --> 01:37:56,639
long as it's light enough and they're

2343
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:58,319
they're able to get the microclimate

2344
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:59,520
they need to germinate

2345
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:01,920
um you might find that you can get away

2346
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:04,080
with that so the way that the way that I

2347
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:07,920
think about cover crops is that it's a

2348
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:11,399
really intimate exercise with your

2349
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:15,060
cultivation it's a it's a very

2350
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:18,899
um specific practice for you within the

2351
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:23,100
context of your particular cultivation

2352
01:38:18,899 --> 01:38:25,198
practice okay so it it's an exercise and

2353
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:27,840
understanding like critically thinking

2354
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:30,599
and then researching plants that might

2355
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,639
make sense for your specific context

2356
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,739
I like that idea that it's that it's

2357
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:38,159
something intimate and and it's very

2358
01:38:34,738 --> 01:38:40,198
much to your your kind of growing style

2359
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:41,819
and your growing preferences for example

2360
01:38:40,198 --> 01:38:44,039
one of the reasons that I don't

2361
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:46,859
personally like red clover

2362
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:51,300
um is because it grows up into the lower

2363
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:53,819
branches of my cannabis plants and so um

2364
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:56,400
so I personally don't use it but but

2365
01:38:53,819 --> 01:38:59,759
people who aren't growing in you know

2366
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:02,219
smallish containers like I am where I've

2367
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:05,159
traditionally been in in seven gallon

2368
01:39:02,219 --> 01:39:07,500
containers but moved up to 20 versus

2369
01:39:05,158 --> 01:39:10,859
some of the regenerative farms in

2370
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:11,760
California that are using 300 gallon

2371
01:39:10,859 --> 01:39:14,039
um

2372
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:16,860
grow bags well they've got they've got

2373
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:19,560
lots of room for red clover in a big bag

2374
01:39:16,859 --> 01:39:23,219
that size whereas for me I need more of

2375
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,840
a a petite uh cover crop because there's

2376
01:39:23,219 --> 01:39:28,560
there's just not a lot of surface area

2377
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:30,960
in a in a 7 to 20 gallon bag exactly

2378
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:32,639
yeah I agree with you so let's talk

2379
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,319
about the the things that we're hoping

2380
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,199
the cover crop

2381
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,639
um uh is going to do for us so the one

2382
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:40,859
that you've you one that you mentioned

2383
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:44,340
earlier in the set is that

2384
01:39:40,859 --> 01:39:48,179
um it helps keep the rhizosphere alive

2385
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:51,119
because uh it is a plant and it is

2386
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:52,980
feeding the microbes through its root

2387
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:54,719
structure so I would put that probably

2388
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:57,599
at the top of the list of of the good

2389
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:59,340
thing we're wanting for it to do

2390
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,659
um the second a second thing is

2391
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:04,560
something we talk about on the show a

2392
01:40:00,658 --> 01:40:07,799
lot which is it helps the the top of the

2393
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:10,139
soil from going hydrophobic because each

2394
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:13,260
one of those little

2395
01:40:10,139 --> 01:40:18,179
um stems that are going into the soil

2396
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:19,679
are providing a way for water to get

2397
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:21,779
into the soil and create these like

2398
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:25,199
little Tunnels for them to get down into

2399
01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:26,819
the rhizosphere and then the third one

2400
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:28,859
that we talk a lot about the show is

2401
01:40:26,819 --> 01:40:31,679
that if if you if it happens to be a

2402
01:40:28,859 --> 01:40:33,719
cover crop with a canopy there's a

2403
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:36,060
there's a space between the top of the

2404
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:39,480
soil and the and the canopy of the cover

2405
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:43,620
crop which creates its own kind of Bio

2406
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:46,919
region and can trap moisture and be a

2407
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:48,960
home for uh uh you know insects and

2408
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:50,460
others that live on top of the soil so

2409
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,039
they you know you can have a more active

2410
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:55,260
food web over the winter

2411
01:40:53,039 --> 01:40:57,000
um so those are the three things that I

2412
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:58,739
most think about but I bet you've got

2413
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,319
some more so what what are other good

2414
01:40:58,738 --> 01:41:03,479
reasons to have a cover crop yeah I love

2415
01:41:01,319 --> 01:41:06,299
that last one I think of it as like a

2416
01:41:03,479 --> 01:41:10,339
habitat just like you described

2417
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:14,159
I would add that the cover crop can also

2418
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:16,860
provide additional nutrients into the

2419
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:18,539
rhizosphere and not just through the

2420
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:21,719
exudates that are feeding the microbes

2421
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:24,119
but in other ways so like your legumes

2422
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:26,639
for example anything that's able to fix

2423
01:41:24,119 --> 01:41:29,760
nitrogen is a really strong example of

2424
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:32,359
this but there's other plants that will

2425
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:36,539
be able to bring about

2426
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:38,399
more calcium or maybe maybe taking up

2427
01:41:36,539 --> 01:41:40,380
something that you're you actually have

2428
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:44,219
too too much nutrient and you actually

2429
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:46,219
want to remove that excess through a

2430
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:48,480
cover crop that would kind of fall under

2431
01:41:46,219 --> 01:41:50,880
phytoremediation and cover crops can be

2432
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:54,118
really useful for that so that would be

2433
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:56,159
the only thing that I'd add to your list

2434
01:41:54,118 --> 01:41:58,319
there you had a great list

2435
01:41:56,158 --> 01:41:59,939
um would you just explain for folks who

2436
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:02,158
are are like you know they're listening

2437
01:41:59,939 --> 01:42:03,839
to this episode because this is all new

2438
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:05,819
to them would you just explain nitrogen

2439
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,400
fixing what that goal is

2440
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:10,380
short oh gosh I love this topic so much

2441
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:12,779
so you're gonna have to keep me

2442
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:16,980
keep me concise okay all right but but

2443
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:20,639
in general uh nitrogen fixing plants are

2444
01:42:16,979 --> 01:42:22,678
a miracle to us because nitrogen the

2445
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:26,639
only way to get nitrogen

2446
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:29,158
into even just into biology in general

2447
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:31,618
including you and me so first of all

2448
01:42:29,158 --> 01:42:34,079
nitrogen is the backbone of amino acids

2449
01:42:31,618 --> 01:42:37,079
and proteins we all every living thing

2450
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:40,019
requires nitrogen and

2451
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:44,279
the only way that nitrogen gets into

2452
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:46,320
life forms is from from the atmospheric

2453
01:42:44,279 --> 01:42:48,539
nitrogen going through some kind of

2454
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:50,880
process in the soil and getting into our

2455
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:54,539
food web okay so

2456
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:57,300
um nitrogen it has a triple bond it's an

2457
01:42:54,539 --> 01:42:59,698
N2 molecule atmospheric nitrogen is so

2458
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:01,440
that means one nitrogen atom is

2459
01:42:59,698 --> 01:43:04,019
connected to another through a triple

2460
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:07,379
bond and it's really really difficult to

2461
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:10,619
separate the two to then allow it to

2462
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:13,020
become something like a a nitrate and be

2463
01:43:10,618 --> 01:43:14,519
taken up into plants and so what's

2464
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:17,460
really cool is that these nitrogen

2465
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:19,100
fixing plants like legumes as well as

2466
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:22,219
some free living

2467
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:25,320
organisms that do nitrogen fixing

2468
01:43:22,219 --> 01:43:27,600
outside of plants entirely is that

2469
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:30,719
they've found a way to break that Bond

2470
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:33,000
and start this the cycling of nitrogen

2471
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:36,239
into the system

2472
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:39,479
and so by using these plans it's

2473
01:43:36,238 --> 01:43:42,959
essentially capturing wild nitrogen and

2474
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:45,539
and packing it into your soil so that

2475
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:49,500
your plants can use it next summer yes

2476
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:52,139
exactly fabulous so um all right so so

2477
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:53,340
that's probably enough on cover crops

2478
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:56,279
there

2479
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:57,659
um so let's let's move on to what was

2480
01:43:56,279 --> 01:43:59,698
going to be the start of set three

2481
01:43:57,658 --> 01:44:01,319
before we we bumped cover crops over

2482
01:43:59,698 --> 01:44:03,299
which was I was going to start with this

2483
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:05,460
very dramatic question

2484
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:09,239
um let's talk about worst case scenarios

2485
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:10,920
that um that we want to avoid with our

2486
01:44:09,238 --> 01:44:13,379
containers and

2487
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:16,800
um I could really only think of two

2488
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:19,079
which would be number one your container

2489
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,639
freezing solid

2490
01:44:19,079 --> 01:44:23,100
um because I don't know this for sure

2491
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:26,880
but I would think that

2492
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:29,940
um you know unlike the the ground which

2493
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:32,639
will probably not freeze solid because

2494
01:44:29,939 --> 01:44:36,059
of the ambient warmth that that the

2495
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:38,819
Earth has as a container could actually

2496
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:41,219
freeze solid to the point where I'm

2497
01:44:38,819 --> 01:44:44,460
guessing it could it could wipe out huge

2498
01:44:41,219 --> 01:44:45,920
swaths of of the microbes

2499
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:49,279
um is that true

2500
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:54,060
yeah definitely I mean the microbes have

2501
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:56,939
water in them and under freezing

2502
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:59,280
conditions they would crit you know

2503
01:44:56,939 --> 01:45:01,678
those water molecules would freeze and

2504
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,779
effectively kill them so

2505
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:06,118
um that that would be bad news to have

2506
01:45:03,779 --> 01:45:07,698
to have all the water in your pot that

2507
01:45:06,118 --> 01:45:10,500
essentially freeze

2508
01:45:07,698 --> 01:45:11,819
and then the second thing I I considered

2509
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:14,219
was that

2510
01:45:11,819 --> 01:45:15,960
um you kind of want to be aware of the

2511
01:45:14,219 --> 01:45:19,500
containers to make sure nothing gets

2512
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:22,139
deposited in the on the top of the

2513
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:24,960
container that might cause uh the

2514
01:45:22,139 --> 01:45:26,819
biology be thrown out of balance

2515
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,500
um and I'm not like entirely certain

2516
01:45:26,819 --> 01:45:30,059
what that would be like I was I was

2517
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:32,340
trying to think of like you know you

2518
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:34,500
know passing animals feces like you know

2519
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:35,880
a dog or something like that but you

2520
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,800
know I I would I would tend to think

2521
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,300
that the pot would be able to to deal

2522
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:41,340
with that very likely but then I was

2523
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:44,279
thinking about like you know one of the

2524
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:46,739
farm hands laying there you know a can

2525
01:45:44,279 --> 01:45:48,479
of soda that's partially Rank and then

2526
01:45:46,738 --> 01:45:50,579
it gets knocked over by the wind and now

2527
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:53,698
suddenly you've got half of a Diet Coke

2528
01:45:50,579 --> 01:45:57,300
in your soil and so so you probably just

2529
01:45:53,698 --> 01:45:58,618
want to like like just be aware and you

2530
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:01,380
know occasionally walk your field and

2531
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:03,539
just make sure that that

2532
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:06,179
you know chaos has not arrived on the

2533
01:46:03,539 --> 01:46:08,340
top of your containers yeah when you

2534
01:46:06,179 --> 01:46:11,039
mentioned that just now I was thinking

2535
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:13,679
of somebody tossing out the last little

2536
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:15,300
bit of coffee onto their plants thinking

2537
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:18,239
like oh here's some nitrogen and it's

2538
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:21,000
like okay that's that might be fine here

2539
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:23,039
and there in really small quantities but

2540
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,500
if you if it's always the same plant

2541
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:26,819
that's closest to wherever you're

2542
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,920
standing in the field at the time that

2543
01:46:26,819 --> 01:46:31,259
you finish your coffee like if it can

2544
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:33,658
become a problem so just you know being

2545
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:35,400
mindful yeah

2546
01:46:33,658 --> 01:46:36,899
um what do you think about the idea of

2547
01:46:35,399 --> 01:46:38,279
Home Growers because like this is this

2548
01:46:36,899 --> 01:46:39,539
isn't something that scales well

2549
01:46:38,279 --> 01:46:41,340
probably

2550
01:46:39,539 --> 01:46:44,760
um but I've got a neighbor who actually

2551
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:47,880
uh has got a hole dug in there on their

2552
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:49,079
yard and they do uh five twenties every

2553
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:51,539
year

2554
01:46:49,079 --> 01:46:55,198
um and they they put their 20 gallon

2555
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:57,000
pots like they bury them and so

2556
01:46:55,198 --> 01:46:59,460
um in their in their thought the

2557
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,060
geothermal temperature will keep the

2558
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:06,319
rhizosphere in the pot like safe and it

2559
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:09,600
also allows the migration into the pot

2560
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:12,238
of other diverse life forms that are

2561
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:16,380
already in the soil because the the oil

2562
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:18,000
the hoil the hole that he dug is deep

2563
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:19,679
enough that

2564
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,600
um he's got about I don't know maybe

2565
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:25,859
eight or ten inches of soil that he puts

2566
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:27,900
on top of them and so he by his theory

2567
01:47:25,859 --> 01:47:29,579
it's actually he says he says it's

2568
01:47:27,899 --> 01:47:32,339
inviting

2569
01:47:29,579 --> 01:47:35,939
all of these

2570
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:37,560
um soil inhabitants from his yard to

2571
01:47:35,939 --> 01:47:39,779
like come on in come on into the

2572
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:41,159
Container for the the winter there's all

2573
01:47:39,779 --> 01:47:43,198
sorts of like interesting Foods here

2574
01:47:41,158 --> 01:47:44,519
that you don't normally get and so he

2575
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:47,339
attracts all these things and then when

2576
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:49,260
he pulls them out in the spring

2577
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:50,760
um they don't have to wake up they're

2578
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:53,579
they've kind of been awake all winter

2579
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:55,260
and they've got more biodiversity what

2580
01:47:53,579 --> 01:47:57,658
do you think of that that's cool I I

2581
01:47:55,260 --> 01:48:01,020
like I like the idea of that for sure I

2582
01:47:57,658 --> 01:48:03,238
think it all it all is sound to me and

2583
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:06,239
just hearing about it and I think

2584
01:48:03,238 --> 01:48:08,279
there's yeah the the only reason that

2585
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:10,738
that would work is because he's taken

2586
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:13,979
good care of his pots and created a

2587
01:48:10,738 --> 01:48:18,118
habitat for organisms to be interested

2588
01:48:13,979 --> 01:48:21,178
in enough in uh joining right so right

2589
01:48:18,118 --> 01:48:23,819
the invitation is good yes yes I think

2590
01:48:21,179 --> 01:48:25,880
that's really neat and the fact that

2591
01:48:23,819 --> 01:48:28,559
um it's buried and able to

2592
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:31,079
stay warm and much warmer than if it

2593
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:33,060
were exposed above ground is um I mean

2594
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:34,800
it sounds labor intensive to dig such a

2595
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:36,539
large hole but you know if you have the

2596
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:39,900
means and

2597
01:48:36,539 --> 01:48:42,000
um I say go for it yeah he's he he's a

2598
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:43,799
retired person with a lot of time on his

2599
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,738
hands and he loves he loves to Tinker

2600
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:48,840
and experiment so I like going over

2601
01:48:46,738 --> 01:48:51,000
there all sorts of odd odd

2602
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,920
labor-intensive things so good neighbor

2603
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,719
to have yeah totally

2604
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:56,219
um so earlier in the show we talked

2605
01:48:54,719 --> 01:49:00,779
quite a bit about

2606
01:48:56,219 --> 01:49:01,439
um how to devise a fall compost tea

2607
01:49:00,779 --> 01:49:04,319
um

2608
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:06,059
once it gets really cold and things are

2609
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:07,319
you know things are frosting over and

2610
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:10,199
maybe we're starting to get you know

2611
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:13,500
nights in the 30s and stuff

2612
01:49:10,198 --> 01:49:16,039
um I'm guessing we want to stop adding

2613
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:19,979
compost teas because we don't want to be

2614
01:49:16,039 --> 01:49:22,920
packing our containers with water once

2615
01:49:19,979 --> 01:49:26,158
they start getting cold because that

2616
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:28,079
extra water will expand and could

2617
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:30,420
actually cause damage to the pot so I'm

2618
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:33,059
thinking we we want to do what you know

2619
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:37,079
the the big compost tea before the frost

2620
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:38,880
and then don't add any more water or is

2621
01:49:37,079 --> 01:49:40,618
the position like actually making sure

2622
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,300
they get watered over the winter is good

2623
01:49:40,618 --> 01:49:44,039
because they're less likely to cyst up

2624
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:46,320
what are your thoughts on that

2625
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:49,019
I think you want to be mindful of

2626
01:49:46,319 --> 01:49:54,479
moisture levels because if they get too

2627
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:57,780
low you will have some loss in your your

2628
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:59,879
microbial populations but

2629
01:49:57,779 --> 01:50:01,500
um you know I'm holding space for the

2630
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,600
idea of it freezing through which is

2631
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:06,380
hard for a Texan like me to really

2632
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:09,179
empathize with because I I've never

2633
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:11,460
experienced it firsthand but I I'm sure

2634
01:50:09,179 --> 01:50:12,779
that happens up north

2635
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:16,618
um and it's probably when you least

2636
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:19,500
expect it so I I'd say trying to find

2637
01:50:16,618 --> 01:50:22,319
some kind of middle ground and if that

2638
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:25,198
means keeping things pretty moist on the

2639
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:26,819
front end but as those temps get colder

2640
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:30,059
and colder and there's a greater risk of

2641
01:50:26,819 --> 01:50:32,639
freezing then yeah that you back off and

2642
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:34,159
you make sure that priority number one

2643
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:37,139
is that you're not

2644
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:40,439
complicating any of your equipment

2645
01:50:37,139 --> 01:50:42,359
um by freezing and also not killing off

2646
01:50:40,439 --> 01:50:44,638
any of the organisms that are freezing

2647
01:50:42,359 --> 01:50:46,139
it's kind of like are you going to lose

2648
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,300
them to freezing or are you going to

2649
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:51,659
lose them to them not getting enough

2650
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:54,659
water and it's your job to be in tune

2651
01:50:51,658 --> 01:50:57,059
enough with when you choose to pull

2652
01:50:54,658 --> 01:50:59,339
which lever and that's probably a big

2653
01:50:57,060 --> 01:51:01,080
bio region question as you pointed out

2654
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:04,199
in my head

2655
01:51:01,079 --> 01:51:05,639
um you know pots never run out of water

2656
01:51:04,198 --> 01:51:09,299
because I live in the Pacific Northwest

2657
01:51:05,639 --> 01:51:11,279
and my winter is all rain but if you

2658
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:13,679
happen to live in the part of the

2659
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:15,779
country where your Winters are cold and

2660
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:18,359
dry well then you know you actually

2661
01:51:15,779 --> 01:51:20,519
might have dehydration issues so it's

2662
01:51:18,359 --> 01:51:22,339
good to it's good to make sure that you

2663
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:25,080
are cultivating for where you live

2664
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:28,079
certainly and you could just as another

2665
01:51:25,079 --> 01:51:32,158
option you could consider

2666
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:34,079
uh removing the soil from your pots I

2667
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:37,319
don't know if you tell me if this is a

2668
01:51:34,079 --> 01:51:39,059
feasible idea but having that in contact

2669
01:51:37,319 --> 01:51:41,158
with soil whether you're slightly

2670
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:43,260
burying it or just kind of mounding it

2671
01:51:41,158 --> 01:51:45,779
somewhere in a really thoughtful space

2672
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:48,420
Maybe behind a wind break or an area

2673
01:51:45,779 --> 01:51:50,779
that's like pretty well protected but

2674
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:54,000
you'd you'd be able to

2675
01:51:50,779 --> 01:51:58,259
again have migration occurring in that

2676
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:00,899
scenario and have a better chance of the

2677
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:03,119
the microbes surviving in in some

2678
01:52:00,899 --> 01:52:05,939
capacity and less concerns about

2679
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:07,859
freezing the only downside to this is

2680
01:52:05,939 --> 01:52:09,419
the amount of disturbance so then when

2681
01:52:07,859 --> 01:52:12,658
you come in in the spring you're

2682
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:15,239
disturbing that soil in order to put the

2683
01:52:12,658 --> 01:52:18,420
soil into the pots and and that's not

2684
01:52:15,238 --> 01:52:21,299
ideal but it's also again comparing that

2685
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:24,359
reality to what happens when you leave

2686
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:26,820
that pot exposed all winter long and I'd

2687
01:52:24,359 --> 01:52:29,399
say that that disturbance might actually

2688
01:52:26,819 --> 01:52:30,719
be the lesser of 2 two evils there yeah

2689
01:52:29,399 --> 01:52:32,339
that's interesting when you when you

2690
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:33,658
first suggested that my thought was oh

2691
01:52:32,340 --> 01:52:36,779
my gosh it's just going to wreck the

2692
01:52:33,658 --> 01:52:38,158
mycelium networks but if let's say you

2693
01:52:36,779 --> 01:52:39,840
live somewhere that gets really cold

2694
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:42,238
like um

2695
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:44,940
like I imagine Montana to be okay right

2696
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:47,158
like I've seen enough movies where you

2697
01:52:44,939 --> 01:52:49,859
know nature just seems to freeze solid

2698
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:53,339
and and so if you've got extreme

2699
01:52:49,859 --> 01:52:56,579
situations like that a a 10 gallon

2700
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:59,159
container on your deck it probably

2701
01:52:56,579 --> 01:53:01,559
doesn't have a chance right and so and

2702
01:52:59,158 --> 01:53:03,658
so if you were to make a pile of all you

2703
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:05,520
know 10 gallon containers of this just

2704
01:53:03,658 --> 01:53:07,198
the soil yeah you'll beat up the

2705
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,060
mycelium networks but at least they'll

2706
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:11,819
all they'll all essentially be huddled

2707
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:13,619
together for the cold season yeah I

2708
01:53:11,819 --> 01:53:15,359
agree it's it's again just kind of

2709
01:53:13,618 --> 01:53:17,759
thinking critically about these things

2710
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:19,799
and comparing one option to another and

2711
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:21,360
not getting too dogmatic about it just

2712
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:22,739
because you saw someone on Tick Tock

2713
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:24,479
swearing by their method of

2714
01:53:22,738 --> 01:53:26,099
overwintering their pots doesn't mean

2715
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:28,859
it's the best method for you yeah right

2716
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:30,780
on um all right so uh let's go into this

2717
01:53:28,859 --> 01:53:33,960
uh last area which is let's talk about

2718
01:53:30,779 --> 01:53:36,300
waking up the pots uh in the spring so

2719
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:37,560
let's assume that we we did all the

2720
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:41,579
things right

2721
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:43,400
um we did a a late C season fungally

2722
01:53:41,579 --> 01:53:47,300
dominant

2723
01:53:43,399 --> 01:53:51,238
compost tea and then we also did a

2724
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:55,260
protozoa infusion in the fall and then

2725
01:53:51,238 --> 01:53:56,939
we had a really nicely Blended top Mulch

2726
01:53:55,260 --> 01:54:00,119
and then we were growing a cover crop

2727
01:53:56,939 --> 01:54:02,879
that was helping keep the microbes fed

2728
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:06,059
over winter and so now we find ourselves

2729
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,039
in the spring and

2730
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:11,880
um

2731
01:54:07,039 --> 01:54:14,100
we want to transition our pot back to a

2732
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:17,819
position where it's ready for us to

2733
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:20,280
bring in our clones or our seed starts

2734
01:54:17,819 --> 01:54:22,079
and and we want them to just like

2735
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:25,618
immediately get into this wonderful

2736
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:28,439
relationship uh and reform a rhizosphere

2737
01:54:25,618 --> 01:54:32,219
and take off so what what hints would

2738
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:33,719
you give us to ease that transition for

2739
01:54:32,219 --> 01:54:37,139
the microbes from where they're getting

2740
01:54:33,719 --> 01:54:39,179
their food and the plant to be warmly

2741
01:54:37,139 --> 01:54:42,539
embraced by the soil

2742
01:54:39,179 --> 01:54:45,139
um yeah so so it's important at this

2743
01:54:42,539 --> 01:54:47,939
point that you're not providing too many

2744
01:54:45,139 --> 01:54:51,300
synthetic nutrients I mean

2745
01:54:47,939 --> 01:54:52,859
really we if we're thinking biologically

2746
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:55,079
we don't really want to be using many

2747
01:54:52,859 --> 01:54:56,759
synthetic nutrients at all

2748
01:54:55,079 --> 01:54:58,399
um because they can kill microbes but

2749
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:00,900
especially during this early

2750
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:03,979
establishment phase it can be tempting

2751
01:55:00,899 --> 01:55:08,460
and so I just want to note that

2752
01:55:03,979 --> 01:55:11,039
when we when we provide those nutrients

2753
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:13,980
directly to the plant it's disrupting

2754
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:16,618
that engagement between the microbes and

2755
01:55:13,979 --> 01:55:18,539
the root oxidates the the plant is only

2756
01:55:16,618 --> 01:55:21,779
going to generate those root oxidates if

2757
01:55:18,539 --> 01:55:24,779
it has needs that need to be met by the

2758
01:55:21,779 --> 01:55:27,479
microbes and so that's why I just want

2759
01:55:24,779 --> 01:55:30,000
to caution against getting too attempted

2760
01:55:27,479 --> 01:55:32,158
by providing some kind of synthetic

2761
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:37,139
nutrient boost and instead focusing on

2762
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:39,779
yeah maximizing the inoculation and your

2763
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:42,420
job is to make introductions you're

2764
01:55:39,779 --> 01:55:44,399
bringing in the microbes so that they

2765
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:47,158
can start responding to those exudates

2766
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:48,839
so similarly you don't necessarily need

2767
01:55:47,158 --> 01:55:50,698
to be all that focused I'm providing a

2768
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:52,260
lot of microbial Foods because we want

2769
01:55:50,698 --> 01:55:53,759
them to be getting their Foods now from

2770
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:55,079
the plant and start creating that

2771
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:58,020
relationship

2772
01:55:55,079 --> 01:56:00,719
so would that make a suggestion that we

2773
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:02,820
we don't want to do a heavy spring

2774
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:05,520
compost tea

2775
01:56:02,819 --> 01:56:07,859
I think I think you can do you

2776
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,540
definitely want to do a compost tea but

2777
01:56:07,859 --> 01:56:11,279
this time be more focused on the

2778
01:56:09,539 --> 01:56:15,060
inoculation and so this is where

2779
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:16,698
extracts might actually be become of

2780
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:21,539
Greater interest to you

2781
01:56:16,698 --> 01:56:24,859
doing more frequent extracts rather than

2782
01:56:21,539 --> 01:56:28,139
big batches of like

2783
01:56:24,859 --> 01:56:29,099
nutrient-rich tea and and I say this in

2784
01:56:28,139 --> 01:56:31,920
terms of

2785
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:34,860
maybe you know you can certainly do a t

2786
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:36,899
but don't go don't go too heavy-handed

2787
01:56:34,859 --> 01:56:39,539
on it because your goal is if you find

2788
01:56:36,899 --> 01:56:41,879
yourself tempted to be adding tea

2789
01:56:39,539 --> 01:56:44,519
um super regularly in the spring maybe

2790
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:47,279
start alternating with an extract and

2791
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:48,540
again an extract is just the microbes

2792
01:56:47,279 --> 01:56:50,340
you're not adding Foods you're not

2793
01:56:48,539 --> 01:56:53,519
having a brewing cycle

2794
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:56,760
um it's just less dense yeah

2795
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:59,820
um uh Jeff lowenfell's uh says that

2796
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:01,920
early in the season you you want your

2797
01:56:59,819 --> 01:57:03,899
microbes to be you don't want to make

2798
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:06,118
them lazy you don't want to make it too

2799
01:57:03,899 --> 01:57:08,638
easy for them you want them to get to

2800
01:57:06,118 --> 01:57:10,198
work and that sounds like what we're

2801
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:12,420
describing here

2802
01:57:10,198 --> 01:57:13,859
um same with the plants yeah we want

2803
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:16,020
them building

2804
01:57:13,859 --> 01:57:18,658
um not not laying around because there's

2805
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:21,000
all this easy free food exactly yeah

2806
01:57:18,658 --> 01:57:23,579
that's that's the right on right on

2807
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,380
um is is there anything that we need to

2808
01:57:23,579 --> 01:57:27,960
do or is there anything that we can do

2809
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:31,920
that can support them changing the food

2810
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:35,219
source uh from the compost tees to back

2811
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:37,980
to the the roots exudates and such or or

2812
01:57:35,219 --> 01:57:40,198
does that just they probably prefer the

2813
01:57:37,979 --> 01:57:41,879
exudates and so as soon as we put a

2814
01:57:40,198 --> 01:57:44,519
plant in there

2815
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,260
um it will they will naturally just

2816
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:48,119
switch on their own you know because

2817
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:50,699
we're just trying to decrease as much

2818
01:57:48,118 --> 01:57:53,460
transition time as possible right right

2819
01:57:50,698 --> 01:57:55,079
and and there is a level of patience

2820
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:57,719
that's always required here because

2821
01:57:55,079 --> 01:58:00,059
you're taking a very young plant that's

2822
01:57:57,719 --> 01:58:02,520
not yet pumping out lots and lots of

2823
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:05,460
exudates and so

2824
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:08,159
um because of its limited capacity to

2825
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:10,198
photosynthesize it has a small surface

2826
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:13,198
area to do so

2827
01:58:10,198 --> 01:58:15,719
um so I think just tapering off and

2828
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:16,979
knowing that like leading up to planting

2829
01:58:15,719 --> 01:58:19,679
day

2830
01:58:16,979 --> 01:58:21,959
um to go really light-handed like little

2831
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:23,699
to no microbial foods are being added

2832
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:25,319
during that time you did that work in

2833
01:58:23,698 --> 01:58:28,979
the winter to get your microbes through

2834
01:58:25,319 --> 01:58:30,960
winter and have food to sustain them but

2835
01:58:28,979 --> 01:58:35,218
but now as you're transitioning into

2836
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:37,920
planting you're you're going to back off

2837
01:58:35,219 --> 01:58:41,099
in terms of feeding the the micro Foods

2838
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:43,079
again so that when that plant gets in

2839
01:58:41,099 --> 01:58:45,060
there they can start creating their

2840
01:58:43,079 --> 01:58:46,500
relationship and once it gets to a

2841
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:47,420
certain stage

2842
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:49,618
um

2843
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:52,079
there shouldn't be a limiting factor

2844
01:58:49,618 --> 01:58:54,539
anymore so you know you might in in

2845
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:56,760
terms of using my microscope to look at

2846
01:58:54,539 --> 01:58:59,579
these things of what's really going on

2847
01:58:56,760 --> 01:59:01,920
in the root Zone you might see like a

2848
01:58:59,579 --> 01:59:04,319
drop in your biomass during a phase

2849
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:07,139
where you've put a young plant in into

2850
01:59:04,319 --> 01:59:09,380
the Container but it it kind of turns a

2851
01:59:07,139 --> 01:59:11,579
corner at some point once it's really

2852
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:14,219
photosynthesizing and pumping out those

2853
01:59:11,579 --> 01:59:17,819
sugars to feed the microbes it's funny

2854
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:19,980
because it's um it's fall and I am not

2855
01:59:17,819 --> 01:59:21,899
thinking about you know growing right

2856
01:59:19,979 --> 01:59:24,479
now right now I'm feeling tired from the

2857
01:59:21,899 --> 01:59:27,719
summer and I'm glad I'm not like you

2858
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:30,178
know farming right now however you know

2859
01:59:27,719 --> 01:59:32,340
you talking about these like healthy

2860
01:59:30,179 --> 01:59:34,920
thriving pots and these young plants I'm

2861
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:36,360
like ooh like start the season start I

2862
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:38,579
love I love thinking about and I'm like

2863
01:59:36,359 --> 01:59:40,920
whoa whoa whoa whoa we got we got five

2864
01:59:38,579 --> 01:59:43,260
months man like chill out like we've got

2865
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:45,420
a while but um you know there is

2866
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:48,060
something inherently exciting about

2867
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:50,460
thinking ahead to the a fresh season

2868
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:52,020
every year you'll you'll look like you

2869
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:53,520
have imaginary plant friends if you're

2870
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:55,980
out there attending to your pots with no

2871
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:58,080
plants in them but I think that's just

2872
01:59:55,979 --> 02:00:00,059
as well right on

2873
01:59:58,079 --> 02:00:02,340
um well Andy thank you so much for being

2874
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:05,099
a guest on shaping fire this is um I

2875
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:09,420
I've always been interested on things

2876
02:00:05,099 --> 02:00:12,239
that I can do to get a a jump start on

2877
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:14,039
the on you know next year but I I'm

2878
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:16,439
usually I'm thinking about well let's

2879
02:00:14,039 --> 02:00:18,300
let's make an fpj let's make a

2880
02:00:16,439 --> 02:00:22,138
fertilizer let's make sure that the

2881
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:27,000
compost is going and um the idea that I

2882
02:00:22,139 --> 02:00:29,819
can pay attention and use intention with

2883
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,859
the soil that is in my containers and

2884
02:00:29,819 --> 02:00:34,198
the Earth so that

2885
02:00:31,859 --> 02:00:37,500
um I don't have to put in as much work

2886
02:00:34,198 --> 02:00:39,238
every spring to get the micro machine

2887
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:41,819
pumping along

2888
02:00:39,238 --> 02:00:45,259
um I'm glad to have you know a better

2889
02:00:41,819 --> 02:00:48,960
understanding of how to do that as well

2890
02:00:45,260 --> 02:00:51,300
yeah I think all of these things too the

2891
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,980
the cover crops the mulching the adding

2892
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:55,320
of the microbial foods and the

2893
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:57,359
inoculation the biology itself they're

2894
02:00:55,319 --> 02:01:00,000
all contributing to so many different

2895
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:02,098
areas that benefit us so it's not just

2896
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,658
about plant nutrients it's also about

2897
02:01:02,099 --> 02:01:05,960
that soil structure we talked about

2898
02:01:03,658 --> 02:01:08,759
earlier and I I think that's really

2899
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:10,859
undervalued or it kind of goes

2900
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:13,980
unrecognized a lot of times come

2901
02:01:10,859 --> 02:01:16,618
springtime just how valuable that it can

2902
02:01:13,979 --> 02:01:19,259
be to have a pot that's been nurtured

2903
02:01:16,618 --> 02:01:22,920
and has a really healthy structure

2904
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:25,619
that's prepared to become home to that

2905
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:28,139
young plant it's kind of like moving

2906
02:01:25,618 --> 02:01:30,479
into a neighborhood that has a good vibe

2907
02:01:28,139 --> 02:01:32,520
and lots of friendly neighbors as

2908
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:33,359
opposed to something that's you know

2909
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:36,599
neighborhood that's been really

2910
02:01:33,359 --> 02:01:38,639
neglected and and desolate wow that's a

2911
02:01:36,599 --> 02:01:40,679
great example excellent right on well

2912
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:42,779
let's let's let's all get to making good

2913
02:01:40,679 --> 02:01:45,000
neighborhoods for our uh for our plants

2914
02:01:42,779 --> 02:01:46,859
to move into in the spring so thank you

2915
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,118
so much Andy I really enjoyed our

2916
02:01:46,859 --> 02:01:50,939
conversation

2917
02:01:48,118 --> 02:01:53,939
me too thanks for having me if you want

2918
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:54,960
to find out more information about Andy

2919
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:57,299
Marsh

2920
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:59,698
um there are two great places to go

2921
02:01:57,300 --> 02:02:04,440
um first uh you can go to her Instagram

2922
02:01:59,698 --> 02:02:05,879
which is at soil is sexy and uh her

2923
02:02:04,439 --> 02:02:08,698
Instagram's a lot of fun not only do

2924
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:11,039
will you learn lots of

2925
02:02:08,698 --> 02:02:12,779
um you know good best practices for

2926
02:02:11,039 --> 02:02:14,399
taking care of your soil

2927
02:02:12,779 --> 02:02:18,840
