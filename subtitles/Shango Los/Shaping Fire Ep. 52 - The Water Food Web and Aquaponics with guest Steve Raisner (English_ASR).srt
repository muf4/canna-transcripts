2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:10,349
if you listen the shaping fire show

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:12,239
pretty often chances are that you're at

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,849
least somewhat familiar with the soil

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,948
food web that is the term I use pretty

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,690
universally to describe the transfer of

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,330
energy between species in the ecosystem

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,779
of soil we're talking about all the

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:27,028
plants bacteria fungi microbes protozoa

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,640
and nematodes and arthropods and then

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:31,528
birds and other animals they exist from

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,689
the tiny guys deep in the soil all the

13
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:36,269
way up to where the soil stops and our

14
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,920
feet start those of us who study and

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,780
create living soil have become pretty

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,670
familiar with the soil food web by

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,890
learning from thought leaders like dr.

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,450
Elaine Ingham and Jeff Lowen Fels and

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,030
other folks it's actually one of my

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,350
favorite things doesn't even think about

21
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,820
imagine my astonishment when I learned

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,100
that there was another food web

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,640
mirroring the one that we have for soil

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,590
but taking place in water of course in

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,689
retrospect that there would be a water

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,550
food web is pretty obvious but I had

27
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,530
never given it much thought and the idea

28
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,840
that there was a twin to my favorite

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,079
topic of living soil made me very very

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,140
happy the water food web consists of

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,509
phytoplankton algae zooplankton small

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,640
fish crustaceans and all the way up to

33
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,180
bigger fish and corals and eventually

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,180
whales

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,070
the water food web describes how all of

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,220
these life forms exchange energy and

37
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,868
compete and form a complex web similar

38
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,009
in many ways the ones that we know for

39
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:33,269
living soil and it's totally badass if

40
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,129
you want to learn about cannabis health

41
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,420

and I'm your host Shang golos today my

65
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:24,370
guest is cannabis aquaponics expert

66
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,890
Steve Reznor Steve designs and builds

67
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,938
commercial scale aquaponic systems he

68
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:29,649
builds them for lots of different

69
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:32,138
purposes but he especially enjoys

70
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,150
building them for cannabis Steve is a

71
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,549
sought-after speaker on the range of

72
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,188
cannabis growing topics and shares his

73
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,650
knowledge via his potent ponics podcast

74
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:43,688
and in person through classes he hosts

75
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,908
he's also built a very educational

76
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:47,799
youtube channel also called potent

77
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:49,688
ponics with a range of content from

78
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:51,879
instructional videos to Google Hangouts

79
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:54,699
with topic experts today we're gonna

80
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:57,429
talk about the water food web welcome to

81
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:59,438
the show Steve thanks for having me

82
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,909
Shengo yeah so glad that you could peel

83
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:04,388
off a little your time there in Oklahoma

84
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:06,598
off your project too to chat with us so

85
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:10,689
let's get right into it and you know

86
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,658
aquaponics and the water food web while

87
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:15,128
it is the center of your world and

88
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,769
certainly it's increasing in popularity

89
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,348
I think that it's kind of on the fringe

90
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:23,709
of most cannabis people's experience and

91
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:25,869
so let's start off by giving people like

92
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,598
a context of about what we're even gonna

93
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,359
be talking about today so you know

94
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,328
talking about it at a global level if we

95
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,879
were talking about the the water food

96
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:39,459
web we would be talking about saltwater

97
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,500
and freshwater and estuaries and and

98
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,509
everything from phytoplankton all the

99
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,878
way up to whales and things like that

100
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:47,978
but but today I'm figuring that it's

101
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,388
probably better for us to talk about the

102
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:54,069
water food web as it applies to

103
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,829
aquaponics your specialty so so let's

104
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:59,258
start with this word aquaponics the

105
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,989
words aquaponics hydroponics and

106
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:05,078
aquaculture are thrown around and I

107
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,870
think incorrectly used synonymously back

108
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,120
and forth would you kind of like give us

109
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,199
some depth on how to use these words and

110
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,209
what we're actually going to be talking

111
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,459
about today

112
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,439
sure so I guess traditionally

113
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:20,500
aquaculture would be the growing and

114
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,418
raising a fish for the mainly food

115
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,639
purposes but sometimes other utility

116
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:27,769
purposes they also use them for skin

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,840
grafts and even filtering wines and

118
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:33,109
years they used fish bladders and things

119
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,788
like that and then you also use so for

120
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,288
hydroponics you know everyone's pretty

121
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:39,709
familiar with hydroponics listens to

122
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:41,449
your show using mineralized salts in an

123
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,878
aquatic environment and just delivering

124
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,098
a non soil or soil this environment

125
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,900
traditionally most of the time but not

126
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:50,949
all the time in hydroponics are doing so

127
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:53,779
in a sterile or as sterile as possible

128
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:56,478
aquatic environment and then you have

129
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:59,299
aquaponics where we use fish and fish

130
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,699
waste similar from an aquaculture system

131
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,939
to raise fish and a hydroponic system

132
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:06,560
although they are different chemically

133
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:08,329
than traditional hydroponics in many

134
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,430
different ways because of the

135
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:12,740
mineralization process and how much more

136
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,389
we rely on a much wider range of

137
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,189
microbes than they would in a hydroponic

138
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,990
system sometimes ones that can cause

139
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:19,459
problems in a hydroponic system actually

140
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,560
are very beneficial in an aquaponic

141
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:24,620
system if they're maintained in proper

142
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,168
population levels you know in the right

143
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,120
balance so so today so saying that a

144
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:31,879
different way hydroponics is going to be

145
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,439
more kind of you know bottled salt based

146
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,149
a plus B kind of stuff which may not be

147
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,199
organically natural but they get the job

148
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:43,598
done feeding the plants to a degree

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,538
aquaponics is going to be way more

150
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:49,668
analog chunky organic natural which is

151
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:52,699
great for the plants but if you tried to

152
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:54,589
use those solutions in hydroponics all

153
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:58,370
your sprayers if we get clogged with

154
00:05:54,589 --> 00:06:01,098
nature right absolutely yeah so things

155
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,598
like really fine sprayers you know fine

156
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:05,060
water lines all of them would have

157
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:07,579
clogged with bacterial mats and other

158
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,829
issues that you know anyone that's run

159
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:13,550
those even without biologics has run

160
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:16,189
into those those issues as well so from

161
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,650
listening to you speak before I've heard

162
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:20,180
you talk about the split biome and

163
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:22,370
that's probably a really great place for

164
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,098
us to start because when I first started

165
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:28,519
doing my research for this interview

166
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:32,180
today I actually thought that that

167
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,609
aquaponics had the cannabis plant bare

168
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,588
root in you like in my head was

169
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,009
essentially an aquarium so it was like

170
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:40,848
the roots dangling in water and I'm all

171
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,259
like how do

172
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:44,449
they how do they breathe you know

173
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,158
because when it comes to soil we don't

174
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,689
want to overwater because it'll choke

175
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:50,329
out the plant and like I don't know how

176
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:52,699
these how these roots are gonna live in

177
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:54,769
water but then but then you know I hear

178
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:58,098
you say split biome and I'm like oh wait

179
00:06:54,769 --> 00:07:01,218
a minute it's both water and either a

180
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:02,509
soil or maybe an inert substrate so so

181
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:05,209
would you describe that and kind of

182
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,619
explain the idea behind it sure so what

183
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:09,348
you were first describing as well as

184
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:12,229
referred to as DWC or deep water culture

185
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:13,308
which is bare root and water and where

186
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:15,498
there's a lot of people that have done

187
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:18,080
tests in the past different aquaponics

188
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:20,990
companies and they it simply doesn't

189
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,359
allow the proper flour structure and

190
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,598
proper plant structure and and no

191
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,278
density as well as a few other issues

192
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,928
with the plants so we use a method

193
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:31,908
called dual root zone planting where we

194
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:34,368
have pots where they have the top half

195
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:36,110
is soil and a layer of burlap and the

196
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:38,300
bottom half is either lava rock or

197
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:43,278
hydrogen and this allows us to have

198
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:45,050
terrestrial microbes mycorrhizae and etc

199
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:47,118
and different you know terrestrial

200
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,829
microbes they all of you guys have you

201
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:50,809
know familiar with from from soil and

202
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:53,269
the soil food web and I'm sure you've

203
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:55,699
had other amazing guests on talking

204
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:57,649
about that and then we have the aquatic

205
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,809
microbiome where we have all these

206
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:01,189
aquatic microbes that can mineralize all

207
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,289
these different nutrients in their own

208
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,269
ways some very similarly to the ones in

209
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:07,128
soil but they do so in radically

210
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:10,218
different ways chemically and what this

211
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,588
allows us to do is stimulate the immune

212
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:17,178
system of the plant in a way that is is

213
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:19,519
radically broader than at just a soil or

214
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:22,908
just an aquatic environment there was a

215
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,978
study done by NASA a few years ago where

216
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:26,528
NASA was trying to do a broad microbial

217
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:28,399
study of aquatic microbes and

218
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:30,468
terrestrial microbes so they could

219
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,568
figure out okay well if we go offworld

220
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,729
what microbe groups do we need to bring

221
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:36,139
with us if we're gonna grow a garden you

222
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,379
know what do we need a bottle and bring

223
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:41,688
with us to make food and crops and

224
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:43,068
whatever else they need to grow what

225
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,809
they found was when they did the

226
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:48,769
commercial aquaponics facilities around

227
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:51,469
North America I did over 50 of them none

228
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:53,480
of them at the same microbe webs across

229
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,889
any of them I believe it was no more

230
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,749
than seven percent

231
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:02,230
molarity is across microbes across all

232
00:08:56,749 --> 00:09:04,399
these different ones sorry so you have a

233
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,778
what that means is that you know you

234
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,688
have radically different microbes

235
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:10,399
species that are making iron available

236
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:13,039
or silica available or nitrogen

237
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,259
available or potassium or phosphorus etc

238
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,308
and and none of them are the same and

239
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,289
all of them had kind of different

240
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:21,469
processes for it so it's just really

241
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:22,849
cool that you have such biodiversity but

242
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,589
what that means is that we can get

243
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,928
increased terpene expression increased

244
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:29,689
cannabinoid expression and our plants as

245
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:31,249
well as accelerated growth rate is what

246
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:33,469
that translate institute is for his

247
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:35,480
bottom line for the grower all right

248
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,869
there's a lot there to unpack so the

249
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,259
first thing I want to unpack there is is

250
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:44,689
where the path is for the roots so if if

251
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:47,808
we've got the cannabis plant planted in

252
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:49,219
soil and so we are getting a more you

253
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:51,469
know traditional what we think about is

254
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,298
the is the the rhizosphere and living

255
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,910
soil and the plant is growing down

256
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:57,858
through that and then and then we'll get

257
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:59,928
to the burlap a bit in a minute and then

258
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:02,689
rocks so so to a certain degree this

259
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:04,639
sounds like building a traditional you

260
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:06,918
know pot with the different horizons

261
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,579
like you'd get in the Earth's crust so I

262
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:14,928
get that so at what point does the

263
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:18,289
cannabis plants roots hit the water are

264
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:22,068
the roots going down to the water table

265
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:26,629
so that the the ends of the roots are

266
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:30,438
hitting this this specialty aquaponic

267
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:33,319
water with fish in it or is this just a

268
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:38,409
regular pot that's being watered from

269
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:43,159
the top with water from an exterior tank

270
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:44,808
so so after day three or four once we

271
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,578
transplant them into that soil there the

272
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:48,708
the plant finds that aquatic layer and

273
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:51,229
I'll have a noticeable increase in the

274
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:53,568
speed of growth the plants really seem

275
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,918
to use the nitrates better you know and

276
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:57,229
much faster than the night you know

277
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:58,759
typical ammonia in the soil and that

278
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,079
really helps with the growth

279
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,089
accelerating growth as well as the

280
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,708
additional air exposure because those

281
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:05,959
roots are flood and drain they have much

282
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,248
more air exposure and between the air

283
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,289
and the in the different form of

284
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,600
nitrogen it really aches

285
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,069
the rates that growth rate so they grow

286
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,810
straight through that burlap and into

287
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,759
the water so that the plant has both a

288
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:18,518
network in the soil and in the water and

289
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,259
when I was back working at the aquaponic

290
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,909
source a long time ago where I used to

291
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:23,709
work in their lab and we did all kinds

292
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:26,019
of experiments and we found the woodier

293
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:28,899
the crop in aquaponics the more it

294
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:31,060
relies on mycorrhizal fungi and the more

295
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,528
lignin it has I guess to boil it down as

296
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,419
a general rule of thumb again not

297
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:36,669
definitive but as a general rule of

298
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:38,740
thumb in aquaponics you need a deeper

299
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,409
soil layer for the woody air of the crop

300
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,220
so if I was doing fruit trees or

301
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:44,078
something I was going to do and

302
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,079
definitely maybe I'll do more of a 2/3

303
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,250
soil to 1/3 of flood and drain where as

304
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:53,769
what cannabis plants we're going to

305
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:58,419
about a 50/50 instead do should people

306
00:11:53,769 --> 00:12:02,139
resist the temptation to have a drip

307
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:04,689
irrigation with aquaponic water from the

308
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:09,269
top because we want to encourage the

309
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:13,000
cannabis roots to explore the deeper

310
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:16,990
aquaponic layer downwards and because we

311
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,208
want to encourage them to to expand sure

312
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,190
so actually top water all the all of our

313
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,659
soil layer our flood and drain layer

314
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,630
actually leaves about a half inch of

315
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:27,759
where before the soil we don't want it

316
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:30,759
to touch or wick and then we top water

317
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,110
about twice a week and that a view

318
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,328
absolutely you could use an automated

319
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,909
system we have for our larger systems we

320
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:38,588
use a completely automated array I've

321
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:41,110
actually designed in my own manifold

322
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,089
that allows us to water as many plants

323
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,399
as we need to simultaneously within

324
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:48,490
about 10 milliliters difference across

325
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,990
all the plants a simultaneously so this

326
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,698
way we don't have to worry about over

327
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,470
watering and having that water go

328
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:54,929
through so in a dual root zone we're

329
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,278
gonna take their water and say it takes

330
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:59,289
16 ounces of water to fully saturate

331
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,110
that upper soil layer which will we'll

332
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:03,549
test before we put the pots in the bed

333
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,778
with with you know we'll just say for

334
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,629
the sake of argument we have an 8 ounce

335
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:10,328
party cup well it takes two of those for

336
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:11,708
me to water for that water to drip

337
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:13,629
through the soil and go out through the

338
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:16,000
bottom I'm going to reduce that amount

339
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,799
by half and in the future if I need to

340
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,230
top water I'm only going to do is with 8

341
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,120
ounces of water so that I'm not dosing

342
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,310
so much that it's leaching out into the

343
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,379
aquarium and this allows me to you know

344
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,028
maintain moisture levels in that upper

345
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:30,519
layer between the humidity coming off

346
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:32,169
the bottom of the the bed and then the

347
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,549
the top watering we can maintain you

348
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,559
know Pleasant moisture levels for the

349
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:37,750
root system and do some minor feeding

350
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:40,719
that the plant waste are that sorry the

351
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,940
fish waste provides around 80 to 85 to

352
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,769
90% of the nutrients the plants need and

353
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,450
then we just amend that last 10 percent

354
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,309
through the soil layer either through

355
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,830
minerals that we make in the initial

356
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:53,500
soil compost mix that we use for it or

357
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,660
through top feeding depending on what it

358
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,909
is that we needed a given time when you

359
00:13:55,659 --> 00:14:00,730
are top watering are you top watering

360
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:04,569
with water from the aquaponic system or

361
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:06,100
are you using I don't know terrestrial

362
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,220
water I guess I'll call it you know

363
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,930
regular water so we actually use water

364
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,120
from the aquaponic system with one

365
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:15,759
exception would be the second half of

366
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,210
flour but in veg or certainly the first

367
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,639
half of a flour we would absolutely use

368
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,930
system water it's just a matter of in

369
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,639
late flour you're really trying to cut

370
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:26,199
back on the nitrogen as much as possible

371
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,028
so we don't want to put any more on so

372
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,970
that probably the only time that we

373
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:33,070
don't use water from the system itself

374
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,750
otherwise we're just recirculating water

375
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,278
from the system for our top feeding we

376
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,089
just pump it into a separate

377
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:41,708
mineralization tank some water from our

378
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:44,709
mineralization tanks which we can talk

379
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:46,539
about and and then we also amend it so

380
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,909
if I have a the pH is too low we'll add

381
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:51,099
potassium silicate or calcium carbonate

382
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:52,838
or you know whatever pH up that we're

383
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,070
going to use at the time and amend it

384
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,959
that way and before we add it back in

385
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,760
but this way we can add some mineral

386
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,739
rich nutrients back into the system that

387
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,559
all you know all come from the system

388
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,600
awesome great explanation so my second

389
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,579
question on that is you know I live on

390
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,259
an island right and one of the

391
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,050
challenges that we've got is I live on

392
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,819
an agricultural island and and and

393
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:15,449
people are constantly saying don't put

394
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,250
too you know don't overnight Rijn

395
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,800
nitrogen york your fields because when

396
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,370
it runs off the island it goes into the

397
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,229
Puget Sound and it causes you know the

398
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,889
too much algae and red tide and all

399
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:32,289
those kind of stuff I wondered to what

400
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:34,679
degree do you have to for example avoid

401
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:37,679
using compost teas in the

402
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,879
plants because as these nutrients go

403
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:44,338
through the plant they end up in your

404
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,679
aquarium your aquaponic layer and might

405
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:49,440
throw off your balance there I mean are

406
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:52,799
you only supposed to use the aquaponic

407
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,930
or you know clean non treated water or

408
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,250
can can I go ahead and use compost teas

409
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:59,159
and because it doesn't really matter

410
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,470
oh no use teas and ferments as part of

411
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,230
our mineralization process we also use

412
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,019
ferments as a way to biocontrol for

413
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,028
pathogens we actually use lactobacillus

414
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,259
ferments labs I'm sure you've had many

415
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:12,088
people on the show talk about the

416
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,439
wonders of labs yeah but one of the cool

417
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,029
things of labs is in an aquatic

418
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,760
environment is Italy you call by

419
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:19,708
salmonella listeria and other things in

420
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,419
the controlled lab environment that I

421
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,799
can quote I can't say it work on a

422
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,259
person all the time on your farm legally

423
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,829
but the fact that in a laboratory it

424
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:31,139
works not and and you know it works very

425
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,580
well in practicality as well so you can

426
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,929
use these types of things not only to

427
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,639
keep system clean but to eliminate

428
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:37,649
pathogens and still use all those

429
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,458
wonderful compost to use and ferments

430
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:43,889
we're a bit real huge on horsetail

431
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,479
foreign ferments there's a great one we

432
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:48,720
also use we'll use occasionally fruit

433
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,639
juice ferments as well in flour for top

434
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,589
feeding so all the stuff that you guys

435
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,338
have you know use already for your soil

436
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,150
mixes absolutely can be used for

437
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:59,580
aquaponics and many of them actually

438
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,799
have some radically additional benefits

439
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,190
in aquaponics the one exception of a

440
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,149
yucca

441
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:08,308
extract and any kind of wetting agents

442
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,439
are you know plant-based wetting agents

443
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:12,629
steppin ins and some other things like

444
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,100
that those are all fish lethal so you

445
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,540
always have to be careful just because

446
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,119
it's organic doesn't mean it won't kill

447
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:20,818
your fish right on yeah because it is

448
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,678
while while it may not be you know an

449
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:24,000
organic toxin it's gonna throw off the

450
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,000
balance enough that it's no longer a

451
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,259
good living environment for the fish oh

452
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,990
no say phonons are straight up fish

453
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:34,200
lethal the Indians and the Indians in

454
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,549
California used to our natives I don't

455
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,549
know I guess that's the correct term now

456
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:41,129
the natives in California used to

457
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:42,480
collect yucca root extract yucca root

458
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,000
they'd squeeze the juice out of it

459
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,950
concentrate it and evaporate it off pour

460
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,990
it into streams during the salmon run

461
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,319
and

462
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,759
the salmon and then dry them and and you

463
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,259
know this happen and once it's cooked

464
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:55,849
and everything is perfectly fun for

465
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:59,089
humans but it kills the fish and like

466
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:01,579
you know parts per billion levels in a

467
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:03,589
river so man that's a mad science right

468
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:06,500
there to know that so early on without

469
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:08,689
an analytics lab yeah with no chemistry

470
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,058
knowledge or you know an idea of even

471
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,500
what chemistry was you know to come up

472
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:14,000
with that's pretty wild so it really

473
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,169
makes you it's really any interesting

474
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,690
sometimes they look at some of the

475
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,340
ancient solutions you know some of the

476
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,210
interesting stuff I've done with amino

477
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:24,980
acid isolation actually came from like

478
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,440
sixteenth and seventeenth-century die

479
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,000
making techniques that I kind of adapted

480
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,700
to make plant food and some other cool

481
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,140
stuff so there's always you know really

482
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,490
neat things sometimes going back in

483
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,730
history and looking at how we used to do

484
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:41,419
things you know is all sometimes even

485
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,829
better than looking forward so um so

486
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,850
what I'm hearing from you I really

487
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:47,148
thought that it was kind of like a

488
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:50,148
zero-sum game you either did you know

489
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:52,788
living soil growing or you did

490
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:57,469
aquaponics growing and it really sounds

491
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:59,419
like aquaponics is supercharged living

492
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,360
soil growing because you're doing all

493
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:05,390
your your regular living soil stuff that

494
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:07,879
you would do to create this healthy you

495
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:11,140
know raizo sphere in the upper layers

496
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,789
but then you're super charging it with

497
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,669
the water food web that we're going to

498
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:18,890
talk more about in the second set as the

499
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:24,020
roots reaches down to the aquaponic

500
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:26,538
layer absolutely yeah and again it gives

501
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:28,609
you benefits of both worlds and you

502
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:31,190
absolutely could do it just a soil and

503
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:33,019
do in a wicking bed but with this we get

504
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,259
you know radically increase in speed of

505
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:39,019
growth we get radical increase in speed

506
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:44,778
of a bunch of different mineralization

507
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:46,398
methods and we get a radical increase in

508
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:49,880
disease resistance a radical increase

509
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:51,558
and interpret expression as well and you

510
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,110
know all those combined really makes a

511
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,089
big difference right on so let's go

512
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,339
ahead and dive into that during set two

513
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,928
and wrap up this one now so we're gonna

514
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:01,369

Rae's 'nor so Steve during the first set

653
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,720
we we pretty much got a little bit a

654
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,519
grip of what we were even talking about

655
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,798
right because there's a lot of

656
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,139
misperceptions coming into aquaponics

657
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,579
about what's even going on and so so now

658
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,500
that we understand that we've got this

advantage of advantage of both the the

661
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:23,380
magic of having a living microbe life

662
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:28,590
rhizosphere of a living soil but then

663
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:32,500
also this added benefit of the the water

664
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:34,839
food web that the the roots are

665
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,019
extending down into that's what I where

666
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:40,029
I want to emphasis now because when I

667
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:44,200
first heard you speak about the water

668
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:46,240
food web at Joshua Rutherford and

669
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,730
Leighton Morrison's traveling

670
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,490
regenerative cannabis series like my

671
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,620
mind was blown man like I did not it

672
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,870
never even occurred to me that all the

673
00:25:53,619 --> 00:26:00,250
cool stuff that we were talking about in

674
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:03,879
the soil biome could also be happening

675
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,798
in water and and I just I just listened

676
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,309
to you with my mouth at gate B I like

677
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:11,619
surprised so so before I go into like my

678
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:15,069
series of questions why don't you just

679
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:19,889
kind of like dive into your explanation

680
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:23,048
of the soil food web and why the

681
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,669
inhabitants of a healthy I dare scald

682
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:28,000
living water I don't know if that's the

683
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:31,659
term but like who lives in the living

684
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,140
water that's adding so much more value

685
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:36,970
versus just using living soil so I guess

686
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,250
the the quick and easy answer is we

687
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,529
don't know what one's doing any research

688
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,039
on on which microbes are doing what and

689
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,389
the

690
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,460
environment because everyone's so

691
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:47,350
focused on soil because of mass

692
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,420
agriculture there's there's next to no

693
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:52,539
research being done on freshwater

694
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:54,430
aquatic microbes in relation to you know

695
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:57,250
mineralization so that's that's the

696
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,110
quick answer but so so how I like to

697
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,240
explain it is so with our method we have

698
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:03,669
that we call it the dual root zone so in

699
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,880
your your upper half we have soil so we

700
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:10,450
have micro rise a fungi we have you know

701
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,920
micro arthropods you know all your

702
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,299
different worms all your different you

703
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,009
know mites all the different creatures

704
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,799
that you know we're all familiar with in

705
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,569
the the soil and they have their own key

706
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,240
components and I'm sure there's many

707
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:23,889
different wise people that have shared a

708
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,230
lot of that critical information on your

709
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,710
show in the aquatic environment we have

710
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,380
we do have mycorrhizae and there are

711
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,480
fungi and fungal networks that will grow

712
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,130
aquatic Lea but they're not that they're

713
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,200
very miniscule in terms of total

714
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,910
population they're generally five

715
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,980
percent or less of the total biomass in

716
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:44,529
the aquatic environment whereas we rely

717
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:51,190
much more heavily on bacteria and

718
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:53,339
rotifer and protists and what's the name

719
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,080
of the other one begins with an a

720
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:58,209
they're like bacteria anyways

721
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:03,779
I'll think of it but so you have all

722
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:06,190
these different aquatic microbes that Oh

723
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,599
ma'am for whatever reason that it's

724
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,730
bugging me okay I remember the name of

725
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,589
it I'll think of it you know pop it'll

726
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,089
pop up at some point inappropriately

727
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:17,049
down the line and then just say it out

728
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:18,669
loud archaea thank you archaea archaea

729
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:20,379
so you have all these different aquatic

730
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:23,920
microbes and we have a much more bio

731
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,450
diverse matrix so imagine if like all of

732
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,830
your air could it was a really good

733
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,569
environment for microbes and there are

734
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:31,329
microbes that live in the air but it's

735
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:33,099
not quite the same as the water in the

736
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:35,079
water we can have much much much higher

737
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:38,109
microbial densities than you can in soil

738
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:39,879
and on average in aquaponic do root zone

739
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:41,889
set up has a hundred and sixty seven

740
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,140
percent more microbial biodiversity in

741
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:47,310
the root system compared to the even the

742
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:49,990
most diverse living soils and and

743
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:52,329
hydroponic systems it's not even

744
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,650
comparable so but even your most of our

745
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:55,899
soil we're at one hundred sixty seven

746
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,090
percent more microbes in the root system

747
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,320
about 70% of the microbes an aquatic

748
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:01,689
environment can also survive in

749
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,039
terrestrial environments which is why we

750
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,840
need to do a lot of research on these

751
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,700
because a lot of these you know we know

752
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:09,189
that for example CBD almost across the

753
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,279
board will express higher in aquaponics

754
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:15,340
all things be considered equal that in

755
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:17,079
terrestrial expression we also know

756
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,599
given certain stimuli that we can

757
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:22,689
increase THC V expression significantly

758
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,990
past most soil controls as well all but

759
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:27,009
two controls we've done so far so and

760
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,779
that's mostly just having to do with

761
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,829
cult of our difference but there's all

762
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:31,420
these different genes that are being

763
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:33,519
activated and do we know nothing about

764
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,100
because we've never activated them in

765
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,019
soil because there's aquatic microbes or

766
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:39,429
other stimuli through the aquatic

767
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:41,559
environment that's stimulating them and

768
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,670
triggering them and we don't know it you

769
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:44,019
know there could be terpenes or

770
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,759
cannabinoids that are only found in

771
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:47,319
aquaponics or there you know it could be

772
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,879
a way to you know especially with some

773
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:50,409
of the minor cannabinoids it seems like

774
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,230
you know we can pretty radically

775
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,269
increase production of you know certain

776
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,120
cannabinoids compared to our soil

777
00:29:55,269 --> 00:30:00,339
controls so this is a wildly under

778
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:02,529
researched area with a lot of room for

779
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:04,359
growth for folks who are getting into

780
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:06,160
the scene and and want to start doing a

781
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:09,189
research in something that's fresh and

782
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,810
new to them oh absolutely and and I want

783
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,789
what I guess one takeaway I want people

784
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,740
to take from this is that you know think

785
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:16,509
about you know you don't even have to do

786
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,609
do root so in aquaponics with your soil

787
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:20,589
just think about how can I increase the

788
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:24,849
microbial biodiversity in ways they're

789
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:26,619
non-pathogenic and non you know negative

790
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:27,669
to the the rest of the microbiome you

791
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:29,199
know don't go dumping a ton of

792
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,720
Trichoderma on your system it's not

793
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,640
going to work but you know if you had

794
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,329
horrible Pythium that might make sense

795
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,490
you know it just depends so it up so so

796
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:40,869
you and I were talking like before we

797
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,329
got on air you and I were talking about

798
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,519
we both have backgrounds in aquariums so

799
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:47,589
I can I can really hear the person out

800
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,859
there going I've got an aquarium like

801
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:52,269
like when we do water changes regularly

802
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:53,829
right where you've got to remove some of

803
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,660
the water and you replace it with fresh

804
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:58,659
for the good of the for the good of the

805
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,960
inhabitants of the aquarium you know

806
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:04,029
could somebody rep you and their home

807
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,860
grow just by simply taking a gallon or

808
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,619
whatever or a couple cups out of their

809
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:11,529
aquarium and pouring it into their pace

810
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:14,169
grow or whatever or or is that there's

811
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:16,149
that overly simplified oh no you

812
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,610
absolutely get benefit from that I would

813
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,620
not do that in Flour you know especially

814
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:22,058
late in the flower I wouldn't do that

815
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:24,519
because you don't want the nitrates from

816
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:25,990
that but you could absolutely when

817
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,029
you're doing your water change to take

818
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,250
that dirty water especially for veg or

819
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:32,200
for you know a first week or two a

820
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:36,160
flower absolutely that would be great or

821
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,289
even take your when you do a water

822
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,970
change take the water let it settle pour

823
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:41,980
off the clear water and use that just

824
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,990
for regular watering for your veg and

825
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,429
stuff and then take that thick heavier

826
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,650
stuff and throw an air stone in it and a

827
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:49,150
little bit of a little bit more you know

828
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,070
maybe the only drain about half way

829
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,470
throw an air stone and mix it up like a

830
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:54,819
really concentrated compost tea maybe

831
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,210
throw a little bit of your favorite

832
00:31:54,819 --> 00:32:00,308
microbial mix um you know recharge or

833
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,630
mammoth pee or whoever it is that you

834
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:02,410
you like or even some of your own

835
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,320
compost

836
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,420
inputs or whoever whoever it is uh you

837
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,819
know your your special blend or your

838
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,558
secret mix throw the microbes in there

839
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:13,058
let it mineralize and then put that back

840
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,399
on the plants and let that unlock you

841
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,750
know 80 70 80 percent more of the

842
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,280
nutrients that are in that fish waste

843
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,529
that are just locked up in a non plant

844
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:22,509
available form this can be a great way

845
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:25,029
for organic people that have you know

846
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:26,829
large aquariums or even large ponds that

847
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:29,170
have you know lots of muck and stuff in

848
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:30,490
the filters use it it's great plant food

849
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,710
you're seeing mineralize it the way you

850
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,970
would with compost tea oh man I can't

851
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:38,980
imagine how that I threw away just down

852
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:42,730
the down the drain all that fantastic

853
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:44,829
Malm that used to gather at the bottom

854
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,319
of the aquariums you know that all the

855
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:49,058
all the fish waste and old plant matter

856
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:52,779
and all that stuff on the bottom which

857
00:32:49,058 --> 00:32:54,190
in those days was was filth right that

858
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:55,960
none of those bad stuff and we would

859
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,580
pull that out with the vacuum and now

860
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,529
I'm like oh man if I could just you know

861
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:05,619
have all that stuff for my plants that's

862
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:08,529
got to be you know pure gold so in the

863
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:11,409
is so in the water web you know since

864
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:15,250
there's not mycelium networks like there

865
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:17,860
are in soil what plays the role of

866
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,650
moving nutrients around that the

867
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:21,500
mycelium does in the soil is it simple

868
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,710
wat simply

869
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:28,000
water flow it's not only water flow but

870
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:30,700
you have just a much higher density of

871
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,380
microorganisms you have seed shrimp and

872
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,059
lots more nematodes and all different

873
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,190
types of amoebas and protists and

874
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:38,929
rotifers and and all kinds of things

875
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,220
that are just swimming around moving you

876
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,900
know and transporting nutrients around

877
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,519
at a much higher rate you also have the

878
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,190
fact that a lot you know there's a lot

879
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:49,190
more nutrient capacity and in water

880
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,690
period to hold a lot of these nutrients

881
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,039
and and to dissolve a lot of these

882
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,070
nutrients in a way that is quickly

883
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:57,259
usable both by the microbes but also by

884
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:59,869
the plants themselves so that you know

885
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:01,910
it doesn't even have to be in that you

886
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:04,579
know solid form either you know a lot of

887
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,769
its just in the aquatic environment so

888
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:08,059
you've used the term flood and drain a

889
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:09,378
couple times would you go ahead and

890
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:12,860
break that out for folks who are new to

891
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:16,668
it sure so we have tables generally

892
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:19,070
twelve by 4-foot tables in in long rows

893
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:21,378
and the and the water comes up and it

894
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,780
floods about the bottom five to six

895
00:34:21,378 --> 00:34:27,159
depending on the type of setup inches of

896
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:29,480
water and then it has a bell siphon

897
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,800
which was actually first invented by

898
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,260
Pythagoras you can look it up the

899
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,450
Pythagorean cup or the Greek Cup which

900
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,450
was designed to spill out all the wine

901
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:40,908
if you overfilled the wine cup of wine

902
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:43,250
but what it does is as the water comes

903
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:45,378
up to the top it creates a vacuum at the

904
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,269
very top of the Bell and that sucks in

905
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:49,159
the air and allows the water to drain

906
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:50,239
and then once the water comes all the

907
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,860
way down to the bottom of the Bell

908
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,898
there's a couple of slits cut that break

909
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,059
that and then what this allows us to do

910
00:34:53,898 --> 00:34:58,130
and then the water stops and then allows

911
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:59,539
the the it drains the bed completely it

912
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,760
allows the bed to fill back up again

913
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:04,309
what this allows us to do is run one

914
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,710
pump and continuously fill 3,000 square

915
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:08,179
feet of grow beds or even six thousand

916
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,570
square feet of grow beds off of a single

917
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:13,099
pump you know with one failure point you

918
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,200
know I can put a redundancy pump in

919
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:16,969
there if that one goes down it turns on

920
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,289
the other one and it just makes it

921
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:20,779
really simple to make sure nothing bad

922
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:23,179
happens even in the event of some kind

923
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,420
of catastrophic failure so what's

924
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:26,899
happening is that one or a couple times

925
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,869
a day

926
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,900
this floods and and as the water level

927
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:35,579
rises you're introducing all of these

928
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:39,240
all this water food

929
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:44,579
web nutrition and microbes and various

930
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:47,369
guys into the the rhizosphere from the

931
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:49,679
roots that are hanging down below the

932
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:53,549
pot and then also some of that it's

933
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:57,269
getting sucked up into the soil as well

934
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:59,280
and so you're doing this feeding in this

935
00:35:57,269 --> 00:36:03,150
way how many times a day are you gonna

936
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,370
do this this this flood and drain so the

937
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,680
flood and drain is on a cycle and if

938
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:09,269
floods depending on the size of

939
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,989
dimensions of the bed anywhere between

940
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:14,250
seven and 18 minutes and just drains and

941
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:18,029
floods again and fills again

942
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,769
continuously so this is why having those

943
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,570
roots then this is why they're not

944
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:23,340
getting choked off of oxygen because

945
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,900
it's they're never living a hundred

946
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,329
percent of the time in water it's just

947
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,710
the water comes up and touches them and

948
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:31,380
gives them a feed and then it recedes

949
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:33,710
and then it comes up again so it creates

950
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,910
this really nice analogue rhythm

951
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,619
absolutely and most plants that give it

952
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:39,869
as long as the dissolved oxygen level is

953
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,880
high enough most plants are around the

954
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:43,799
three to four parts per million

955
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,660
dissolved oxygen level as long as you're

956
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,280
above that they'll build you okay

957
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:48,929
obviously it'll do better if it's higher

958
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,460
than that but that's kind of the minimum

959
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:52,759
I know lettuce you can get it as low as

960
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,460
2.2 parts per million which is super low

961
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,470
but most other plants really do want you

962
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,849
know to be significantly higher you know

963
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:03,750
most the time you're wanting for a 5 or

964
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:06,960
above you know bar minimum so so in in

965
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:09,210
the soil food web we use soil amendments

966
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,010
to increase the soil viability and you

967
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,230
know in a perfect system that we're

968
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,440
talking about a you know something that

969
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,269
is no-till with with with some aged soil

970
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,760
that has mycelium networks already set

971
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:23,009
up but but you know if if somebody

972
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,540
doesn't have a no-till setup they've

973
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,370
they've put together a soil and they've

974
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:28,980
added some soil amendments to increase

975
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:31,380
soil value ability are they're healthy

976
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,949
additives when you're working with the

977
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,440
water food web as well and and and and

978
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:40,379
those inputs can we wildcraft them like

979
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,920
what are you doing to to develop the

980
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:48,329
healthy the healthy and vibrancy of this

981
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,380
water sure so we use things like dtpa

982
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,269
iron

983
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,298
for iron and that's iron and potassium

984
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:56,009
and calcium kind of our big problems

985
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:57,949
because they either get exported by

986
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,450
large amounts by the plant material or

987
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:03,078
they are oxidized in the case of iron

988
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:05,159
you know fe2 gets converted into fe 3

989
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:08,099
unless it has some kind of chelation

990
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:11,129
around it so those are kind of I guess

991
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:12,420
our big problems and so we've managed

992
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,000
usually handle the calcium and potassium

993
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,369
through pH up our pH will gradually go

994
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,369
down over time so we'll use potassium

995
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:22,200
silicate and calcium carbonate to amend

996
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:24,720
that to fix that and add you know

997
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,338
potassium silica and calcium as well as

998
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,139
some loose carbonate so there's a lot of

999
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:29,548
really bad information around aquaponics

1000
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,440
that you know you shouldn't have any

1001
00:38:29,548 --> 00:38:33,389
carbonates you actually need to maintain

1002
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,710
at least 40 parts per million carbon

1003
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:39,480
it's ideally higher or you will actually

1004
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,088
cut your microbial replication and a

1005
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,710
half and as we all know for soil or

1006
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:45,480
aquatics you know you don't want to ever

1007
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,429
cut your microbial replication in half

1008
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,869
so you know and that's one of the

1009
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:50,279
biggest problems you I know we before

1010
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:51,510
the show we talked about it you know

1011
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,010
there's not a there's a lot of

1012
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,140
information on aquaponics but a lot of

1013
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,270
it's just really bad and there's a lot

1014
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:59,190
of stuff that's just any anyone with a

1015
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:00,809
scientific mind that reads it's just can

1016
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,639
can see that there's problems and that's

1017
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:05,099
been one of the big reasons that it's

1018
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,808
held held up the aquaponics movement is

1019
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,130
just the fact that there's only a

1020
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:09,510
handful of people that really know what

1021
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,460
they're doing to begin with

1022
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,109
well that brings us back to the drum

1023
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,480
that you beat every time I hear you talk

1024
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:17,219
which is there's just not enough proper

1025
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,798
education and cannabis yet you know

1026
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:22,469
everybody needs to get more educated the

1027
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:25,409
growers the breeders the end consumers

1028
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:27,568
and you know more and more people are

1029
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:28,828
getting indicate education but that

1030
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:30,358
doesn't mean that the quality of the

1031
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:32,250
education is high there's a lot of

1032
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:34,199
people just repeating myths and our

1033
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,380
whole scene could do a lot better when

1034
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:40,199
it comes to education so absolutely I

1035
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,450
know I effect I've actually spoken at

1036
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:44,818
three churches in Oklahoma where we had

1037
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:46,348
a pastor come in and one someone that

1038
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:48,298
can talk about it and it's really funny

1039
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:49,980
to go into a place there you know who

1040
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:52,289
would have thought that I'd be walking

1041
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,440
into a church in southern you know at

1042
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:58,889
Oklahoma to go talk about cannabis like

1043
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,170
what happened Wow like what what she

1044
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:02,579
like what you know I just feels like one

1045
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,710
day all of a sudden everything

1046
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:06,989
okay and you know that just to go from

1047
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:09,240
where we were you know when we were in

1048
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:10,589
high school to where we are now or you

1049
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:13,109
know I'm able to go in and speak into a

1050
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:14,579
church in Oklahoma it's just some days

1051
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,990
you just got to sit back even though we

1052
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,059
have a lot of struggles right now I know

1053
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:19,679
especially with with some of the legal

1054
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:21,210
stuff and people trying to patent things

1055
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,009
and all this other mess that people get

1056
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,780
headaches but you know sometimes it's

1057
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,600
nice just to sit back and go like wow

1058
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,130
like this is just crazy how much how

1059
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,809
much you know different it is now that

1060
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,789
we even have churches that are taking

1061
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:34,409
talking about it and there's there's a

1062
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:36,389
certain amount of humor to in the fact

1063
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:38,250
that even though like you know the

1064
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:40,889
historical Jesus would not have been

1065
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:43,139
white you know your long-hair hippie

1066
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:44,699
looking guy like you on the stage you

1067
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:48,420
probably did not look all that different

1068
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:49,980
from then the guy on the crucifix so

1069
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,010
moving right along from that before I

1070
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,230
dig myself a hole so you know one of the

1071
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:57,030
things about aquaponics that it's like

1072
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:59,130
one of the main things everybody knows

1073
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:02,190
is that there's fish involved right and

1074
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:05,849
and so let's talk about the fish

1075
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:08,730
themselves we're in this system do the

1076
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:13,529
fish live and how do you choose what

1077
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:15,179
fish to have sure so we generally choose

1078
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,640
the fish based on the temperature of the

1079
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:20,519
system and then the market marketability

1080
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,349
of the fish and then whether or not that

1081
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:26,280
particular region will allow us to get a

1082
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:28,019
sorry meat processing license so in most

1083
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,750
states the United States in fact all of

1084
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:32,309
them you cannot have a cannabis facility

1085
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,320
and a meat processing license because

1086
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:37,349
the meat processing inspection guys are

1087
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,870
all federal and federally answer to a

1088
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:41,400
federal board or whatever so they can't

1089
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:43,829
deal with anyone who deals with cannabis

1090
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,720
until the federal law is changed so you

1091
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:48,420
have to either have your fish processed

1092
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:50,339
by a third-party company that has meat

1093
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,930
processing or you have to sell it

1094
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,910
through the pet trade which can be a

1095
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:56,339
more lucrative option so depending on

1096
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:57,960
again your particular climate and things

1097
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,390
like that it oftentimes it's it's

1098
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,269
cheaper to and and more economical to do

1099
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:07,199
koi or some of the more larger exotic

1100
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:10,170
aquarium fish era Juana's or PACU or

1101
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,730
some of the more exotic plecos you know

1102
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,849
makes a lot more sense financially to

1103
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:16,019
raise those and flip them you know every

1104
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:17,880
12 to 24 months

1105
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:21,630
than it does you know to sell meat fish

1106
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,849
and so if you do choose the meat fish I

1107
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,800
mean the only one that I'm thinking of

1108
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,599
that that people use our tilapia but are

1109
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,380
there other meat fish that people are

1110
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,079
using in aquaponics absolutely so for

1111
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:40,349
for cannabis in particular you know

1112
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:42,329
channel catfish PACU yellow perch we've

1113
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:46,139
done trying to think that I know there's

1114
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:47,009
a few others a bluegill and then you

1115
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:48,509
know you could do anything that's

1116
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:51,060
regionally appropriate there was another

1117
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,910
group we did snake heads over for a

1118
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:55,650
vegetable grow over in India you know

1119
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:58,409
and you can also do cold water although

1120
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:59,940
you shouldn't do Salman 'add or anything

1121
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,949
like that with cannabis in particular

1122
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,769
because the potassium levels we have are

1123
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:07,139
fine for most fish but most fish that go

1124
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:09,269
from saltwater to freshwater when they

1125
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:11,879
regulate that salt the potassium seems

1126
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:14,309
to become a much bigger problem with

1127
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,990
tilapia being the one exception so that

1128
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:18,299
it tends to kill them pretty quickly

1129
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:20,939
that when they get into the you know the

1130
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,440
ranges were in for cannabis so them and

1131
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,450
white bass would be the one that we had

1132
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,920
some trouble with when we were doing our

1133
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:31,079
testing so I would avoid those so so you

1134
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,630
know in a when I'm when I see the

1135
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:36,059
illustrations online explaining a system

1136
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:38,670
very often they will simplify it and

1137
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:42,000
they'll just have what looks like a fish

1138
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:44,820
tank below the table but I imagine that

1139
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,909
that's not actually how it is because

1140
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:50,250
these tables are large and there's many

1141
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:53,039
of them is how it works in the real

1142
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:55,170
world that that somewhere near the table

1143
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,900
set up in the warehouse or wherever it's

1144
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:01,230
gonna be there will be a you know

1145
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:04,559
several hundred gallon tank and it is

1146
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:07,320
filled with the fish and then you're

1147
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,380
simply piping the water over to the

1148
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,059
table yep yep so a lot of people think

1149
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,619
that the fish are actually living in the

1150
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:15,840
plant roots which is not the case they

1151
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,819
will happily eat the plant roots in most

1152
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,289
cases it's a it's a cool thing to

1153
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,730
picture in your head though right the

1154
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,440
idea of the oh you're swimming between

1155
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:24,090
the roots that sounds cool but yeah

1156
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,860
you're right having them munch on their

1157
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,480
roots that's not a win you know what

1158
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,370
does work really well though we talked a

1159
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,869
little bit about this in the past is the

1160
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:32,579
little colorful shrimp that you like

1161
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,210
alone yeah the Neo karabiner I heard a

1162
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,819
hetero pota

1163
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:37,559
yeah they were great in the to keep the

1164
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,300
root systems look full exfoliated and

1165
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,230
keep the detritus and the algae out of

1166
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:44,760
there they're they're awesome but so but

1167
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,679
yes so we actually have some tanks

1168
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,470
everything flows back to the sub tanks

1169
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:52,230
the beds pump up from the sub tanks and

1170
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:54,119
go into the beds the water goes into the

1171
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,409
beds and then back down where the from

1172
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,699
where the plants are and then we have a

1173
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:59,190
separate loop where we have the

1174
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:01,559
aquariums so water pumps up from the

1175
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,240
same some over to the aquariums that

1176
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:05,579
goes from the aquariums gravity feeds in

1177
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,169
through two sets of filters and then

1178
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,730
goes back down into the ground and then

1179
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,369
we can reroute that depending on where

1180
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,019
we want it to go generally we'll keep a

1181
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:14,429
mixture of a couple you know a bunch of

1182
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:16,050
different tanks so that when we're

1183
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:17,489
rotating fish out if I have a bunch of

1184
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,230
fry obviously they're not going to

1185
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:21,689
produce a whole lot of fish waste so we

1186
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,670
can balance that out with you know

1187
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,050
another better or another fish tank or

1188
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,240
two so that we can maintain you know

1189
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,490
pretty even nutrient levels regardless

1190
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:30,989
of our harvest cycle with the fish you

1191
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:33,569
know so making sure you have you know

1192
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:35,429
extra fish tanks and it can work a

1193
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,260
rotation like that is one thing they

1194
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:39,589
often see people don't don't do well on

1195
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,730
the larger commercial operations but I

1196
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,980
know and there's other stuff too

1197
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,210
people put UV sterilizers on them which

1198
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,789
you shouldn't do you know it causes

1199
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,740
mineral issues and boron and some other

1200
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,969
stuff I mean there's a lot of just goo

1201
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:53,909
for people that tell you you don't need

1202
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:57,419
filters or you know all kinds of goofy

1203
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:59,940
stuff out there so one thing I remember

1204
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,740
from when I was raising these shrimp you

1205
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,750
know I had like 35 aquariums and I would

1206
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:06,719
often share water between the aquarium

1207
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:09,239
and then if one aquarium went south on

1208
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:12,239
it and got out of out of balance I did

1209
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:14,399
not want to share that water in my other

1210
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,049
tanks because I didn't want the disease

1211
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,119
or imbalance whatever the problem was to

1212
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,880
spread to my other tanks well in this

1213
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:26,000
case we're directly feeding from the

1214
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:30,510
aquarium into the flood and drain tables

1215
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,940
how much hassle or or potential for

1216
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:35,880
disease transfer is there from an

1217
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:39,869
imbalance or disease in the aquarium to

1218
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:42,599
then be transferred to our plants so

1219
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:44,819
today there is known

1220
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,799
own plant pathogens that have can go

1221
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,860
from a fish into a cannabis plant Wow

1222
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,080
there you could absolutely have things

1223
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,460
like in theory you could have e coli or

1224
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,599
Salmonella or some other things like

1225
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,090
that but actually the University of

1226
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,440
Hawaii did seven years of study well

1227
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:02,190
they were intentionally infecting

1228
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,139
infecting systems and had no you know

1229
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,940
tissue samples test positive in in

1230
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:08,639
aquaponics and that includes you know

1231
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,079
intentionally introducing pathogens at

1232
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,219
University Arizona University of

1233
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,929
Wisconsin have also done pretty

1234
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:15,000
extensive food safety Studies on that as

1235
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:16,710
well and then university of kentucky

1236
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,369
states actually done stuff on probiotic

1237
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,929
mitigation with that using lactobacillus

1238
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:23,609
fermentation microbes and then

1239
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:25,039
introducing those and and using those

1240
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,690
actually to eliminate even

1241
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:30,090
non-pathogenic e.coli lots of aquaponic

1242
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,889
systems will test hot for e.coli it's

1243
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,269
not an e.coli that's human pathogenic

1244
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:35,460
you could drink the water you won't get

1245
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:38,429
sick it just it's a species of e.coli

1246
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:40,590
and it will give you a false positive so

1247
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:42,210
you can absolutely use that even to

1248
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,760
eliminate those false positives as well

1249
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:46,650
and it's just it's a really good way to

1250
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,110
do something in a way that's not going

1251
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,889
to imbalance your whole system as well

1252
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:52,440
so there's lots of different solutions

1253
00:47:49,889 --> 00:47:54,449
depending on what you're doing but we

1254
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,220
actually on all the systems I design we

1255
00:47:54,449 --> 00:47:57,809
can reroute any of the beds to any of

1256
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:59,819
the stumps and the fish tanks any of the

1257
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:01,619
Sims so even if we have you know six

1258
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,750
fish I can bring that fish tank offline

1259
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:05,369
and everything else will still operate

1260
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,809
just fine you know maybe you have to do

1261
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:08,210
a little bit more balancing with some of

1262
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:10,440
the flow rates but it's not a big deal

1263
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:12,780
and this allows you to have that kind of

1264
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,059
control if I have you know somebody

1265
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,769
dropped something and breaks a valve or

1266
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,809
goes to turn a valve and it snaps or

1267
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:20,820
these things happen so you have to have

1268
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:23,159
that kind of ability to compartmentalize

1269
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,809
and shut down things or maybe you have

1270
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:27,000
an earthquake and it breaks you know how

1271
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:28,590
part of the you know treat falls down

1272
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,539
and breaks part of the system but the

1273
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:33,059
rest of it's okay you need that be able

1274
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:34,710
to isolate the system and keep as much

1275
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:37,349
production online as all times as

1276
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:39,539
possible so we plant all that into the

1277
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:40,889
the design and you know that would be

1278
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:43,259
the one time we'd break out a UV

1279
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:44,609
sterilizer or an ozonator or something

1280
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,410
like that it would be just to put on an

1281
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:47,789
offline tank just to treat the fish that

1282
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:49,079
are in there because you know we

1283
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:50,550
generally don't want to use anything

1284
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,509
that we have to you know we'll treat

1285
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,370
them with lactobacillus

1286
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,370
we'll give them there's a

1287
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:59,910
all medication you can use as a last

1288
00:48:57,429 --> 00:49:02,768
resort called prohibit there's actually

1289
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:04,868
four aquaculture that can be used for a

1290
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:08,199
fish for human consumption later on I

1291
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:11,039
believe it's a 90-day cooldown time or

1292
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:13,798
100 or 180 days if you're in Canada so

1293
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:17,528
so you know hearing you describe that

1294
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:21,400
I'm imagining a whole lot of plumbing

1295
00:49:17,528 --> 00:49:23,349
and you know with with regular soil

1296
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,420
cannabis I mean pretty much you you can

1297
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:27,430
take a flower pot throw soil and put

1298
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,519
your seat in it water that baby and

1299
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:32,558
you'll have a plant of some degree of

1300
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:34,889
success right and then and then from

1301
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,440
that point on as you learn more you can

1302
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:40,179
make your plants better and better

1303
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,179
aquaponics though like you need to have

1304
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:45,909
a certain depth in what you're doing

1305
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:48,248
just a plan and strategize and build one

1306
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:49,899
of these in advance I would think that

1307
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:53,528
you know especially in the idea of

1308
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:56,740
measure twice cut once like the the

1309
00:49:53,528 --> 00:49:59,559
install is probably by far the biggest

1310
00:49:56,739 --> 00:50:03,669
hassle of the whole aquaponics process

1311
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:05,528
oh yeah yeah absolutely the I do a lot

1312
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,298
of design work for different companies

1313
00:50:05,528 --> 00:50:09,518
and in design farms that's mainly what I

1314
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:10,900
do these days is design them or or help

1315
00:50:09,518 --> 00:50:15,608
people that have already built them that

1316
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:17,200
they need help with their SOPs but but

1317
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:19,268
absolutely yeah it's a lot of plumbing

1318
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,068
and if you don't know what you're doing

1319
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:23,108
or design it wrong I know there's a

1320
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:24,849
company out there right now it's one of

1321
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:26,880
the bigger aquaponics companies that has

1322
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:29,950
a cannabis specific system that has

1323
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,548
given me a lot of business which I'm

1324
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:35,710
thankful for right on they they get the

1325
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:38,170
out of the box so they get the boxed

1326
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:41,289
solution and they're like oh we need we

1327
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:42,818
need better than the box yep yeah so

1328
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:46,089
since we're talking about a

1329
00:50:42,818 --> 00:50:48,489
lactobacillus acid serum I

1330
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:51,489
I told you and since it's trending so

1331
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:54,278
much I got to ask is there are there KNF

1332
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:57,220
korean natural farming applications for

1333
00:50:54,278 --> 00:51:02,559
aquaponics absolutely yeah we actually

1334
00:50:57,219 --> 00:51:06,129
use I am a one liquid IMO we don't use

1335
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:09,160
FFA we don't use IMO three just too much

1336
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,930
sugar you know and

1337
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,190
stuff like that you know it wouldn't

1338
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:13,480
make sense but you know anything that

1339
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,070
would make sense within an aquatic

1340
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,909
environment is if it works perfectly

1341
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:20,470
well you know we'll use o hn and all

1342
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,149
those things are perfectly fine to use

1343
00:51:20,469 --> 00:51:23,439
in your aquaponic system in fact you

1344
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,360
know what's interesting with o hn and

1345
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,240
people talk about alcohol dosing so you

1346
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,730
have a cito bacter bacteria that live in

1347
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:33,759
your soil and acetobacter love to feed

1348
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:35,889
on nitrogen so you can actually use I

1349
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,030
like it on a reef tank and I don't I

1350
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:39,250
don't know how much you remember this

1351
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:40,540
from aquariums but and in aquariums you

1352
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,760
can actually do something called vodka

1353
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:44,500
dosing where you can dose with vodka to

1354
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,720
feed the acetobacter x' to break down

1355
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,670
the nitrogen and make it non lethal to

1356
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,549
the the fish and bind it up so you could

1357
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:54,610
actually do very similar dosing with

1358
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:56,710
soil or aquatics for plants as well in

1359
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:58,809
terrestrial it's not quite as extreme as

1360
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:00,699
it doesn't an aquarium but it'll still

1361
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:01,960
give you a reduction to nitrogen de so

1362
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:05,230
that you're not ending up with too much

1363
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,699
end coming into flower so when I was at

1364
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,740
the regenerative cannabis conference

1365
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:11,739
that you were speaking with that back in

1366
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:14,079
Michigan this summer Alain Hingham said

1367
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:17,799
you know she pointed out the importance

1368
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,679
of of having real sunshine hitting the

1369
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:24,220
soil of our plants because you know this

1370
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,929
the sunshine hitting the plant of course

1371
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:27,939
is going to give us the widest terpene

1372
00:52:25,929 --> 00:52:31,569
profiles and let the plant express

1373
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:36,130
itself most naturally but then also how

1374
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:39,190
the this the sunshine hitting the soil

1375
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:40,630
around the base of the plant was having

1376
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:43,090
all this interaction with the soil

1377
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:45,910
microbes directly and the warming of the

1378
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:47,829
soil and like you know all this analog

1379
00:52:45,909 --> 00:52:51,460
magic that was was happening when the

1380
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:55,659
sunshine hits the soil now people will

1381
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:58,750
will fake the Sun with lights indoor but

1382
00:52:55,659 --> 00:53:01,629
those lights don't fake out the soil and

1383
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:04,170
so there's a certain amount of microbe

1384
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:07,570
activity loss because it's not you know

1385
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:11,139
authentic sunshine how does that cross

1386
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:14,650
apply over to aquaponics is it is it

1387
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:17,049
very easy to do an aquaponics setup

1388
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:19,960
under artificial lights or are you

1389
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:22,860
needing to do this under glass roofs or

1390
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,990
in greenhouses or something like that

1391
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:28,070
we've had equal success both the naka

1392
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:30,059
and Indore and with greenhouses I

1393
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,620
personally I think anyone who's not

1394
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:33,210
doing greenhouses at this point is

1395
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:35,219
wasting money on cultivation because

1396
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,240
you're not going to be around you know

1397
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:38,699
that when the price comes down

1398
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,199
ultimately there's just your you

1399
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:41,609
shouldn't be investing in Indore at this

1400
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:45,149
point unless you're doing breeding or

1401
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:46,470
really specific cultivars or something

1402
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,970
like that where it really makes sense

1403
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:50,459
otherwise for commercial production

1404
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:53,099
you're just gonna get priced out the

1405
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,780
market pretty quick yeah so last

1406
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:57,449
question before we go to commercial like

1407
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,430
you know I'm a big fan of poly culture

1408
00:53:57,449 --> 00:54:01,649
and companion planting and we talked

1409
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:03,239
about a lot on this show are there

1410
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,059
opportunities for doing companion

1411
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:08,069
planning in aquaponics oh absolutely I'm

1412
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:12,889
a big fan of companion planting as well

1413
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:17,789
we're big on purslane watercress time

1414
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:20,609
majorem creeping lavender creeping

1415
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:22,679
rosemary we've got all different types

1416
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,800
of stuff in our aquaponic systems we

1417
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,569
find that you know really helps with you

1418
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,910
know just a healthier root systems in

1419
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:33,420
general do you find that it's helping

1420
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:35,399
both the you know we know about poly

1421
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,990
culture and how it's good for the soil

1422
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,610
and good for the plants and they're in

1423
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:39,779
there and the rise of spheres talk to

1424
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:43,410
each other all that good stuff

1425
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:48,030
do we find that companion planning helps

1426
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:50,309
with the thriving of the water as well

1427
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:52,050
or keeping it balanced or are there

1428
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:54,110
advantages to companion planning to the

1429
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:57,360
to the living water

1430
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,829
you can definitely especially when

1431
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,539
you're coming in to flower if you plant

1432
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,279
them you know about second half of edge

1433
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:03,960
so that they're really starting to take

1434
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,550
off when you're coming into flower can

1435
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,260
really help reduce the nitrogen levels

1436
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:08,820
in the system especially locally around

1437
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,790
the plant which can be really beneficial

1438
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:14,190
for flower and that's probably they

1439
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:15,929
guess the biggest benefit from them we

1440
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,789
also love to do a chamomile which is

1441
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:19,859
another one just because it's such a bug

1442
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:21,329
magnetman right on that's totally cool

1443
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,559
all right let's go ahead and take our

1444
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:24,360
second short break and be right back

1445
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,519
you're listening to shaping fire my

1446
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:29,820
guest today is aquaponic cannabis expert

1447
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:31,739
Steve razor cultivators who grow in

1448
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,539
living soil are very particular on what

1449
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:35,399
inputs they use in their soil they

1450
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,509
educate themselves and painstakingly

1451
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,400
create compo

1452
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:40,440
to nutritive teas to create thriving

1453
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,869
soils that will produce the very best

1454
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,670
expression of the cannabis plant many

1455
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:47,339
living soil farmers now believe that

1456
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:49,260
over time seeds become acclimated to the

1457
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,940
kind of substrate they are grown in for

1458
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,620
example a seed that was bred in

1459
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,240
synthetic fertilizers may not

1460
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:56,039
immediately know what to do in a living

1461
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,589
soil environment slowing their growth

1462
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:00,750
and decreasing yield the regenerative

1463
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:02,850
seed cooperative is a different kind of

1464
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:04,920
seed bank the regenerative seed

1465
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:07,170
cooperative only provide cannabis seeds

1466
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,240

1499
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,170
the best of both worlds

1500
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:27,329
for many greenhouse operators though

1501
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:29,639
building their greenhouse before gaining

1502
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:31,860
insight into how cannabis greenhouses

1503
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:33,420
differ from ornamental crops can be the

1504
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,420
start of a world of hurt

1505
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,760
Eric Branstad and his team at greenhouse

1506
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,800

1507
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,470
technical know-how to help you avoid

1508
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,510
these pitfalls Eric Branstad has been

1509
00:57:43,469 --> 00:57:48,239
helping cannabis growers find locations

1510
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:49,869
design build and equip their greenhouses

1511
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,608
for over a decade

1512
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:53,380

has an impeccable reputation

1516
00:57:57,219 --> 00:58:02,079
for both depth of knowledge and kindness

1517
00:57:59,588 --> 00:58:03,369
and communication you can hear Eric

1518
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,739
explains some of the challenges facing

1519
00:58:03,369 --> 00:58:08,469
cannabis greenhouses and how to overcome

1520
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:11,710
them in episode number 41 of the shaping

fire podcast no matter where I go in the

1522
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:15,880
country good people with smart

1523
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:18,309
backgrounds still are making the mistake

1524
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,380
of building without knowing cannabis and

1525
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:23,048
it causes them to burn through capital

1526
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:25,539
and time fast everyone has their own

1527
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:27,518
failure point for some it is improper

1528
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:29,319
ventilation planning for others it is

1529
00:58:27,518 --> 00:58:31,988
surface temperatures of the building or

1530
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:33,338
the plants leaves or both some folks

1531
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:35,528
that build their greenhouse from scratch

1532
00:58:33,338 --> 00:58:37,239
make really basic errors like placement

1533
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:38,739
of the greenhouse on the property or not

1534
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:40,329
understanding the natural environment

1535
00:58:38,739 --> 00:58:42,639
where the greenhouse sits

1536
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:44,829
some have even built a decent greenhouse

1537
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:46,328
but are inefficient in their deployment

1538
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:48,630
of light deprivation techniques and

1539
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:50,950
never really hit their target yields

1540
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:52,749
it's great when you learn from your

1541
00:58:50,949 --> 00:58:54,968
mistakes but it's even better when you

1542
00:58:52,748 --> 00:58:57,159
learn from the mistakes of others when

1543
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:58,809
you bring on green house advisory group

1544
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:00,728
you will learn from the mistakes of

1545
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:02,319
their many clients and you'll take

1546
00:59:00,728 --> 00:59:04,538
advantage of the best practices

1547
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:06,369
developed by Eric Branstad over his

1548
00:59:04,539 --> 00:59:09,249
years of working with clients just like

1549

you from location development to

00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:32,650
Shango Louis and our guest this week is

1560
00:59:29,619 --> 00:59:35,200
aquaponic cannabis expert Steve Reznor

1561
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:37,239
so during the first two sets we figured

1562
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,848
out what the hell aquaponics are and

1563
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:41,380
during the second set we really got into

1564
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:43,329
what's going on on the science and

1565
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,160
biological levels well here on the third

1566
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:48,160
set we're going to talk about what

1567
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:50,108
happens when things go wrong and you

1568
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:53,228
know Steve from the from the first two

1569
00:59:50,108 --> 00:59:54,578
sets it seems to me that the the biggest

1570
00:59:53,228 --> 00:59:57,848
problem is when things get out of

1571
00:59:54,579 --> 01:00:03,430
balance because just like the soil food

1572
00:59:57,849 --> 01:00:06,130
web when one input category or chemical

1573
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:09,068
category or microbe category when one of

1574
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:14,050
them gets you know to overabundant

1575
01:00:09,068 --> 01:00:16,599
or or or to lacking it it really mess

1576
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:18,760
with the different the different layers

1577
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:21,519
of magnitude the different trophic

1578
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,170
layers of life and then the whole thing

1579
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:25,358
just kind of starts to crash i'm

1580
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:29,318
assuming that this is what happens as

1581
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:31,299
well in aquaponics absolutely and we use

1582
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:34,000
a combination of you know organic

1583
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:36,760
mineral salts as well as working more

1584
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,159
towards fermented inputs as well a big

1585
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,140
shout-out to Patrick from soil King is

1586
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:42,639
that amazing excel sheet over on his

1587
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:45,519
website of all the different mineral

1588
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:47,170
inputs and different plants that you can

1589
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:50,380
mineralize through compost teas or

1590
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:52,150
ferments to extract that and we're doing

1591
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,380
a lot of testing on that now and a

1592
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,730
couple of different facilities that

1593
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,559
we're working with to try and replace

1594
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,260
even some of those minerals that are

1595
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,760
using but we use a lot of you know

1596
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:04,599
potassium silicate and calcium carbonate

1597
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:06,700
for pH up dtpa for iron and then you

1598
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:08,769
know other other you know sulfates and

1599
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:11,139
some other stuff for you know

1600
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:14,380
organically certified of course when

1601
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:16,449
possible to address some of these issues

1602
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:18,250
but for the most part again we're

1603
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:20,379
getting 85 to 90 percent of them with

1604
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:22,929
the aquaponics and just doing very minor

1605
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,519
changes or unlocking them through other

1606
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,078
means like we talked about with the

1607
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:28,298
ferments or T's the way that everyone

1608
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,609
you know is traditionally familiar with

1609
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:33,400
and doing a hybrid of those two really

1610
01:01:30,608 --> 01:01:34,900
is the the solution for those and one of

1611
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,010
the big ways that I guess maybe we're

1612
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,088
different is that we're testing our

1613
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:39,190
nutrients in the aquatic environment

1614
01:01:37,088 --> 01:01:41,230
every two weeks and most of our

1615
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:42,670
facilities that I'm working with some

1616
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,230
people are down to every four weeks just

1617
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:46,539
because it's is down pat with the

1618
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,858
cultivars that they're running but most

1619
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:49,329
people are again every two weeks they're

1620
01:01:47,858 --> 01:01:51,639
sending out their water just to find out

1621
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:53,200
hey what's going on and you know where

1622
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:54,818
are we at with with micronutrients and

1623
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:56,679
we're just making really tiny material

1624
01:01:54,818 --> 01:01:58,210
adjustments so that you know even when

1625
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:01,088
we are dosing with something it's it's

1626
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:03,280
you know 3 or 3 ppm s or 5 ppm s

1627
01:02:01,088 --> 01:02:04,599
different something real small just to

1628
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,790
keep it in range and to keep everything

1629
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,289
rockin because again the fish waste is

1630
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:10,298
providing the vast majority of what we

1631
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:11,679
need we're just amending the little bit

1632
01:02:10,298 --> 01:02:13,929
that we can either put through the fish

1633
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:15,519
or stuff that would be oxidized or you

1634
01:02:13,929 --> 01:02:16,548
know otherwise would be harmful if it

1635
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:19,188
went through that adjuster try

1636
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:23,059
the fish so in my experience aquariums

1637
01:02:19,188 --> 01:02:25,699
go bad quickly now granted you know my

1638
01:02:23,059 --> 01:02:28,160
aquariums you know I probably had thirty

1639
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:32,778
five forty gallon breeder aquariums so

1640
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:36,828
forty gallons is is not a lot of water

1641
01:02:32,778 --> 01:02:38,869
mass if you will total volume to buffer

1642
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:42,309
itself so so if something got out of

1643
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:44,420
whack it really got out of whack quickly

1644
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:48,289
so I got a two-part question for you

1645
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:52,309
number one what is the normal range for

1646
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:54,410
the size of these aquariums even if you

1647
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:58,009
have multiples of them that you're

1648
01:02:54,409 --> 01:03:00,858
you're pulling your water from and does

1649
01:02:58,009 --> 01:03:03,829
the amount of water plus the fact that

1650
01:03:00,858 --> 01:03:06,588
it's filtering to a certain degree

1651
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:08,359
through some amount of soil does that

1652
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:10,670
all just kind of like buffer it all and

1653
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:13,098
and make it way less likely that things

1654
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:15,170
are gonna go bad really quickly because

1655
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:18,609
like every other you know testing every

1656
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:22,159
other week doesn't sound often enough so

1657
01:03:18,608 --> 01:03:24,920
the there's kind of two two parts to

1658
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:27,409
that so one the main systems that I see

1659
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,389
people growing cannabis and is you know

1660
01:03:27,409 --> 01:03:31,399
two IBC systems which is around four

1661
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:33,259
hundred gallons of water for the home

1662
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,568
grower and that's kind of the normal

1663
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:37,818
size I guess that I see the most just

1664
01:03:35,568 --> 01:03:39,889
two of those IBC style aquaponic systems

1665
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:42,018
that there's lots of public information

1666
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:43,548
on and how to build and then for the

1667
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:45,198
commercial systems I'm mostly seeing

1668
01:03:43,548 --> 01:03:48,048
stuff that's in the thirty twenty

1669
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:50,449
thousand gallon to 30,000 gallons size

1670
01:03:48,048 --> 01:03:52,670
systems oftentimes split into either

1671
01:03:50,449 --> 01:03:54,920
five to ten thousand gallon sections

1672
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:56,568
that are that are loops on their own

1673
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,278
that can all be either cross plumbed or

1674
01:03:56,568 --> 01:04:00,318
separated into individual systems

1675
01:03:58,278 --> 01:04:02,420
depending on you know the needs and

1676
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:05,478
desires of the the system operator at

1677
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:09,619
the time but that I guess probably isn't

1678
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:11,058
the the the - the - I guess layouts I

1679
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:12,679
know most of the systems that I'm

1680
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:14,689
designing are right around 10,000

1681
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:17,298
gallons between 8 and 10,000 gallons per

1682
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:20,178
loop which is a sub tanks fish tanks and

1683
01:04:17,298 --> 01:04:22,338
filtration in grow beds and that

1684
01:04:20,179 --> 01:04:25,068
generally provides a you know a 3,000

1685
01:04:22,338 --> 01:04:26,778
square-foot Bay sometimes we'll get

1686
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:28,179
maybe a 4,000 square foot betta again

1687
01:04:26,778 --> 01:04:30,230
depending on the greenhouse dimensions

1688
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:35,420
and so

1689
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:37,909
this this sheer size just slows down the

1690
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:40,909
speed at which any imbalance can

1691
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:42,739
proliferate oh absolutely so the in an

1692
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:45,858
aquarium what happens is that you have a

1693
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:47,809
high nitrogen the ammonia and and fish

1694
01:04:45,858 --> 01:04:49,819
waste build up and cause it gets

1695
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:51,559
converted by microbes into nitrates and

1696
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:54,550
nitrates get higher and higher and

1697
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:57,409
higher and then they can dissolve down

1698
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:59,660
or they end up dissolving the alkalinity

1699
01:04:57,409 --> 01:05:01,848
or dissolved carbonate hardness which

1700
01:04:59,659 --> 01:05:04,338
then when that gets super low causes an

1701
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:07,309
instability in pH and then the pH

1702
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:10,549
crashes which in a very large volume of

1703
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:13,009
water it becomes almost impossible to do

1704
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:14,900
that without having to go to pretty big

1705
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:17,150
extremes I mean it's absolutely possible

1706
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:19,369
but you have to really strip the water

1707
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:21,320
down or use RO water from the beginning

1708
01:05:19,369 --> 01:05:23,358
or or something else that has no

1709
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,920
stability to it but a healthy system

1710
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:27,170
will have carbonates especially if

1711
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:29,329
you're dosing with the right nutrients

1712
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:30,380
you know if you end up low in carbonate

1713
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:33,289
so you can always dose with potassium

1714
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:36,769
bicarbonate again you can get that Alma

1715
01:05:33,289 --> 01:05:38,659
recertified able and and then you're

1716
01:05:36,769 --> 01:05:42,289
adding you know to carbonate sand one

1717
01:05:38,659 --> 01:05:45,489
potassium for everything for every dose

1718
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:49,519
I was thinking about you know the the

1719
01:05:45,489 --> 01:05:51,379
likelihood of the the aquariums to go

1720
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:54,858
south on me and then it occurred to me

1721
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:57,470
that that really the even though the

1722
01:05:54,858 --> 01:06:00,769
aquarium and the fish are there to serve

1723
01:05:57,469 --> 01:06:05,059
the cannabis grow what essentially the

1724
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:08,000
cannabis grow is is a big badass filter

1725
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:10,940
for the aquariums and makes it way way

1726
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,250
less likely than you know a traditional

1727
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:16,480
aquarium to go south on you just because

1728
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:18,980
you have this elaborate living filter

1729
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,630
absolutely the the biggest pitfalls I

1730
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,760
guess the short to go back to what your

1731
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:24,980
original question was is is pH and

1732
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,210
temperature if you're maintaining your

1733
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,650
pH and you're maintaining your

1734
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:29,900
temperature either through heaters or

1735
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,210
chillers or a combination thereof

1736
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:34,460
depending on your climate it's going to

1737
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:36,079
be pretty hard to have an outbreak short

1738
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:39,260
of someone dosing something into the

1739
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:42,430
system it shouldn't be in there or loose

1740
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,430
electrical current or

1741
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:47,190
your neighbor over sprays with

1742
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:50,019
glyphosate but in a commercial facility

1743
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:51,639
yeah it turns the if anyone's curious in

1744
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:55,599
aquaponics glyphosate will turn the

1745
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:57,519
plants ivory from the top down they go

1746
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,079
from green to ivory in about two days

1747
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,579
Wow that sounds really interesting I do

1748
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:04,869
you think I need to pull up a picture of

1749
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:06,400
that online to check that out so so one

1750
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:08,230
more question here but before we move on

1751
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,420
to this new interesting project that

1752
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:12,820
you're working on so you know when we're

1753
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:18,579
talking about soil there are ways that

1754
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:20,860
the soil can no longer allow us to tend

1755
01:07:18,579 --> 01:07:23,139
to it and and what I mean specifically

1756
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:25,570
is we can get a compaction layer right

1757
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:28,659
that becomes hydrophobic and we go to

1758
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:31,030
water and the water just you know goes

1759
01:07:28,659 --> 01:07:32,649
off the the side of the top of the pot

1760
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:35,740
and down the sides and right out the

1761
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:37,630
holes on the bottom and so we are drying

1762
01:07:35,739 --> 01:07:38,649
out our pot because the top layer is

1763
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:41,349
hydrophobic

1764
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:43,389
similarly somebody's pH could get all

1765
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:46,360
screwed up and and we'll get what people

1766
01:07:43,389 --> 01:07:48,039
generally call nutrient lock out and so

1767
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,440
these are these are both ways where

1768
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:54,009
we're trying to do our best for the

1769
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:56,710
plants but the the ecosystem is saying

1770
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:59,080
oh we're too far down this path is there

1771
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:01,869
anything like that in hydroponics is

1772
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:04,739
there a way that the system can can try

1773
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:07,539
to lock you out from making your changes

1774
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:08,859
absolutely so I would say the biggest

1775
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:10,449
similarity with that would be if you

1776
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,769
don't have adequate filtration you could

1777
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:14,019
end up with sludge buildup in your

1778
01:08:11,769 --> 01:08:15,969
stumps and your grow beds and that can

1779
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:17,140
absolutely lock up nutrients and things

1780
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:19,539
like that and one of the ways we

1781
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:22,090
mitigate that is again through healthy

1782
01:08:19,539 --> 01:08:23,680
microbes lactobacillus and other compost

1783
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:26,739
tea amendments but I into your beds

1784
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:28,990
occasionally but also with one of my

1785
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:30,819
favorite creatures we have in system

1786
01:08:28,989 --> 01:08:32,679
which are black worms which if your

1787
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:34,509
aquarium person I'm sure you remember

1788
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,430
those little tiny black rooms you got

1789
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:38,220
the pests or the live feed your tropical

1790
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:40,690
fish well when you put them in your

1791
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:42,220
aquaponic system they love to feed on

1792
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:44,529
the bacteria and things like that they

1793
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:46,810
go in those little little anaerobic

1794
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:48,460
pockets so they'll actually go out and

1795
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,140
seek that out and tunnel through them

1796
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:52,329
and bring oxygenated water into those

1797
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:54,760
and break them up and actually seek out

1798
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:56,500
those areas like little you know

1799
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:59,650
anaerobic he see

1800
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:01,899
missiles that go and break up those

1801
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:03,489
areas so I actually put them in all the

1802
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:05,500
aquaponic beds and they're one of this I

1803
01:09:03,489 --> 01:09:07,659
guess secret weapons I guess that I

1804
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,640
would use say that we use to eliminate

1805
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:11,139
sludge because they do such a good job

1806
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,640
and they'll kind of maintain their

1807
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:14,170
population based on the amount of sludge

1808
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,700
in there and if they end up blowing

1809
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:18,310
through and they have some baby fish

1810
01:09:15,699 --> 01:09:19,539
there great fish food too so you know

1811
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:21,789
they're there they don't really hurt

1812
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:22,930
anything and they're just like a great

1813
01:09:21,789 --> 01:09:24,399
way to clean it along with your red

1814
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:25,509
wigglers and your earthworms that you

1815
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:27,639
would have in your grow beds you can I

1816
01:09:25,509 --> 01:09:29,319
have three different sizes and they can

1817
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,789
break up all that waste and keep

1818
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:33,130
everything nice and flowing and and

1819
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:34,539
again to keep the biologicals going as

1820
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:36,369
long as the dissolved oxygen is high

1821
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:38,470
enough even those worms don't care about

1822
01:09:36,369 --> 01:09:40,479
being submerged right on right on so

1823
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:42,009
let's finish up talking about these cool

1824
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,469
projects you've got going on like your

1825
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:46,960
you have a unique situation because

1826
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:49,750
since you design and design-build

1827
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,819
aquaponics for folks you essentially go

1828
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:54,489
to where the work is it's not like you

1829
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:57,400
have setup where you know where you live

1830
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:58,929
and then you know you set up your grow

1831
01:09:57,399 --> 01:10:01,569
and then you kind of like stay put you

1832
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:03,310
are a traveling guy and so from what I

1833
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:05,199
understand right now you're in Oklahoma

1834
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:06,280
but then you know you've got some great

1835
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,260
news that you're going to share with us

1836
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:10,210
you haven't talked about publicly so so

1837
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,590
why don't you tell us just like what

1838
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:13,449
you're doing in Oklahoma and then a

1839
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:16,569
little bit about this project before we

1840
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:18,279
wrap up sure so I'm here in Oklahoma

1841
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:19,599
there's a couple of different aquaponic

1842
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:22,119
producers out here that I've been

1843
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,950
helping do both design work and an SOP

1844
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:25,180
work and some troubleshooting work for

1845
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:27,550
some guys it got started a little bit

1846
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:29,140
before I came out here and really do it

1847
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:31,539
you know helping get that munch on back

1848
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:33,460
on track and kind of helping the guys

1849
01:10:31,539 --> 01:10:35,829
out here get used to the the normal

1850
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:38,050
regulated market that we've all grown to

1851
01:10:35,829 --> 01:10:40,180
love and Oregon and California and

1852
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:45,039
Washington and you know who doesn't love

1853
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:46,180
hours of paperwork so you know and just

1854
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,519
crossing your eyes and dotting your

1855
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:51,369
cheese and you know doing that whole

1856
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,380
thing but depending on when this episode

1857
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:56,619
airs you'll be the first place to this

1858
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:59,140
guess announced is uh we're gonna be are

1859
01:10:56,619 --> 01:11:00,579
gonna be part of a company I'm gonna

1860
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:02,050
leave out the other people that are on

1861
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:03,609
it just because I don't know when this

1862
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:05,050
is launching because of that part can't

1863
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:06,909
be out before the press release but I

1864
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:08,710
can I got permission to say the rest of

1865
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:10,119
this but we have a company called a

1866
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:13,480
Jillian and we

1867
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:16,119
to have one of the as far as I'm aware

1868
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:18,969
one of the largest we currently have one

1869
01:11:16,119 --> 01:11:21,699
of the largest licenses on the planet we

1870
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:23,560
have in terms of how many thousands of

1871
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:26,979
hectares it is but we're going to begin

1872
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,480
starting in about three or four weeks I

1873
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:30,849
don't know what the yeah about four

1874
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,979
weeks from now we'll begin planting in

1875
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:34,240
South Africa we have one hundred and

1876
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:35,619
forty seven thousand square foot

1877
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,079
facility we're going to be bloating out

1878
01:11:35,619 --> 01:11:40,029
as phase one and then rolling into

1879
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:41,979
thousands and thousands of hectares once

1880
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:44,739
or that facility is basically good a

1881
01:11:41,979 --> 01:11:46,329
function as a nursery for for our

1882
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:47,859
thousands of hectares that we're going

1883
01:11:46,329 --> 01:11:50,619
to be producing out of South Africa

1884
01:11:47,859 --> 01:11:52,809
which is going to be a lot of fun

1885
01:11:50,619 --> 01:11:54,909
it's a lot of fun working on a project

1886
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:56,410
that's this scale and working with some

1887
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:58,960
of the amazing people that are on our

1888
01:11:56,409 --> 01:12:00,460
team we have people that you've had on

1889
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,649
your show before that are part of our

1890
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:04,420
team and it's really going to be awesome

1891
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:06,279
to kind of do something that's not only

1892
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:09,100
large-scale but you know we're

1893
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:10,989
generatively minded and sustainably

1894
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,030
minded but also you know gives back to

1895
01:12:10,989 --> 01:12:15,159
the local community as well we'll be

1896
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:17,019
looking working hand-in-hand with local

1897
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:18,579
farmers and making sure that a lot of

1898
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:19,840
the local farmers as well are getting

1899
01:12:18,579 --> 01:12:21,640
you know a large percentage of the

1900
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,860
profits back into the country and that

1901
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:26,170
it's not just getting exported out of

1902
01:12:23,859 --> 01:12:28,210
there like a normal situation so we'll

1903
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:29,859
have a lot more details coming on out on

1904
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,029
that one in the press release along with

1905
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:32,109
the groups that we're working with and

1906
01:12:31,029 --> 01:12:34,899
some of the other big names that are

1907
01:12:32,109 --> 01:12:37,449
part of the project but I'm super stoked

1908
01:12:34,899 --> 01:12:39,099
on that and will be once the

1909
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:40,809
constructions are on the nursery as far

1910
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:43,000
as I'm aware we'll have allergic largest

1911
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:44,890
aquaponics facility on the planet wow

1912
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,479
that's a good ragging rates right there

1913
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:49,810
and then it's going to be cannabis

1914
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:52,509
that's awesome you know you know what if

1915
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:53,800
you would hit on the equity aspect of it

1916
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:55,989
because you or telling me about that a

1917
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,539
little bit earlier and I still think

1918
01:12:55,989 --> 01:13:00,130
that cannabis equity is is new to a lot

1919
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:02,590
of folks and I think that's a really

1920
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:04,029
interesting aspect of your project sure

1921
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:06,420
so we have a couple of different

1922
01:13:04,029 --> 01:13:10,539
licenses that we have under that but

1923
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:15,190
part of those licenses are half owned by

1924
01:13:10,539 --> 01:13:16,989
the African Farmers Association over

1925
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:19,389
there and so I'm sure I'm mispronouncing

1926
01:13:16,989 --> 01:13:21,099
the actual name of the group again I

1927
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:22,829
don't have the paper in front of me at

1928
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,119
the moment but um well

1929
01:13:22,828 --> 01:13:26,578
we're gonna be donating it to them which

1930
01:13:24,118 --> 01:13:28,408
is going to be awesome so they're they

1931
01:13:26,578 --> 01:13:29,668
own half the license and we'll be

1932
01:13:28,408 --> 01:13:32,098
working hand in hand with their farmers

1933
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:34,618
to get breast practices as well as um

1934
01:13:32,099 --> 01:13:36,208
you know a way for them to export it

1935
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:38,518
back out of there we're also working

1936
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:39,658
with a track and trace program that

1937
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:42,030
we've developed that's going to be part

1938
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:45,658
of our system for that so allow farmers

1939
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:47,309
to get paid directly as well from people

1940
01:13:45,658 --> 01:13:49,529
and even allow people to pay ahead of

1941
01:13:47,309 --> 01:13:51,359
time for those runs you know if you have

1942
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:53,578
a farmer and he's really skilled and you

1943
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:54,689
have someone overseas that wants to put

1944
01:13:53,578 --> 01:13:56,219
money down on their next run because

1945
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:58,439
they thought the last one was bomb and

1946
01:13:56,219 --> 01:14:00,448
was really good this allows people to do

1947
01:13:58,439 --> 01:14:02,039
that and allow these farmers access to

1948
01:14:00,448 --> 01:14:03,779
money that would be totally off limits

1949
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:05,819
or or it would be filtered out by the

1950
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:07,438
guys at the docks or the ports or all

1951
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:09,118
the other 10,000 ways that these guys

1952
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,639
get ripped off that we all know about

1953
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:13,498
and a half of us have had done to

1954
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:15,269
ourselves so it's going to kind of

1955
01:14:13,498 --> 01:14:16,800
streamline all that and move the banking

1956
01:14:15,269 --> 01:14:18,510
directly into that kind of system and

1957
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,309
remove a lot of the potential for the

1958
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:22,859
middlemen and just work out solid

1959
01:14:20,309 --> 01:14:24,689
contracts for transport and simplify and

1960
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:26,369
get rid of a lot of the the riffraff and

1961
01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:28,739
a lot of stuff that both scares away

1962
01:14:26,368 --> 01:14:30,389
investors but also really screws over

1963
01:14:28,738 --> 01:14:31,768
the farmers that are actually the dudes

1964
01:14:30,389 --> 01:14:34,078
that are growing the we that have the

1965
01:14:31,769 --> 01:14:35,458
skills and the knowledge to give us the

1966
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:37,498
medicine that we want in the first place

1967
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:38,819
and we all know how much those guys get

1968
01:14:37,498 --> 01:14:40,708
screwed in these four I mean anyone

1969
01:14:38,819 --> 01:14:42,299
that's been in Jamaica or any of these

1970
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:46,139
other places knows how badly those guys

1971
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,729
get screwed over and and robbed in a lot

1972
01:14:46,139 --> 01:14:49,800
of cases as well so this is going to

1973
01:14:47,729 --> 01:14:52,349
help really break through a lot of that

1974
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,418
and and you know it's going to be really

1975
01:14:52,349 --> 01:14:55,949
awesome so we'll have a facility at both

1976
01:14:54,418 --> 01:14:59,208
in Cape Town and then over in East

1977
01:14:55,948 --> 01:15:01,948
London for phase one and then we have a

1978
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:04,260
rollout and a couple of other areas in

1979
01:15:01,948 --> 01:15:05,788
the Phase two how exciting that's going

1980
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:07,469
to be might you know two things come to

1981
01:15:05,788 --> 01:15:10,078
mind right away is that number one just

1982
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:11,939
the the cool cultural aspects of being

1983
01:15:10,078 --> 01:15:13,648
in South Africa and the beauty and the

1984
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:15,389
different insects and the cool trees and

1985
01:15:13,649 --> 01:15:17,189
the different sunsets and and the

1986
01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:19,050
different smells and like just being

1987
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:21,689
somewhere exotic that's gonna be really

1988
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:24,510
cool but also to be living there for a

1989
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:26,609
while and to get your hands on all these

1990
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:28,320
like varieties of African land races

1991
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:29,969
that you're gonna have your hands on

1992
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:31,648
because you're gonna be meeting cool

1993
01:15:29,969 --> 01:15:33,658
people who live there there are also

1994
01:15:31,649 --> 01:15:35,090
cannabis folks I mean my god dude you've

1995
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:37,488
got to be so excited

1996
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:39,650
oh dude I am super stoked I'm not even

1997
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:41,209
more stoked because the cultivars that

1998
01:15:39,649 --> 01:15:43,219
have been doing the best in Oklahoma

1999
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:45,380
actually have been the malawi the Swazi

2000
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:46,849
and the Durban crosses that we have so

2001
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:48,710
it's been funny that like I've been

2002
01:15:46,849 --> 01:15:50,989
growing those pretty much all summer and

2003
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:53,420
now I'm going to be going and growing

2004
01:15:50,988 --> 01:15:55,399
them again and a couple of weeks here

2005
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:56,809
we're gonna been begin planting November

2006
01:15:55,399 --> 01:15:58,788
first but we got to do a little bit of

2007
01:15:56,809 --> 01:16:00,500
setup and training with the guys what

2008
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:04,309
one interesting thing is when you go to

2009
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:05,840
these more far-flung places as a lot of

2010
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:08,210
times you have to redo all of your

2011
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,880
education material into Ikea directions

2012
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:12,649
because a lot of these guys don't they

2013
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,819
know a little bit of English on reading

2014
01:16:12,649 --> 01:16:14,808
and writing but they don't know a lot of

2015
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:17,029
reading and writing so you have to

2016
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:19,038
basically redo all of your manuals

2017
01:16:17,029 --> 01:16:21,519
instructions and SOPs and is something

2018
01:16:19,038 --> 01:16:24,889
with pictures because or video otherwise

2019
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,349
you can't just rely on not to be forever

2020
01:16:24,889 --> 01:16:28,940
like so a resource so that's definitely

2021
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:31,099
a challenge that I've found especially

2022
01:16:28,939 --> 01:16:33,379
working in Jamaica I ended up going back

2023
01:16:31,099 --> 01:16:35,389
home for a couple weeks and coming back

2024
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:37,819
with my whole DVD collection you know a

2025
01:16:35,389 --> 01:16:42,020
bunch of the Jorge Cervantes DVDs and

2026
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:45,170
mr. mr. green thumb' and all the old go

2027
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:46,340
ones and the vehicle VHS and I gave them

2028
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:48,800
out I was like here watch all these

2029
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:51,078
because frankly they did you know it's

2030
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,639
the easiest way to try and you know wrap

2031
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:55,118
their heads around some of the concepts

2032
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:58,159
that otherwise can be quite difficult to

2033
01:16:55,118 --> 01:16:59,750
explain without having visualizing you

2034
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:01,488
know without visualizing it and that's

2035
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:04,250
been another challenge I found you know

2036
01:17:01,488 --> 01:17:05,538
both in South Africa and working with

2037
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,670
some of the guys down there but also in

2038
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:09,618
Jamaica again it's not like pooh-poohing

2039
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:11,300
them for for not knowing that it's just

2040
01:17:09,618 --> 01:17:12,649
a challenge that comes with the industry

2041
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,270
especially with farmers that have been

2042
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:16,219
you know hey if you're a really good

2043
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:18,650
farmer and you're crushing it and you're

2044
01:17:16,219 --> 01:17:20,480
doing well on food production we you

2045
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:22,429
don't really need to learn to read you

2046
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:23,899
know at any point is if you're trained

2047
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,940
well I mean you obviously you do for

2048
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:27,679
self growth but I mean if point of

2049
01:17:25,939 --> 01:17:29,118
reliance you can get by in a lot of

2050
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,279
parts of the world you know just fine

2051
01:17:29,118 --> 01:17:33,558
yeah I understand that right on dude

2052
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,630
well Steve thank you so much for taking

2053
01:17:33,559 --> 01:17:37,369
your time to share all this with us and

2054
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:40,250
I gotta tell you you know it's it's very

2055
01:17:37,368 --> 01:17:42,589
exciting to find out that you know this

2056
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:45,139
thing that I love this the soil food web

2057
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:48,319
and that I've been studying that now

2058
01:17:45,139 --> 01:17:51,440
there is an equally sized if

2059
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:55,158
deeper and more unstudied rabbit hole to

2060
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:57,500
go down in this water food web and and

2061
01:17:55,158 --> 01:17:59,658
it's just fantastic that you you know

2062
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:01,039
helped us open this door up for a lot

2063
01:17:59,658 --> 01:18:03,500
more people so thanks so much for

2064
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:04,939
sharing your expertise absolutely thanks

2065
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,969
sir thanks for having me on and yeah if

2066
01:18:04,939 --> 01:18:09,738
anyone's a college kid looking for a way

2067
01:18:07,969 --> 01:18:11,899
to make a mark for yourself for a way to

2068
01:18:09,738 --> 01:18:13,279
develop products get into the aquatic

2069
01:18:11,899 --> 01:18:14,710
mineralization stuff there's there's

2070
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:17,590
probably billions of dollars of

2071
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:20,118
microbial products in there you know

2072
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:21,409
worth of research you know it's a wide

2073
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:23,139
open field and something you can

2074
01:18:21,408 --> 01:18:26,629
definitely do well for yourself in and

2075
01:18:23,139 --> 01:18:28,340
and they do you mind if I mentioned the

2076
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,690
podcast you know no go ahead I was gonna

2077
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:33,170
plug it but you go ahead and go yourself

2078
01:18:29,689 --> 01:18:35,928
yeah sure so uh so I also have the

2079
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:38,539
growing with fishes podcast is inspired

2080
01:18:35,929 --> 01:18:40,550
by people such as yourself that go out

2081
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:42,618
there and put out a hardcore education

2082
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:44,060
on and try to get you know the realm

2083
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:46,670
away from the Cheech and Chong and more

2084
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:49,219
into academia and more into science as

2085
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:50,840
much as we love the old old ways doesn't

2086
01:18:49,219 --> 01:18:52,969
really help us get taken as seriously by

2087
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:55,099
the agricultural field and advances and

2088
01:18:52,969 --> 01:18:56,868
you know in the sciences so it's really

2089
01:18:55,099 --> 01:18:59,719
awesome to have you know more science

2090
01:18:56,868 --> 01:19:04,158
oriented podcast and we have a podcast
