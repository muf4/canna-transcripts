1
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:08,669
hey there everybody I am here with Dale

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:11,519
hunt and dr. Ethan Rousseau here the day

3
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,919
before emerald cup here in Santa Rosa

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,469
and I was very pleased that dr. Russo

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,149
reached out to me last week to let me

6
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,739
know that he's got a new project that

7
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,598
he's very excited about and working on

8
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,698
with Dale and he said hey why don't you

9
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:26,099
come by the air B&amp;B on Friday before the

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,130
Emerald cup and we can talk about it

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,379
today on video before they announce the

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,629
new project tomorrow at emerald cops so

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,939
so guys thank you for the invitation and

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,650
I was excited to hear the bit I have

15
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,419
heard so far about the new project I

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,489
think Dale I think you're gonna start

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,310
off by giving us a little bit of context

18
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,730
of the the elevator talk if you will

19
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,790
about what the new project is okay well

20
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,919
as you know I'm a plant scientist who

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,399
became a patent attorney and I've worked

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,829
with plant breeders for my entire career

23
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,739
as I became more and more immersed in

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,798
the cannabis industry I had multiple

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,600
conversations with breeders it would

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,280
they would always follow a similar

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,089
pattern the breeder would tell me about

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,618
something great that they've done and

29
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,299
asked me how it would go about

30
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,118
protecting it and I'd tell them ok

31
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,210
that's easy I know how to do that and

32
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,549
then we would get on to the steps in the

33
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,809
process and the cost and it would become

34
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,710
evident that they were not in any

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,259
position to pay and even if they did pay

36
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:33,658
they they may not have the right

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,459
opportunity to business opportunities to

38
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,990
do anything with the IP once they had it

39
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,298
after a few of these conversations it

40
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:46,099
all kind of went the same way I realized

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,020
that what the industry needs is

42
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:51,780
something like a record company where

43
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,840
the breeder is the singer the song

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,718
writer the artist and you know if you

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,829
think of it of a great musician they

46
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,748
only have to be great at being a

47
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:04,379
musician they don't have to be business

48
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:06,269
people they don't have to be good at the

49
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,528
legal part they just have to be really

50
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,469
good at what they do and they have to

51
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:12,120
have a passion for it and then a good

52
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,159
record company takes care of the rest

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,539
and takes very good care of the music

54
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:21,240
and keeps them happy and make sure they

55
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:24,299
get paid well on and on so I was

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,189
thinking all right we have we have a

57
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,400
population of amazing breeders who have

58
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:35,479
been just devoted to the planet in many

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:37,140
cases for decades and they are not being

60
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,000
there they don't have the right

61
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,509
opportunities to get their work out to

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,909
people out to the world and so we want

63
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:48,449
to do something that can fix that we

64
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:50,699
want to offer them opportunities to

65
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:51,989
protect their intellectual property they

66
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,569
would continue to own the intellectual

67
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,650
property and then this new venture that

68
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:01,379
we're starting which we're calling

69
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:04,439
breeders best is our way of we become

70
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,960
the licensee of the breeder and then we

71
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:10,460
take that license and find the right

72
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,480
partners to cultivate the plant and

73
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,219
create the medicine to create the

74
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,079
products that can be made from these

75
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,409
amazing cultivars that these breeders

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,719
have developed and then they get a

77
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,359
royalty for as long as anyone is buying

78
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,030
the plant or the products or the flower

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,830
or whatever it is that they're buying

80
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,990
all they have to do is be good at

81
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,190
breeding and all right it's our goal

82
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,020
that we would take care of the rest

83
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:36,509
one of the things that I find really

84
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,240
attractive about this business model is

85
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:41,849
that the ownership of the intellectual

86
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,350
property of the plant genetics stays

87
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,719
with the original breeder

88
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,650
it doesn't change hands to you you are

89
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:52,289
simply licensing it to them instead of

90
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,060
you becoming the owner and so if I

91
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,219
understand it right if you ever find

92
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,239
yourself in a position where you're not

93
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:02,729
able to make royalties for the original

94
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,980
breeder that they can go ahead and take

95
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,750
it and go on to their next venture with

96
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,659
it yeah does that understand these

97
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,090
represent correct yeah I think and that

98
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,650
may be different from the model of at

99
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,459
least some record companies I think they

100
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,168
do end up acquiring the rights I don't

101
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,459
know who ends up owning the copy right

102
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,649
it's probably depends on the company but

103
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,350
we I think it's really important that

104
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:28,379
the breeder continued on the I

105
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,069
we're in an industry in a culture where

106
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:35,310
there a lot of trust issues and it's

107
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:39,090
it's just it erases one potential

108
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,598
question one potential problem we will

109
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:44,638
do our will will do great with the

110
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:48,300
opportunity to have a license to their

111
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,500
IP but if we don't find a good a good

112
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,020
outlet for it or we don't we're not able

113
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,759
to meet the minimums that we build into

114
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:58,709
the agreement then that will revert back

115
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,030
to them the rights though the ownership

116
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,168
will always be with him but the rights

117
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:06,448
would revert back to them and they could

118
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:08,490
do something else with it so even I know

119
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:11,460
you have been a big proponent for a

120
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,819
whole plant medicine for all time and

121
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:16,348
and as as we see pharmaceutical

122
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,598
companies coming in contact with the

123
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:20,219
canvas plant more they seem to be

124
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:23,848
reverting to these solutions that are

125
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,789
all single molecule breaking up the

126
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:29,098
plant taking it into its discrete parts

127
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:30,750
and then kind of making a cocktail and

128
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:33,418
and hoping that they can get FDA

129
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,800
approval for it and and you've never

130
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:37,799
really taken a shine to that approach

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,530
would you explain for us why it's so

132
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,310
important in your eyes to work on whole

133
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:45,869
plant medicine to the degree that you're

134
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:50,879
taking on this big project with Dale

135
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:53,579
sure well I felt for many years that the

136
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,848
real key to botanical medicine medicine

137
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:59,370
from plants the strength of it lies in

138
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:01,288
the synergy the boosting of ingredients

139
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,280
what's come to be known as the entourage

140
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:07,620
effect so this is the idea that we have

141
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:12,299
soloists to carry on the musical analogy

142
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:15,629
perhaps THC and CBD their medical

143
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,968
attributes are greatly enhanced by the

144
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:20,189
addition of these other components and

145
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:23,610
then extract say from the plant as

146
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:27,300
opposed to single molecules so for

147
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,129
example CBD is a great medicine but what

148
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,629
we're finding is for certain

149
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,849
occasions like treating seizure

150
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:36,959
disorders of schizophrenia that huge

151
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:39,538
doses are necessary and this poses two

152
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:43,139
problems one is cost and availability

153
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:45,178
and the other is the possibility of drug

154
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,968
drug interactions at these very high

155
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:51,208
doses as I'm fond of saying there's

156
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:53,819
nothing that cannabidiol does that isn't

157
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:57,088
enhanced by having at least a little bit

158
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,718
of THC with it not to mention the

159
00:06:57,088 --> 00:07:03,300
enhancements that can come from a full

160
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:06,058
panoply of terpenoids that can

161
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,490
contribute to the beneficial effects and

162
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:11,279
also reduce any side effects of other

163
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,800
cannabinoids so this is the approach

164
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:16,439
that I've always espoused on as you

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,899
mentioned we're seeing divergence in the

166
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,789
industry where many companies are going

167
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:24,569
in the other direction and trying to

168
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:27,568
make CBD isolettes or worse in my

169
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:31,679
opinion trying to teach east how to make

170
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:34,468
this in the lab on right now I think

171
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:36,989
it's the science is fascinating but to

172
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:40,228
scale that up they're gonna end up with

173
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,399
a very expensive product no doubt and it

174
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:45,508
will never have the breadth of

175
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:48,749
capabilities that have properly

176
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:50,968
constituted cannabis extract well and I

177
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:53,490
firmly believe that so let's talk about

178
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:56,360
that goal of that that full bodied

179
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,860
cannabis extract for a moment because

180
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,889
you know we understand what single

181
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,449
molecule concoctions would be like but

182
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,218
then when we talk about whole plant

183
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,559
medicine I don't have as clear as a

184
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:10,889
picture means certainly many of us are

185
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:14,369
doing you know full ethanol extractions

186
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:16,439
and and we've been using that for a wide

187
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,999
variety of ailments especially cancer

188
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:21,599
patients for years now in the

189
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:23,849
underground right so so is it that is it

190
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,348
that same kind of picture that that we'd

191
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:29,550
be using these new plants for

192
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:32,668
essentially removing the resin from the

193
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,948
trichomes and using it as it is in the

194
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:37,288
plant or that's just a beginning place

195
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:40,049
and then you process it from there well

196
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:40,620
it could be processed but really the key

197
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,228
is

198
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,389
the genetics that express the profile

199
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,639
that you want for maximum therapeutic

200
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:51,830
effect and I would mention the same

201
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,669
thing applies to better recreational

202
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,730
concoctions

203
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:58,829
you know if the question were do I think

204
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,149
that we can make better medicine or

205
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,910
better

206
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:07,199
don't use cannabis I'm absolutely

207
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:10,189
convinced of it so I have an idea in my

208
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,490
mind oftentimes of what the best

209
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:17,370
biochemical profile would be for a given

210
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:20,370
condition or a given desired effect and

211
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,330
what we're trying to do in breeders best

212
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,100
is see if we can make those available

213
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,950
what we're seeing in the industry is a

214
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,620
genetic bottleneck and this is really a

215
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,820
byproduct of prohibition that for

216
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,190
decades the premium has been on high THC

217
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,950
to exclusion of everything else what

218
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:45,330
we've ended up with out there is

219
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:48,778
primarily high THC products with high

220
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:52,800
Mersin so very prone to produce couch

221
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:56,129
lock but not optimal in any sense from

222
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:59,278
therapeutic standpoint especially safe

223
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:01,649
for the pain patient that might need to

224
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,629
work or study they're not going to

225
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,838
function well on that kind of profile

226
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:09,689
then about ten years ago CBD became

227
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,470
popular as a target for breeding but we

228
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:15,510
ended up with high CBD and high mersin

229
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,899
creating the mistaken notion that CBD is

230
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:22,309
sedating and it really is not but we're

231
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:27,028
really looking for distinct targets

232
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:29,219
emphasizing better profiles perhaps tea

233
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:30,778
high THC with other terpenoids

234
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,810
predominant there aren't going to be

235
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:37,019
sedating that allow people to

236
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:40,679
concentrate and work that can elevate

237
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:42,659
mood particularly in patients who have a

238
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,689
chronic condition and may be depressed

239
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:46,259
from that additionally we're really

240
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,389
interest

241
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,209
and what people now call minor

242
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:53,668
cannabinoids that he haven't been

243
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,228
available and haven't had the

244
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:58,139
opportunity to show their full

245
00:10:55,229 --> 00:11:03,509
therapeutic potential and I just would

246
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:06,509
cite cannabidiol CVG as a cannabinoid

247
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:08,909
that I think is extremely promising from

248
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,798
a medical standpoint and the vast

249
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:13,259
majority of people that may have used

250
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:16,259
cannabis for decades I've had no

251
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,199
exposure to it so we've talked about

252
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:22,470
before when you've been on the podcast

253
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:23,849
that you see many pharmaceutical

254
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,850
companies moving towards these single

255
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,859
molecule solutions and and when you when

256
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,069
you review their final product you're

257
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:34,739
like so this combination may be good but

258
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:37,498
our goal really should be to breed a

259
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:39,809
plant that is exactly that so that

260
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:42,209
instead of manufacturing it in a lab

261
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:44,698
we're just going to grow this plant and

262
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:48,088
then extract from the plant that the the

263
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:49,378
whole the entirety of the oil and then

264
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,879
and then you don't have to do additional

265
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,889
manufacturer you don't put it in a

266
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:58,470
capture or whatever and and and hand it

267
00:11:52,889 --> 00:12:01,649
on to the patient what types of plants

268
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,288
are you looking for for breeders to

269
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,568
start bringing you right because I'm

270
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:08,519
sure that you know there are breeders

271
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:11,428
who are who have got their life work

272
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,499
right you know in the grow room and they

273
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:16,350
just haven't felt safe to take it

274
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:18,389
anywhere and so now you know perhaps

275
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,699
they'll consider breeders best as an

276
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,769
option but how do they know whether or

277
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,958
not that they should even reach out to

278
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,659
you what are you looking for sure well

279
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:31,108
you know the place to start does not

280
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:33,298
just that hey I've grown something that

281
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:35,220
I think is really good we need a little

282
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:39,509
more science behind it and that comes

283
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,730
from Co a certificates of analysis so on

284
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:47,548
a basic level what we'd be looking for

285
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:50,370
is either TC predominant CBD predominant

286
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:53,669
plants but with profiles other than

287
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,259
nursing so we're interested in plants

288
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,809
that would have a good expression of

289
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:01,259
other terpenoids whether carry awfully

290
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:05,419
linalool limonene pining any of these

291
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:08,580
would be of interest and then certainly

292
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:11,719
type two plants with a balance of THC

293
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:15,410
and CBD with the same kind of profiles

294
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,320
CBG predominant plants and THC v

295
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:21,838
predominant plants or by chance if

296
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,000
somebody has a cannabic Romijn cbc

297
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,810
predominant plant that's a recessive

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,339
gene don't see a lot of it normally so

299
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:31,889
any of these would be of great interest

300
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:37,170
and would be very promising in future

301
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:39,960
Commerce so so Dale let's say that

302
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:42,240
somebody is watching and they have one

303
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,070
of these plants something that's got

304
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,750
unique characteristics that kind of

305
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,420
generally falls within the boundaries

306
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:53,070
that that dr. Russo is explaining to us

307
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:54,870
what would it look like so so I'm

308
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,070
assuming that will give them the contact

309
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,709
information at the end so they make

310
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,540
contact and you talk with them what

311
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,969
would be the steps of kind of bringing

312
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,370
them in so that we can give people a

313
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:09,240
picture of how they be treated yeah

314
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:11,370
well first of all we have to I have to

315
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,740
tap into expertise that it's not mine it

316
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,820
would be Ethan's and some other people

317
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:21,560
that were going to involve to be able to

318
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,089
have some confidence that that this

319
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:26,969
particular genetic combination has a lot

320
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:30,330
of promise we're a new company were

321
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:32,129
still you know pre funding and so we

322
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,778
won't be able to throw massive resources

323
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:36,120
and everything that comes our way we'll

324
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:38,549
have to focus on a few of the very most

325
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,539
promising at first as we learn how to

326
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:45,389
walk and then run but yeah so the idea

327
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:47,099
is if we if we find something that seems

328
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,870
interesting then we would have we would

329
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,220
and it would be would have been

330
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,549
submitted by the breeder in the first

331
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,320
place so they've expressed some interest

332
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:56,759
we would go back to them and say yeah it

333
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,200
looks like this is something we want to

334
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,210
work on with you

335
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:05,800
we will file

336
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:07,389
patent protection no this is at any cost

337
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,490
to them with filed provisional patent

338
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,990
protection this will give us a year -

339
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,090
you've got the graters nay and the

340
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,430
breeders name absolutely it'll always be

341
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:18,610
in a breeders name and owned by the

342
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:20,259
breeder but during that provisional year

343
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,389
we would have an opportunity to evaluate

344
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,879
it more more thoroughly evaluated

345
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:28,259
chemically and horticulturally to make

346
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:32,439
sure that it really is viable as as a

347
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:34,389
real plant that you can put into larger

348
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,810
scale production and bring to more

349
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:41,470
markets more people if we get through

350
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:43,000
that well and then of course part of

351
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,190
this is we make and we make an agreement

352
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,120
with the breeder the breeder needs his

353
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:52,110
or her own attorney if they need help

354
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,129
identifying an attorney or paying for it

355
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,899
we wouldn't be the ones to try to

356
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:58,450
identify an attorney we want that to be

357
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,699
completely independent decision but I

358
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,830
think there's some there are some very

359
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,500
good attorneys and the international

360
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,120
cannabis Bar Association has some good

361
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,179
ones to choose from they're completely

362
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,909
independent of us but we would make an

363
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:17,199
agreement that would specify a royalty

364
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:18,759
rate and the other things that need to

365
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,580
be specified so that they have

366
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,080
confidence that they have the right kind

367
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,550
of protection and their attorney gets to

368
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,020
review that to make sure that they get

369
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:28,089
advice telling them that yeah this is

370
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:31,419
this is not biased in their favor this

371
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:34,840
is a fair deal both ways and then we go

372
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:37,209
to work evaluating it if after that

373
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,940
first year or sometime during that first

374
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,070
year it looks like it's a go then we

375
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,500
would do a more long-term definitive

376
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:48,510
agreement with guaranteed minimum annual

377
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:51,370
royalties a specified royalty rate and

378
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:53,649
full IP protection again in the breeders

379
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,350
name did you say guaranteed minimum

380
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,129
royalties yes now what that's pretty

381
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,920
much it

382
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:02,259
yeah and guaranteed that that can sound

383
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,909
imprudent a guaranteed minimum royalty

384
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,289
I've done a lot of plant licensing and

385
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:07,779
what you do with a guaranteed minimum

386
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:11,740
royalty in most of these situations is

387
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:14,859
you you're telling the the breeder or

388
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,679
whatever the partner is we think the

389
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:19,328
we can with our diligence that we can

390
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,610
produce enough revenue that we can pay

391
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:25,230
you this as your royalty and hopefully a

392
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:27,938
lot more than that if we ever don't then

393
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,679
the exclusivity of our agreement goes

394
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,710
away and we become a non-exclusive

395
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,298
licensee or in some cases we lose our

396
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,690
license entirely and all the rights

397
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:39,519
revert back to the breeder that's a way

398
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,230
one of the things I've learned in doing

399
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,269
intellectual property licensing is if

400
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,099
you give someone an exclusive license to

401
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:47,650
something whether it's a plant variety

402
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:50,639
or whatever thing you have you're

403
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:53,919
betting on them to do all the work and

404
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,169
that's a risk and if you but if they'll

405
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,540
make a if they'll give you a guaranteed

406
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:00,130
minimum then they're they're putting

407
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:01,690
some skin in the game and they've got a

408
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,910
they've got to do the work they've got

409
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,140
to make it happen and then if they if

410
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,910
things just don't turn out the way they

411
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,640
thought it would and you know then the

412
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,009
way to back out of that in a way that's

413
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,290
that's not does it doesn't have to be

414
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,490
combative or adversarial is to say you

415
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:16,928
know we're sorry we're not going to be

416
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,150
able to maintain the exclusivity of

417
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:22,210
these rights we we can't make enough

418
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,340
money to pay this royalty that doesn't

419
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,410
mean that the breeders just left with no

420
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:27,879
options the breeder has intellectual

421
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,669
property that belongs to them

422
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,530
they've got either still a non-exclusive

423
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:35,140
license with us so we can still try to

424
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:37,029
make money for them and then they can

425
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,790
also with since it's not exclusive it

426
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:42,190
can go do what they want to do also so I

427
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:44,259
like I really like the fact that the

428
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,539
ownership remains with the original

429
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:50,079
breeder which gives them a lot more

430
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:51,490
safety and and I'm both surprised and

431
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,990
think it's pretty cool that you're

432
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:58,750
approaching this minimum royalty amount

433
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:02,109
but you know in in this in this post

434
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,849
Philo's debacle world there's not a lot

435
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:05,798
of people throwing around trusts right

436
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:09,069
now when it comes to the breeding scene

437
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,869
right so so let's talk a little bit more

438
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:14,289
about protections for the breeders

439
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:18,039
themselves the first year when when you

440
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:20,139
wrap up the IP while you can do your due

441
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:24,789
diligence to make sure that that it's

442
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:26,919
really an appropriate target plant what

443
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,528
does that agreement look like

444
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,840
what what protections are in it for the

445
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:34,058
breeder to know that you're not

446
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,949
I don't know scrolling away the genetics

447
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:38,048
and then you're gonna say oh it's not

448
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,880
the right plant and then and they go

449
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:40,509
away and then you go ahead and use it

450
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,480
anyway

451
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:45,460
that's a great question typically a good

452
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,880
intellectual property license has audit

453
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:52,269
rights where there's the the license or

454
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,240
the one that owns the rights has the the

455
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:57,069
right built into the agreement to walk

456
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,370
in at any time and inspect or have

457
00:19:57,069 --> 00:20:02,970
someone do that for them in addition one

458
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:07,449
of the things that is I think especially

459
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:10,210
good or attractive about intellectual

460
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:13,389
property licenses were relating to

461
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,919
actual plant cultivars is that if

462
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:15,189
someone ever tried to do something like

463
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,919
that

464
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,830
you're a very simple DNA test away from

465
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,570
proving that you know these guys that

466
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:24,158
told me they weren't keeping any of my

467
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:29,439
plants kept some of my plants that's a

468
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,940
super super feasible test maybe this

469
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,370
isn't theoretical you've done this with

470
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,440
a wide range of other types of plants so

471
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:38,339
this isn't like iffy science this is

472
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,929
very clear science absolutely clear and

473
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:43,000
because there has been a lot of activity

474
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:46,509
in cannabis sequencing and cannabis

475
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,909
mapping it's it's very accessible to

476
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:51,339
this kind of genetic testing I'm not

477
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:54,880
saying it's it's cheap or it happens

478
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:56,259
overnight but if if anyone ever could if

479
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,600
they had a concern that that had

480
00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:00,638
happened it would be impossible to hide

481
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:06,038
it and so I think that's one of the

482
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:07,538
reasons that that it you know it's great

483
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:08,648
if you can ask people to trust you but

484
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:10,720
it's even better if you can say you

485
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:12,729
don't have to trust me we're transparent

486
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,950
here's your recourse here your opera

487
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,230
here here's how you are protected and

488
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,669
you don't even have to believe us you've

489
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,710
got your own attorney to walk through

490
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:23,710
this with you and and hold us

491
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:27,639
accountable and I think transparency and

492
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,500
accountability are essential in any any

493
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:31,449
business where where you want to

494
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,869
engender trustworthiness it starts with

495
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,990
transparency and accountability even you

496
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:39,250
know I know you as a neurologist and a

497
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,589
cannabis researcher at research

498
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,190
but also as a neighbor on Vashon Island

499
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:45,308
where you're a serious horticulturist

500
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,730
horticulturalist

501
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:52,359
and a member of the FERC Club and and

502
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:55,929
you know I know your perspective goes

503
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,449
beyond the law aspects and beyond just

504
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,009
the medical medical benefits you're a

505
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,819
plant nerd you know you're into the

506
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:07,390
plant and you know what would be your

507
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:09,879
message to breeders who are watching to

508
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,830
encourage them to come out because you

509
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,809
know we all know that there are these

510
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:16,869
breeders who have not stepped out of the

511
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:20,710
shadows with their life's work plant yet

512
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:22,449
because you know it's it's it's super

513
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,360
aggressive and people are getting taken

514
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:28,750
advantage of all the time and and part

515
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:31,119
of the challenge for you both of you

516
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,950
with breeders best is going to to really

517
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,918
convince people that this is a safe

518
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,808
haven for real plant people so so what

519
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,429
would your message to them be to kind of

520
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:42,339
help folks to get over the hump to reach

521
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:45,009
out what's a number of things first I'm

522
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:47,558
committed to this there are lots of

523
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:49,419
things I could do with my time if I'd

524
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:51,308
been a smart businessman I would have

525
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:54,400
stayed in Neurology practice and had

526
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:57,279
tired of the golf course 15 years ago my

527
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,850
colleagues but that had zero attraction

528
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:03,339
so that's one thing but in urdu the

529
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:06,189
breeders or the plant people i'd say hey

530
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:09,069
you know i consider myself one of you or

531
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm a wannabe at least I've been an

532
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:17,859
organic farmer since 1974 I used to run

533
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:21,298
I had the one of the first Montana

534
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:24,668
certified organic farms and sold

535
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:28,960
vegetables at the farmers market so I I

536
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:31,600
know I knew their eighth oh and I

537
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,179
appreciate their values I met a lot of

538
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:38,619
these people I realize their quality as

539
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,390
individuals and what they're trying to

540
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:43,029
achieve so I think it's a matter of

541
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:46,780
common goals and certainly if we have

542
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:49,029
the opportunity to talk one-on-one I

543
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:52,000
would like to emphasize why I think that

544
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:55,839
this is a good Avenue for them the other

545
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,269
aspect is over the course of 23 years of

546
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:02,379
working in the cannabis space I've seen

547
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:06,339
how I think it should not be done so I

548
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:08,710
would like to contribute to finding a

549
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:11,889
better way and certainly a big part of

550
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:15,759
that is finding the breeding targets

551
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:19,240
that we need to make better medicine so

552
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,640
once you find these plants and the

553
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,190
breeder partners and you've run your

554
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,340
tests and and all the ink is dried on

555
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:31,480
the paper is the plan to take these oils

556
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:34,569
and take them down a pharmaceutical FDA

557
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,120
route or is it more to take it and and

558
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:39,129
and put them out as medical products but

559
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,169
in what we're thinking about now is a

560
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,270
recreational market sure well you know

561
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,480
there are multiple possibilities that's

562
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:49,960
one of the strengths of this approach so

563
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,630
as it is now the growers probably using

564
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,880
his or her material themselves or

565
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:58,240
sharing with friends some of these

566
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,250
people have found a market in California

567
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,430
but that's been extremely difficult to

568
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:06,309
because of the stringent regulations

569
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:11,470
that are attached to the legal program

570
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:13,000
in in California so already with 40

571
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,980
million people this is one of the

572
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,650
greatest cannabis markets in the world

573
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,200
but I'd emphasized that what we're

574
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:22,990
trying to do applies to people in other

575
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,080
states other countries and we would

576
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:28,180
really like to see this to be an

577
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:31,990
international movement but to

578
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:35,230
specifically answer your question there

579
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:40,079
material might go to a dispensary is

580
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:44,460
flower or we might want to process into

581
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:48,639
nice extracts that are done ethically

582
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,700
clean extracts using a variety of

583
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,239
techniques but addition

584
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:58,778
I'm also working with pharmaceutical

585
00:25:55,239 --> 00:26:02,710
company that needs better profiles and

586
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:05,319
so this could provide the breed stock if

587
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,538
you will for pharmaceutical development

588
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:11,470
and obviously that's potentially

589
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:15,819
extremely lucrative for the licensee so

590
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:17,798
I see endless potential to this so Dale

591
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:20,918
you know we've all heard horror stories

592
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:23,288
about somebody having a specialty plan

593
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:26,409
and they give it to their one friend

594
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:28,929
with the promise of them not sharing it

595
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:32,289
they swear right and then and then the

596
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:36,548
cut gets out right and and there's a

597
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:40,118
there's a perceived loss how does it

598
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:42,368
work at this level say for example if

599
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:45,418
you're if you're licensing the plant

600
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:49,658
material to be grown by a third party or

601
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:52,330
if you are licensing the IP or plant

602
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:55,929
material to a pharmaceutical company in

603
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:58,808
what matters is that kept safe because

604
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:00,340
because breeders have good reason to to

605
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:03,099
be watching out for getting ripped off

606
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:06,699
right and and many of us don't

607
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:10,358
understand how these protections work at

608
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,069
a you know seven eight figure level

609
00:27:10,358 --> 00:27:14,108
right yeah so would you would you just

610
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:16,058
explain that for us so so we all get a

611
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:18,579
better picture on on how that's

612
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:20,378
protected so they're so they're not

613
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:23,048
gonna get ripped off with you getting

614
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:26,288
ripped off by the end by the licensee

615
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:28,179
right well they're I think there are

616
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:30,308
three layers of protection and they're

617
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,850
all really important one of the layers

618
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:35,558
is just a physical physical layer that

619
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:37,689
anyone that we work with where we put

620
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:39,940
these valuable genetics they will have

621
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,970
to have the right kind of security now

622
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,970
that's never perfect and so that's the

623
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,829
the main reason the reason we're filing

624
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,600
patents is not just because I'm a patent

625
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:52,058
attorney it's because when something

626
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,949
slips out you need to be able to have

627
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:56,648
recourse regardless of whether the

628
00:27:53,950 --> 00:28:00,129
person knew that what they received was

629
00:27:56,648 --> 00:28:02,288
stolen reviewed you don't you you don't

630
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,649
want to have to trace the provenance of

631
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:04,730
some planet if

632
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,840
know that it's yours and it's

633
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,099
patent-protected then you can either

634
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,559
take the party that's using the plant

635
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:14,209
without authorization and sign them up

636
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,019
as a licensee so that they're paying

637
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:21,620
money into that Breeders royalty rate or

638
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:24,259
total royalty or you get them to stop

639
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:27,319
doing it and so you've got to have

640
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:29,180
physical security you patent protection

641
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,799
is really important because it does give

642
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,190
you that last line of defense in case

643
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,599
plants do slip out but then the one that

644
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,630
people don't talk about as much is

645
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,899
having very strong agreements with

646
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,760
everybody involved and this is a lot of

647
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,400
the work that I've done you know I would

648
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:48,410
think in some ways protecting the

649
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,000
getting the IP protection is the easy

650
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,410
part

651
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,640
crafting finding the right partners and

652
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,800
crafting the right kinds of agreements

653
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,720
so that no one's burdened by the

654
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,039
agreement but that everyone's protected

655
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,120
by the way the agreement is structured

656
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:06,409
super important so when we do you know

657
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:08,629
as I mentioned the you know we're the

658
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,180
breeders licensee but then these other

659
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,110
parties are gonna be sub licensees under

660
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,610
under our rights from the reader and

661
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:19,039
those agreements that we that we have

662
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:20,779
with them will specify it very clearly

663
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,690
what they can and cannot do with the

664
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:25,940
planet and as well as what kind of

665
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,370
security they need to maintain and all

666
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,990
of this is meant just just to protect

667
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:34,039
the value that the breeder has created

668
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:36,440
with his or her life's work and we we

669
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:38,029
have to work with with partners probably

670
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,870
all over the world I've done that with

671
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:43,430
other kinds of plants all over the world

672
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:44,899
if you want to get good medicines or

673
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:49,130
good products out to a lot of people

674
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,450
you've got to kind of trust you've got

675
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,010
to find people that are as trustworthy

676
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,950
as possible to work with but then you

677
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:56,210
you fill the gaps in the trust with good

678
00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:01,940
agreements and good intellectual

679
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:03,470
property protection so so let's say that

680
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,920
there's some people they're excited

681
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:09,950
right and and they want to reach out and

682
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:12,680
we know that you are you're at this

683
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:14,430
nexus point right now where you are

684
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,560
fundraising active

685
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:19,660
but you're also trying to source plants

686
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:21,970
at the same time so that they kind of

687
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,800
come together at the same time that you

688
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,319
start cashing these checks from

689
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:30,009
investors and you have some plants to

690
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,990
work with what kind of time frames are

691
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:33,819
we looking for do you do you want people

692
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:37,930
to reach out to you now it's like is it

693
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:40,089
time to like you know call now yeah it

694
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,100
is as long as we just we just hope that

695
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:45,069
they'll be patient with us because we

696
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:47,349
some parts of this come at almost no

697
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:50,139
cost you know we we're all committed to

698
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:53,169
this we can look at a CoA we can we can

699
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:55,780
we can do some of that analysis without

700
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,730
having to spend money but a lot of it

701
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:00,849
you know once we find a propagation

702
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,620
partner or once we start doing some of

703
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:06,069
the other things to really prepare this

704
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:11,019
to get it out to people that will cost

705
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:13,569
money and so we we want every breeder

706
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:15,639
who has something special to trust us to

707
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:19,869
feel like they can trust us enough to

708
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:21,250
send us in to fill out our form we have

709
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:23,619
a form that I'll describe in a minute

710
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,690
and to tell us about what they've got

711
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:27,369
and let us begin to evaluate it but I

712
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,600
just I hope that they will be patient

713
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:31,089
that many of them have waited a long

714
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,639
time and if they'll wait for us to

715
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:36,490
really be all set up to do this really

716
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,290
well then hopefully we'll be able to

717
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:41,170
reward their patients with some really

718
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:44,950
great performance on our part but we are

719
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:47,410
starting we have already three special

720
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,630
cultivars signed up two letters of

721
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,310
non-binding letters of intent because

722
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,220
you know these people haven't had a

723
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,480
chance yet to have an attorney review an

724
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,650
agreement we haven't actually written

725
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,599
the agreement so we have letters of

726
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,340
intent saying hey we want to do this you

727
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:04,179
want to do this we're gonna give this a

728
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:05,679
go we will be turning those into and

729
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,450
we've filed a provisional patent

730
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,100
protection on all of those but we'll be

731
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,490
turning these into definitive agreements

732
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:15,669
and write checks which will be nice as

733
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:18,099
part of this - is it when we do a deal

734
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,019
with the breeder they will get some kind

735
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:22,629
of an advance on the royalties just as a

736
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:23,680
kind of this is how serious we are we're

737
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,810
writing you a check

738
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,320
you know they won't retire on that check

739
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:29,779
but if

740
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:32,240
it's been a stick in the eye yes I

741
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:34,879
checked that well cash is not bad right

742
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,950
on and in addition to breeders I mean

743
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,540
since you are actively fundraising and

744
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,250
and and you know I know that you've been

745
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,509
talking to these folks already and and

746
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,269
some of those checks are even in the

747
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:45,589
mail if there are people who are

748
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:47,509
watching because you know there's a lot

749
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:49,599
of decision makers and investors that

750
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:52,940
that watch shaping fire and follow along

751
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,799
are you interested in incoming contact

752
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,950
from people with money to invest as well

753
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,409
sure yeah yeah I mean I'd welcome the

754
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,779
opportunity and I'd like to be able to

755
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:05,509
explain why I think this is so important

756
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:09,019
and it really again represents a

757
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:12,710
distinct approach to the problems in the

758
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:15,440
cannabis industry we have now over 200

759
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,750
licensed producers in Canada but for the

760
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,710
most part they're dealing with the same

761
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:23,539
genetics and the same profiles and it is

762
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,240
just not the case that they're all going

763
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:29,599
to survive what we need is a more

764
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,750
focused approach with distinct team of

765
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:35,209
ours and I think that breeders best

766
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,660
presents the opportunity for this to

767
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,670
happen and again to make better medicine

768
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,259
and I'd like to just add to that

769
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,600
something that I'm really excited about

770
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:46,759
with this is I was having a conversation

771
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,949
at MJ bisque on just yesterday with

772
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:51,079
someone who said well I have plant

773
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,150
breeders I am you know what's the

774
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:56,089
difference between my employee plant

775
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:58,640
breeders and these breeders and I said

776
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:01,669
well these guys are these men and women

777
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,430
are independent they own their IP those

778
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:06,680
are two big ones right there but I also

779
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,710
said no matter how much technology you

780
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,960
have and how great your plant readers

781
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:16,128
are you've got maybe three or four or

782
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:18,019
five I see our connection with the

783
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:20,389
breeder community which I hope we will

784
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:25,519
we have and we are committed to living

785
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:28,460
up to we have a vast army of breeder

786
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,289
capacity out there that can look at

787
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,179
Ethan's wish list and make it happen

788
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:34,599
some of the moment they might already

789
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:36,929
have what he wants to bring to the world

790
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,288
in their greenhouse or on their show

791
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:43,528
if not instead of just asking a couple

792
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:45,690
breeders to work on it we're saying hey

793
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:47,940
here's an opportunity if this interests

794
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,250
you take your passion take your

795
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:54,480
independence and do something great with

796
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:58,369
it and it'll help a lot of people so I

797
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,079
love the whole decentralized independent

798
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:03,000
it's the biggest R&amp;D department in the

799
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,798
history of Medicine crowd sourcing yeah

800
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,068
your your crowd sourcing at it's at its

801
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:09,480
most pure it we really are and we I see

802
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:11,880
it as an opportunity to help a lot of

803
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,599
people in a lot of different ways so

804
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:19,430
Dale so let's say that somebody is a

805
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,990
breeder or an investor would you outline

806
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:26,129
how you would like them to get in

807
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:27,868
contact with you and then also if you're

808
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,940
at Emerald Cup this weekend they're

809
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:32,190
gonna have a booth and when how could

810
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,048
they come by and talk with you either at

811
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,039
the booth or how do they get ahold of

812
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,829
you via the Internet

813
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,960
yes we will have a booth it's a corner

814
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:41,339
booth from the hall of flowers I wrote

815
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,179
it down in this way over there I think

816
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:47,400
it's 892 but it will have a giant sign

817
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:49,429
870 872 it I'll put it in the I'll put

818
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,108
in the description below okay thank you

819
00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:55,139
we also have a website that has just

820
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:57,900
gone like today on the website there's

821
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:59,429
an opportunities section opportunities

822
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,369
for plant breeders and if you click on

823
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:06,210
that there's a very simple form that

824
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:08,190
requests some information it's not even

825
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,470
you don't have to fill all of it fill

826
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,059
out all of it just your name and tell us

827
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:14,250
what's special about the cultivar and if

828
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,500
you have a CoA you can upload it and we

829
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,539
can start to take a look at it so that's

830
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,849
that's one way for breeders to get in

831
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:24,809
touch and say readers best com yes at

832
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:27,599
readers fest calm and so that's that's a

833
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:31,980
probably a three or four minute forum

834
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,470
it's it's it's meant to be easy and to

835
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,960
not make you wish you haven't ever

836
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:39,449
clicked on it so and then we also have a

837
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,490
name email address invest at breeders

838
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:44,818
best calm for anyone who's interested in

839
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:47,639
talking to us about that and then anyone

840
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:49,239

841
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:52,989

will will be able to hopefully respond

843
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:56,829
to it in a way that's satisfactory so so

844
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:59,139
if you're a breeder you want to go to

845
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:02,079
the online format breeders breast comm

846
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:04,750

849
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:10,719

have another question or you want to get

851
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,709
in contact for some of the other reason

852
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:17,769
there's info at breeders best com

853
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:20,139
all right so all this will be down in

854
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:23,230
the description as well listened with

855
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:26,079
you Ethan so um you know you and I both

856
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:29,170
come from the medical side of cannabis

857
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,840
and and one thing that I've learned from

858
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:36,309
working with breeders with the shape and

859
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:40,840
fire show is that yeah breeders enjoy

860
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:43,989
the botany and the genetics but almost

861
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:47,110
all of them started because they cared

862
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:50,649
about patients would you finish us off

863
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:54,490
by speaking briefly about what you see

864
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:58,900
as the real human potential in this

865
00:37:54,489 --> 00:38:00,699
approach and and and why like you said

866
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,108
you could be doing anything and so why

867
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:04,000
are you putting your heart and a time

868
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:06,639
into this specifically and then wind

869
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,010
with that well this is the antithesis of

870
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:12,639
the traditional approach to making

871
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:15,520
medicine which is you know you identify

872
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:17,889
receptor and computer design a molecule

873
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,409
that'll fit there with the highest

874
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:22,509
potency and affinity and then they find

875
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:25,358
out later it's got disastrous side

876
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:28,420
effects with cannabis we're dealing with

877
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:31,269
a plant that as humans have used for

878
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,570
thousands of years our bodies know how

879
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:37,358
to deal with this plan but heretofore we

880
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,789
him and he had the best ability to get

881
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:43,179
the profiles that would be optimized and

882
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:46,329
so while aspects of the industry have

883
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:48,419
gone for the single molecule and again

884
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:52,000
they're thinking in a one-size-fits-all

885
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,909
cannabis isn't like that here we really

886
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,900
have the opportunity to have

887
00:38:53,909 --> 00:39:00,480
individualized medicine so again

888
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,940
pending on patience profile which would

889
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,369
come from really knowing them their

890
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:09,539
history and their needs we can really

891
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:12,480
suggest a profile that might be better

892
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:14,429
than anything else that they could get

893
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,429
whether it's conventional medicine or

894
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:21,089
just garden-variety cannabis off the

895
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:24,149
shelf in the dispensary I see a future

896
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:28,769
in which we can really get things so

897
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:31,320
that we have a truly great medicine

898
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:34,860
that's going to fit the particular

899
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,289
person's needs hopefully good medicine

900
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:39,900
that's therapeutic that is going to make

901
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:43,650
them feel better and not introduce new

902
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,360
problems so if you are interested in

903
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,039
participating with breeders best and

904
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,110
