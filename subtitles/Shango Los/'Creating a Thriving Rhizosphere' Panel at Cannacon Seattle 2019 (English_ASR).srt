rhizosphere

4
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:21,589

experts as a matter of fact if you dig

21
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,890
the panel today it will be on the Xingu

22
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:02,719

with you and you know you do please take

33
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:31,959
a moment and put it on vibrate so so

34
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:35,349
they don't have to hear it immediately

59
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,569
nutrients and other products over the

60
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,030
past

61
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:38,968
decade 10 is also host of the cannabis

62
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,859
cultivation in soil science podcast so

63
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:43,019
if you're so nerd and haven't checked

64
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:46,109
out taps podcast I highly recommend it

65
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,579
it goes they go deep into vocabulary

66
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:49,099
that loses people which is usually a

67
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,450
good sign

68
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:54,060
alright so so today we're gonna be

69
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:57,268
talking about creating a threads inside

70
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,280
writing rhizosphere and for people who

71
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,859
may be new to soil science that's the

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,539
area that lives all around the root

73
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,709
structure so it's the neighborhood of

74
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,918
the roots so we're gonna be talking

75
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,438
about a life that happens below the soil

76
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,810
near the root so we're gonna start with

77
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:14,818
a question for Colin first and then Jade

78
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,069
and tad will take a turn with the

79
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:20,128
question as well so here we go so Tom

80
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:22,318
for a generation most cannabis growers

81
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:24,479
have simply followed directions on the

82
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,608
back of the bottle nutrients and hoped

83
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,289
everything was okay in the soil now

84
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,510
though we understand that having a

85
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:32,750
thriving rhizosphere is essential to

86
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:35,789
great tasting terpene profiles and

87
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,829
sustainable results for business what

88
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,969
does it mean to you to have a thriving

89
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,680
rhizosphere

90
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,478
and what are some of the outcomes you

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,949
would expect to see in the soil from

92
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,500
your campaign from your cannabis ground

93
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,229
when you actually do create a thriving

94
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,598
Rises here yeah thanks very much Django

95
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,160
and for me this has been a really fun

96
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,709
journey because I approach

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,199
motivation for my academic our

98
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,390
fundamental science background where our

99
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,030
school microbial ecologists and for

100
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,949
years and years I a my studies and my

101
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,020
publications focused on understanding

102
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:10,089
how microbes interacting to the plant

103
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,880
system work plan health plant

104
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,370
development in natural systems and in

105
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,069
agriculture systems and so in thinking

106
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,329
about how to apply microbes or what I

107
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:22,810
think about rhizosphere

108
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:25,629
health in more precision agriculture and

109
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,939
or practices it all relates to the

110
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:32,230
biology the rhizosphere

111
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:34,060
is the root zone and microbes thrive in

112
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,680
the root zone and there's a really

113
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,530
significant interaction that occurs

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,079
where a plant can feed the microbes from

115
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:44,049
the carbon they assimilate through the

116
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:46,629
air and squirt it in as simple sugars to

117
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,240
stimulate the microbial community or

118
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:51,790
rises here microbial community they do

119
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,889
that because they can in exchange when

120
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,530
you get a density and it with the right

121
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,519
diversity of microbes when plants do in

122
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,719
the rhizosphere

123
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,639
they get exchanges with nutrient uptake

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,790
with protecting the rhizosphere from

125
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:11,199
other potential pathogens and what I

126
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:14,310
think would see data-driven when we add

127
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,769
more biology and to what might be

128
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,500
relatively sterile salt environment we

129
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:22,629
see the plants respond by increasing

130
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,189
their yield and increasing their quality

131
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:30,339
and I attribute that mostly to the

132
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:33,100
the increased absorption potential that

133
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:35,109
plants can take nutrients that might not

134
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,900
be available through those microbial

135
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,330
interactions and assert them or allocate

136
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:43,359
them towards more yield important for

137
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:45,669
quality metrics but some nutrients and

138
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,860
micronutrients become a limiting very

139
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,840
quick because absorption capacity within

140
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,889
the writing sphere or substrate times

141
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:56,949
and microbes as they do in nature will

142
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,689
liberate those micronutrients and allow

143
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,439
pets to take them up those

144
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:04,629
micronutrients in particular act as

145
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:07,240
catalysts or as cofactors to allow

146
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:09,699
plants of maximizer physiology which

147
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,090
allows plants to increase yield

148
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:15,579
significantly and quality what we see in

149
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:17,289
our studies and I'll end it there it's

150
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:19,810
when we engaged with commercial farmers

151
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,450
and on our trial farm we have cannabis

152
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,449
and high CBD cannabis farms in Colorado

153
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:27,610
strictly from our any purposes not only

154
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,529
did we see increases in yield but we see

155
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,389
significant increases in different

156
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:34,949
terpene profiles and different

157
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:38,050
cannabinoid profile which which strongly

158
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:41,110
relates to the plant microbe interaction

159
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,270
different microbes will will help plants

160
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,860
in different ways take up those

161
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,680
resources to allocate towards those

162
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,500
qualities right on based on so do what

163
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,959
do you look for to know in your soil or

164
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,199
in your crop that the rhizosphere is

165
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,839
hell yeah

166
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,999
when we first started growing indoors in

167
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,008
early 90s we tried all different methods

168
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:04,349
we grew into positively minor

169
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,479
chronically these soil chemical

170
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:08,668
fertilizers organic fertilizers this is

171
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,620
older than that one it was all tied to

172
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:12,149
things a week and by the end of his

173
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,860
journey and immediately started rolling

174
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:16,348
to my keys and we were doing it in food

175
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,360
in the early 2000 we at some point

176
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:20,759
realized that kind of is grown in soil

177
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,560
the Coles teeth better at that point we

178
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,020
didn't really have the science to tell

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,598
us why but it was some just you know

180
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:31,109
visible through experimentation and so

181
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,870
we started growing exclusively in soil

182
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,370
at that point and and now that all the

183
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,110
scientists coming out we know that there

184
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,088
is this microbial community that it's

185
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,400
making you treats available and letting

186
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:44,699
the plants get optimal health so they do

187
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,870
Express profile which is really

188
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,610
interesting I think people have known

189
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,139
for years the soil in cannabis tasted

190
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,930
better and they just didn't know why and

191
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,389
so now we have the evidence which is

192
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,348
pretty cool and so when we started

193
00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:01,139
growing in the 502 we grew decide to

194
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:05,009
grow outdoors you know living in a

195
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:09,168
living farm in the soil as needed to the

196
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,169
earth and until the edge loop ends

197
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:15,029
they did not miss fertilizers or

198
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,478
pesticides it was just hey a year after

199
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,779
year

200
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,579
sucking the life out of the sandy loam

201
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,079
soil that were blessed with and so by

202
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,449
the time we got it it was a really good

203
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,668
piece of sandy loam but it had been

204
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,139
stripped of a lot of organic matter and

205
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:30,299
I just put the microbial community

206
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,590
that's not so great and so we have been

207
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,099
working over the last five years to

208
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:36,929
rebuild that and so that's been every

209
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,890
year we see an improvement in the soil

210
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,009
and it's been a really interesting

211
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:44,819
journey but um but definitely soil is

212
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:47,189
always it provides the medium for

213
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,470
microbes and then adding things to the

214
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,970
soil so we have had a lot of biochar

215
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,740
which is really important that is

216
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,089
put in a soil and it will be there for a

217
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,769
thousand years or more and I'll be there

218
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,839
forever it's inorganic carbon so it

219
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:01,669
doesn't break down organic carbon does

220
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,050
and provides habitat for all these

221
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:05,360
microbial communities that we're talking

222
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:08,708
up to as far as an actionable item in

223
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,759
building Farm soil biochar is our

224
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,758
absolutely favorite one of our favorites

225
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,350
because touched a lot of things going

226
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,360
back to the condom hit on the living

227
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,800
around nutrient cycling from the

228
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,500
layman's perspective this idea would

229
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,028
work when we're adding organic nutrients

230
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,828
this slow I'm really doing is repeating

231
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:32,778
all these microbial communities to the

232
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:34,008
rise of Spirit events cycling the

233
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:36,620
nutrients are making the plant available

234
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:38,149
so when we had fish meal we're not

235
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,129
directly to feeding the plant that's I

236
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:43,809
think really important but what we're

237
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:46,100
finding even from working with like

238
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:48,438
giant pumpkin growers for instance they

239
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,528
sort of peaked out from a seed to fruit

240
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:53,360
around 1,000 pounds 1,200 pounds which

241
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:55,850
is pretty amazing but since they started

242
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,100
reincorporating back in biological

243
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,860
things like Michael

244
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,960
fungus and various organic amendments

245
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,129
and taking more care with the compost

246
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,590
and looking at the biology they were

247
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:07,419
able to up the hills you know after

248
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,530
group genetics now there have been I

249
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:10,959
think twenty three twenty four hundred

250
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,549
pounds so it's sort of there's

251
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,620
definitely a synergy going on in the

252
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:17,609
rhizosphere that is really important and

253
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,750
then Jay touched on one biochar and as

254
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,970
someone who has worked with some

255
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,649
different biochar producers I just want

256
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,090
to comment that not a lot of charts the

257
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,319
same and it's really important to know

258
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,000
what you're purchasing and what you're

259
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,610
applying because the biochar sort of

260
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,889
this catch-all term but if you get high

261
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,240
quality biochar I would I would say

262
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,009
we're seeing about eight to nine percent

263
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,690
better growth in yield just with the

264
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,389
addition about traffic so it is a

265
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,970
wonderful thing

266
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:47,500
Thank You Ted so first we're gonna start

267
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:50,769
with with Jay and then go to Ted and so

268
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,039
so got respond on a commercial scale

269
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:56,019
producers are working with large volumes

270
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,409
of soil and they often need more

271
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:02,079
scalable solution than we use at home

272
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,679
growers they may be using local soils or

273
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,199
importing soils to

274
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,328
our facts either way these soils may not

275
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:10,878
be in the best condition for growing by

276
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:13,278
the plants what can you suggest for

277
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,740
commercial scale growers to invigorate

278
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,379
and revitalize the soil there and

279
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,789
getting you put to work yeah so and

280
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,920
that's kind of what our situation was so

281
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:24,318
cover rocks are a really great thing and

282
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,669
that is something that you there's all

283
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:27,769
different types of cover crops micro

284
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:29,928
mixing ones are especially beneficial to

285
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,490
reinvigorate the soil and they they put

286
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:33,588
out roots that help the texture of the

287
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,589
soil and break up compact soil they also

288
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,389
fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and

289
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,879
release that into the soil and when they

290
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,678
die they are turned into a additional

291
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,289
organic material and nitrogen of the

292
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:47,509
plants feed off of so a Laurel person

293
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:50,568
that was using cover crops in your Isles

294
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:53,089
and then in between the plantings so

295
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:55,009
offseason led to cover crop and that

296
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:57,080
will keep growing into the spring and

297
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:58,490
then it may or may not move

298
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,250
and whether you're doing a no-till or

299
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,560
until scenario other things that we

300
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,379
really like that are economical at scale

301
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,259
are alfalfa meal that's pretty cheap

302
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:11,028
input material it's got a compounds in

303
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:13,399
it but no microbe is absolutely loved

304
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:15,259
and that's so Mike again it's not very

305
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,778
strong but it adds a lot of organic

306
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:21,620
matter provides great substrate for

307
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:23,750
microbes to feed on world caffeine's

308
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,789
that's another thing that it's a little

309
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,879
bit more difficult it scallops they can

310
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:31,039
be quite expensive but there are some

311
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,110
sources for affordable worm castings

312
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,929
involved and you don't need as much as

313
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,778
you would think so even at relatively

314
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:40,729
low concentrations worm castings provide

315
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:44,360
really great but when the activity

316
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:46,700
organic matter phosphorous all kinds of

317
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,159
nutrients and so that's another one we

318
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,140
love what else

319
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,850
rock dust and that's another chief of

320
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:56,269
method a lot so they're lacking

321
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,129
micronutrient micronutrients so Brock

322
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:01,159
powders and different sources to provide

323
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:03,679
a wide spectrum of base micronutrients

324
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,299
and those need to handle very carefully

325
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,729
they are an inhalation hazard and so

326
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:11,689
when those are being used as a proper

327
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:13,670
precautions need to be taken and mulch

328
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,230
is a really great thing to do and that

329
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,179
can be done with like the cover crops

330
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,090
grow I'm going to use though those down

331
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:21,500
right under the plants so we do not eat

332
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,620
our farm anymore

333
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,059
we pretty much mostly leaves and cut

334
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,009
them down we put a lot of cover crops

335
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:30,799
that's like choose your leaves so we

336
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:33,909
choose alfalfa and vention not

337
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:36,829
affectionate clovers and beneficial

338
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:39,259
insect attractive plants like Calandra

339
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,920
and there's a little bunch of them

340
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:44,330
radishes daikons and so these are grown

341
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,860
around the bounces and they start

342
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,240
getting too big and encroaching on the

343
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,909
plant will mow them down then they

344
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,210
create a mulch way there are plants but

345
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:54,639
that brings down other things

346
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,980
and so thinking you have to keep a bare

347
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,919
soil under your plants or use black

348
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,990
plastic just put that weeds it's kind of

349
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,909
a little bit counterproductive in a lot

350
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:09,639
of ways I'm not a fan of that so yeah

351
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:11,019
they catch a good time that's pretty

352
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,330
answer no but they have a lot to add

353
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:15,159
other than I always suggest that people

354
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,870
if we're talking about their farm which

355
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,360
seems to be the focus of this particular

356
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,278
question then I always suggest get to

357
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,200
know your neighbors find out what cover

358
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,490
crops they're using on their on their

359
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,839
fields because a lot of times they've

360
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,580
done that research for you and they have

361
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,709
that knowledge bringing in an outside

362
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,209
consultant like myself to come in and

363
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:34,449
tell you what cover crop surrenders not

364
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:36,009
always the best idea you know they'll

365
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,600
know about a type of water and how your

366
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,189
water might change over the course of

367
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,110
the season - which is really important

368
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,700
and then also find out what you can

369
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,649
source locally there's so many great

370
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,350
amendments probably in their area I know

371
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:49,990
like Ellen's burgers coming out of a lot

372
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,759
of cow manure available but finding

373
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,799
things that are locally sourced is

374
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,750
really really great option obviously

375
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,490
evaluating the quality of that so we're

376
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,809
casting Spain from Canada are going to

377
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,610
be a very different quality than we're

378
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:01,259
casting stay front of course when you

379
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,740
are

380
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,210
waste or other sources so it's important

381
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,529
to do a little more research on all this

382
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,269
stuff I really know what you're putting

383
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,919
on your soil but there are a lot of good

384
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:12,809
local resources and then the last thing

385
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,539
I'll mention is on our farm which is the

386
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:17,699
vegetable part we use a lot of barbara's

387
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,139
chips to get the free they need place to

388
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,879
dump the chips and when we get to sit to

389
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,830
his chips we take those as we save those

390
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,480
for composting and then all that hard

391
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,040
wood chips that we get in we use for

392
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,170
pathways going to Florida that doesn't

393
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:32,000
great job where these pressure you know

394
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:34,169
we really don't want again

395
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,179
everything's been covered pretty well so

396
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,189
I'm just going to kind of overview my my

397
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:41,699
perspective of this and we're gonna

398
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:44,910
start with the carbon carbon is the

399
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,160
currency of all life on earth and it's

400
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:49,559
the currency what he provides the

401
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:53,879
substrate and the fertility for plants

402
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:57,029
to exist soil is a habitat and it's the

403
00:15:53,879 --> 00:16:00,179
pool of nutrients that plants need to

404
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:03,299
grow the only element that plants get

405
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:06,269
outside the soil is carbon and they fix

406
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:08,609
that from the air from co2 every other

407
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:11,519
nutrient they get from the soil so if

408
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,800
you think about soil as a habitat and a

409
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,350
pool of nutrients that are available for

410
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:18,990
your plants to grow that's the focus and

411
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,500
if you think about carbon as a currency

412
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,720
of all life that is the Pope

413
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,029
since the carbon creates the habitat and

414
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,180
the binding capacity and the motility

415
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:31,909
capacity for your soil to hold nutrients

416
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:34,849
it also creates the habitat for the

417
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:37,519
microbes in that soil to cycle the

418
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,790
nutrients reflecting on what was shared

419
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,850
in these past conversations to deliver

420
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:47,299
those nutrients to your plant and so

421
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,950
scaling carbon as we get to bigger farms

422
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:51,469
is probably the challenge we talked

423
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,060
about mulch we talked about biochar I

424
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,610
want to talk about cover crops and

425
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:57,589
there's there's costs and trade-offs

426
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,399
associated with all those practices I

427
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:03,920
think as farms get larger the cover crop

428
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,359
become much more scalable and what is

429
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,359
the plan at the end of the day we used

430
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,429
to say this in academia from a

431
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,729
microbiology lab plants are charismatic

432
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:15,828
carbon pumps they plant themselves in

433
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,230
the ground they take carbon from the air

434
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:18,680
and they suck it right down under the

435
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,920
soil

436
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,828
so cover crops if you can have seed and

437
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,370
use cover crops effectively you add

438
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:31,430
carbon and habitat into your soils which

439
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:36,319
improves soil fertility in the capacity

440
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:39,460
of nutritional value to be delivered

441
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,460
back up to your place

442
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:43,990
you know one thing I'm gonna - as far as

443
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,910
comic Roscoe is you know if you think

444
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,569
about it what makes one of the things

445
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:53,110
that makes the Amazon so so alive is

446
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:55,240
that the canopy is holding the moisture

447
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:56,859
in and that's what we find from cover

448
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,160
crops - is because you've got this small

449
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:03,308
area below the cover crop where you've

450
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,220
got an Amazonian type canopy and at the

451
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:08,019
top of your soil is kept moist all of

452
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,289
the microbes and worms and all the other

453
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:13,750
light can do their thing closer to the

454
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:15,849
top of the soil where more of the

455
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,279
cannabis roots are located and so

456
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:19,839
another advantage and if we remember the

457
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:21,700
third question when I come back to you

458
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,399
tab because when I heard you answer this

459
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:28,419
question before we usually get your plug

460
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,940
for soil testing and so I would like you

461
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:33,860
to hit on the importance of soil testing

462
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,200
and then GP if you want to add

463
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:42,199
testing that emigrate but but give that

464
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:46,250
one sure so when we talk about any soil

465
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,720
or any nutrient program or any even my

466
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,769
criminal additional we have to look at

467
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,179
this really we have to know what's

468
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,349
arguable soil because what we're trying

469
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,179
to figure out is what the limiting

470
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:54,649
factor encourages and if that's a

471
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,350
nutrient that's something we need to add

472
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,900
but randomly and adding you know a

473
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:01,730
nutrient really doesn't solve the

474
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,140
problem and it can actually compound or

475
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,970
create even more problems down the road

476
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,490
so it's really enough balance and that's

477
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,529
that's sort of my pitch for soil testing

478
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,839
is without and it's just another tool

479
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:13,428
that you can use as gardener just like a

480
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,918
rake or shovel or anything else to

481
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:18,440
really know what's going on and it's

482
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,080
it's really the I think the foundation

483
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,298
that we want to build off of and when we

484
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:24,859
talk about microbial additions what

485
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:26,720
we're doing there is we're essentially

486
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:28,099
unlocking or making those nutrients more

487
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,750
available to plants and you serve about

488
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,889
two aspects you have it the test itself

489
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,298
which is gonna tell you what you need to

490
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,220
add in terms nutrients and then you have

491
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:36,379
the microbes which are going to give you

492
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,130
the ability to siphon those nutrients

493
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:42,040
into a horrible man I think either

494
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:46,270
together

495
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:50,149
yeah so again I think growing or

496
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:51,798
cultivating or farming with David dating

497
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,179
different decisions is critical

498
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:57,579
variability happens Farms cultivation

499
00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:00,310
cannabis barns is alive

500
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:02,740
dynamic systems they're always changing

501
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:05,529
and we have been doing that change with

502
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,650
some form of data and it's critical to

503
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:10,149
start with the baseline of understanding

504
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,519
what we're working with as I mentioned

505
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,790
our substrate in a pot or a substrate as

506
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:18,460
soil in the ground as a as an inherent

507
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:20,529
soil nutrient holding capacity which is

508
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,950
going to change as your plants are

509
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:25,690
taking up nutrients in natural systems

510
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,090
those nutrients are recycled back down

511
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,610
to the ground as to try this one sub

512
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:32,349
plants and the leaves fall and so

513
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:35,919
there's a natural cycle and managed

514
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:38,409
farms and annual managed farms often

515
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:43,750
there's more nutrients leaving the soil

516
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:45,970
then returning and if you know what a

517
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,490
nutrient baseline you have at the

518
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,980
beginning of every season you can be

519
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,589
very efficient and informed with what

520
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,559
you put back in and I think that's a

521
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:58,980
really critical step that general how

522
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,099
the culture ought to say is is missing

523
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,079
significantly

524
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:03,240
there are soil tests it's a common

525
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,089
practice but

526
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,159
I know from years of research and

527
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:10,079
agriculture scientists that more

528
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,000
nutrients are put in than our ever taken

529
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,158
up by plants and in turn build up happen

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,769
and we have pretty good a technological

531
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,809
pollution in waterways and buildup of

532
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:21,869
phosphorus and nitrogen pollution and

533
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:24,480
those excessive chemicals fertilizers

534
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:26,519
that are added in the soil deeply or

535
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,038
decreased microbial biodiversity which

536
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,720
decrease soil functionality and so

537
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,690
balancing out your nutrient inputs

538
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,569
actually nurtures the potential of the

539
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:40,370
like the biology in your soil to persist

540
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:44,639
and by balance out the nutrient cycling

541
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:47,250
potential so your plants can can grow as

542
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,259
naturally as possible and soils without

543
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,528
having to amend a lot we should be

544
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:55,408
responsible and knowing your microbial

545
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:57,690
presence the biodiversity and the sea

546
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:00,270
views or the concentrations along with

547
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,419
those nutrient tests allow you to have a

548
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:05,190
baseline that you can follow over time

549
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:07,950
farming broad scale farming is about

550
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,558
predictable variability so you can be as

551
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,000
consistent as possible if you put a crop

552
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,038
in you want to have a predictable

553
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,558
outcome year after year because you can

554
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,970
manage predictability and so that's what

555
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,859
we're trying to do and he goes all the

556
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,558
way down to understanding the substrates

557
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:25,808
slow changing anything man yeah

558
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,178
that's all good stuff and I can't

559
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:30,099
overemphasize how important soil testing

560
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,559
is we test every year and we've actually

561
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,240
seen organic matter where it go up it

562
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,700
was one percent when we started we're

563
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,950
now at five or six percent and so even

564
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,259
as we use a low till says defeated with

565
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,730
tilling we see an increased and you know

566
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,919
we're putting back a lot of organic

567
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,079
matter that's really important and then

568
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,028
when we add nutrients we we buy only

569
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,538
what would need the order we do the soil

570
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:54,278
test and and so for a micro and macro

571
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:56,859
nutrients and especially micronutrients

572
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:59,648
alliances and whatnot we some years this

573
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:02,019
might need to add dole might other years

574
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:03,788
we may not and actually we don't don't

575
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:05,740
our soil is we don't make we have a lot

576
00:23:03,788 --> 00:23:09,069
of natural light medium in the soil but

577
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,440
different types of lines and and just

578
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:13,269
the the basic amounts of the essential

579
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,129
nutrients you can calculate that and add

580
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:17,679
fixed amounts and do that consistently

581
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:19,418
every year and then under not too much

582
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,909
you're not a ninja little and you're

583
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,880
just right and it's you know adding

584
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:25,130
stuff with

585
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,240
other than science and really important

586
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:32,809
to test your soil retaining isn't fast

587
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,490
so this is a little bit aside but I feel

588
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:37,069
like soil gets a bad rap in a lot of

589
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,079
ways because people whenever they see a

590
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:40,939
deficiency in a plant they just assume

591
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:43,579
it's a nutrient deficiency caused by the

592
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,919
soil and especially for indoor growers

593
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:47,329
you really have to look at reviving the

594
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,429
quality of the lighting intensity

595
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:51,859
lighting your co2 levels your

596
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,870
temperature committee fluctuations your

597
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:57,528
hydrologist later water has a massive

598
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:59,359
impact on nutrient availability so don't

599
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:00,859
just assume that your YouTube deficiency

600
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,689
means you need to have cow man

601
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:04,490
or something else like there's a lot

602
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,259
more to it than that and I don't I would

603
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,700
encourage people to look at the picture

604
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:09,470
holistically I get phone calls from

605
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,509
people Tommy you know they send me a

606
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,250
photo and say fix this and I go hey

607
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:14,990
there's no way I could no one could you

608
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,819
really have to know the whole picture to

609
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,819
really understand what's going on so

610
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:24,609
well don't worry my foot down

611
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:26,169
that's next question and so this is

612
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:27,819
gonna be our third and final question

613
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,519
before we go to your questions

614
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:31,950
so if you if you think you're gonna have

615
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,629
a question that would be the time to

616
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,799
determine what it's going to be so so

617
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,610
this one we're going to start with you

618
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:41,889
tab and then we'll go to

619
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:44,439
Jassa so Ted the cannabis plant

620
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,330
rhizosphere is an ever-changing place

621
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,808
that has an abundance ha's and

622
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:51,669
efficiencies over time other than soil

623
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:53,889
testing which we've already covered for

624
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,470
commercial farmers who need reliable and

625
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,420
consistent results how do suggest the

626
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:01,089
soil being managed over the scope of

627
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:05,289
years to remain potent and abundant and

628
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:07,019
not get depleted season after season you

629
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:09,490
know I really like always answer this

630
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:11,139
realizing that in these commercial

631
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,058
systems every time you harvest a plan

632
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,770
we're pulling out nutrients and we're

633
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:16,420
pulling out organic matter and those

634
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:18,039
things need to be replaced and recycle

635
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,440
and so by getting data points on that

636
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:23,529
through soil testing we were able to

637
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,509
better manage over time our soil

638
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:27,250
fertility by improving ourself agility

639
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:29,289
like Jade's been able to do raising that

640
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,609
organic matter four percent doesn't

641
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,720
sound like a lot but that's a huge

642
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:34,148
improvement

643
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,058
I think every year I'm guessing their

644
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:38,949
inputs are going down because of that so

645
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:41,230
creating not only a better soil

646
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,429
fertility through mineral nutrient

647
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,139
management but also through biological

648
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:45,788
management that's where that organic

649
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:49,658
matter and that harvick creating that

650
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:52,028
habitat is really important yeah that's

651
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:55,629
really well said I think about it same

652
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:59,159
exact way sustainable agriculture is

653
00:25:55,628 --> 00:26:01,778
about giving more than you take away and

654
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,360
moderating your practices that

655
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:06,940
accommodate that is what I would

656
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:09,369
encourage and that's about repeatability

657
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,889
and if you're after year if you have

658
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:13,628
pretty measurable or pretty consistent

659
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:16,329
routines as far as how you're amending

660
00:26:13,628 --> 00:26:18,668
soil and you collect the data on the

661
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:22,329
responses or results of those practices

662
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:25,889
you can slightly alter and tweak the

663
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:29,288
practices to match consistency

664
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:29,949
consistency is key consistent practices

665
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:32,470
equal

666
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:36,548
system results for manageable results

667
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:39,940
that you can alter slightly to keep that

668
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:43,450
trajectory 1% a one-person EcoBoost

669
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:46,990
organic matter of soils is it's

670
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,350
incredible a 5% doesn't happen very

671
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:54,339
often that means that there's a real

672
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:57,638
drive in this form to maximize carbon

673
00:26:54,339 --> 00:27:02,439
content which is a direct correlation

674
00:26:57,638 --> 00:27:04,898
with soil health so that's a nice job

675
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,730
well gee both of them are saying that

676
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:09,158
your numbers are awesome so what

677
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:13,569
encloses out of this question with some

678
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:16,778
with some actionable things that folks

679
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:20,740
to do over the life of their farm to

680
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:22,630
start the bachelors and so we touched on

681
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,799
somebody's already uncover problematic

682
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,480
is

683
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:28,569
and that's probably one of the fastest

684
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,399
ways to put carbon back into the soil

685
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:34,028
years every year you might get one or

686
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:37,000
two cycles of tilling in plant matter

687
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:39,849
that then act to that organic material

688
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,619
level in the soil and so you know I

689
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:44,109
really I really like cover crops pick it

690
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:47,319
up but of any lots of miles and you

691
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:48,849
can't really add too much compost I mean

692
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,609
it's possible but it would be very

693
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:54,009
expensive to do so and so just putting

694
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:56,199
in as much compost as possible alfalfa

695
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:58,569
Hays and mulch with those and those are

696
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,090
pretty cheap and add lots of carbon to

697
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:02,648
the soil and if you on when his dirty

698
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:04,808
your soil well stuff can turn around

699
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:06,819
really quickly like I said our apartment

700
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:09,490
was hey they were tilling it just

701
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:10,990
putting planting hey see the money agro

702
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,659
and just cutting hay cutting hay three

703
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,730
years here is just sucking nutrients and

704
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,679
carbon out of the soil and once we start

705
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,410
putting stuff back and adding compost

706
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,880
and biochar

707
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,650
it just it turned around really quickly

708
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,450
in reversing light I've had one percent

709
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,280
a year increase and it doesn't sound

710
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,350
like a lot but if it is significant and

711
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,058
so we're getting up into those ideal by

712
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:32,089
a percent organic matter levels right

713
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:39,690
now it and hopefully it'll keep growing

714
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:41,699
but we're pretty happy with a rap so

715
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,370
we're going to question it let's do one

716
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,210
quick experiment question because one

717
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,879
thing that I often hear

718
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:50,250
after of awareness are people are I just

719
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,170
can't afford all these amendments or the

720
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:56,609
soil right and then you know

721
00:28:53,170 --> 00:29:00,039
is so hot right now and a lot of the

722
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:02,889
ideas come from using natural materials

723
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,509
found in global area hopefully even

724
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,930
under our farms I'm going to pay for

725
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,690
hell

726
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:12,100
so like you know in 90 seconds or so you

727
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:14,170
each hit that idea of using local inputs

728
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:21,309
or three inputs so that you don't have

729
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:23,170
to work at all started with you ten but

730
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:25,480
you know Canada is really popular

731
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:28,210
together the Korean natural farming I

732
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,650
have not an expert on it but I have

733
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,309
taken quite a few people that have

734
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:35,170
experimented with it I love the idea of

735
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:37,929
sourcing things on your farm as much as

736
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,430
possible I think we do have to look at

737
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,019
the fact that not all nutrients are

738
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,850
found when all harms and where we may

739
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,889
need to bring it in puts but there are

740
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:48,159
things that are there that we can use

741
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,600
and for me Kenneth is very similar to

742
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,550
permaculture which is something a lot

743
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,250
more

744
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:57,359
this idea of just creating sustainable

745
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:59,490
systems or healthy ecosystems and so I I

746
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,369
personally like on our farm for example

747
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:05,370
we we try to recycle so we we look at

748
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:09,389
the best use for every by-product that

749
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:10,829
we have so for example with our with our

750
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,170
leftover vegetables and things that

751
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:14,879
don't get stole if they when they start

752
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,740
to rot those go to the pigs and that pig

753
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,690
manure them to be used to nutrients or

754
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,339
especially our plants down the road so

755
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,830
we're looking at completing the cycle as

756
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:27,599
much as possible with what we have

757
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:29,879
available on the farm yeah I mean look

758
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,919
like amendments year after year that's

759
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,750
quite expensive and it's it's difficult

760
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,900
for people and then you've spent lots of

761
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,720
money buying amendments and so be able

762
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,120
to use little

763
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,409
very appealing and so in our case you

764
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,959
know art they accept that we've done

765
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:47,028
that we've grown cover crops and you

766
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,610
know turn those into compost to fill

767
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:53,659
those in and that has gotten us a lot of

768
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:55,129
a lot of bang for our buck we have you

769
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:57,500
know memorable that are very much I

770
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,380
regret it's just another thing to manage

771
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,778
on a cannabis farm in Washington and

772
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,429
there's so much hassle and regulations

773
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,710
than just adding animals to that future

774
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:09,110
would be unmanageable for us but for

775
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,460
people that can have animals under

776
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:12,829
firmly against the hey exciting friend

777
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,269
to have chickens on their farms and they

778
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,099
go around and they let the chicken into

779
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:17,599
the pot kiln they eat the they make

780
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:19,308
who've been made but fertilizer in the

781
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,109
name of the needs and and so there's

782
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:23,000
there's a lot that you can do with

783
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:25,038
animals they're cheap with chickens so I

784
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,398
would love to do that someday we're not

785
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,148
there yet

786
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:31,209
I think about this is economies of scale

787
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:33,979
and adding carbon back into the systems

788
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,808
revisit this topic and I really think

789
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,819
you can use cover crops with precision

790
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:40,668
and confidence if you can understand

791
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:42,439
and you can see very market results if

792
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:44,330
you had a clover which is a nitrogen

793
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,070
fixer we're not only you adding the

794
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:47,989
carbon in the soil but your attitude in

795
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:49,999
fixing nitrogen in the atmosphere and

796
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,558
bringing that to the soil also in you're

797
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:54,858
gonna see very different results we have

798
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:56,329
too many grass or alfalfa or a clover

799
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:59,118
and if you understand these cover crops

800
00:31:56,329 --> 00:32:01,668
more you can engineer the soil fertility

801
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:04,249
based on your farm there's a lot of

802
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:06,889
physical properties a soil type there's

803
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:08,028
water holding capacity the climate that

804
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:10,189
you're in and so you're gonna have to

805
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:14,210
tailor those practices to your park I

806
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:17,840
would use biochar in my home garden I

807
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,329
can't use it on my 65 acre farm it's not

808
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:24,378
scalable but I can go global on there

809
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:26,628
and so understanding how your video and

810
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:28,848
how your the barn responds what your

811
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:31,189
farm needs you can really clearly

812
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:33,378
identify the stoichiometry or nutrient

813
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,269
ratios nutrient expectations that

814
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:39,798
different cover crops can bring in to

815
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:42,079
supplement the soil health to meet the

816
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:43,210
maximum productivity that you would like

817
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,558
for your Candida

818
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,808
outdoors at the tubulars what we're

819
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,460
talking about Thanks cool thing silent

820
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:49,778
alright so weird open up the question

821
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:54,608
this has got a question to get a starter

822
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:58,028
right so on that cover problem we're an

823
00:32:54,608 --> 00:33:00,398
indoor garden we are soil myths and now

824
00:32:58,028 --> 00:33:01,868
if I was to use cover crops because we

825
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:03,908
have to bend their soil after our soil

826
00:33:01,868 --> 00:33:05,769
test at the time is it going to be

827
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:08,409
harder to amend that soil with the cover

828
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:13,719
crop on there to get it in the soil

829
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:15,759
correctly yes I am going to have a

830
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:18,879
caveat and this is based on some

831
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:21,308
experience not all practices work for

832
00:33:18,878 --> 00:33:23,108
every environment I'm a big fan of cover

833
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:25,028
crops even on an indoor I think that's

834
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:26,798
interesting but there's trade-offs with

835
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:29,588
every decision that we made and I'm

836
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:31,658
going to add that we need to make sure

837
00:33:29,588 --> 00:33:34,808
we can measure that difference on a

838
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:37,330
broad scale if I add clover and grow it

839
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:39,700
over 65 acres I can really measure the

840
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:42,158
difference over a couple of years and

841
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,229
not only the carbon in the soil but

842
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,770
potentially the nitrogen levels as well

843
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:49,350
it's a cycling dynamic process

844
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:51,629
a couple years that's naturally I'm not

845
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:53,609
sure an indoor pot system if it's

846
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,370
measurable in one cycle and you want to

847
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:59,219
have measurable results and I also want

848
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:00,869
to urge caution when you're in play

849
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,400
implementing something like this into

850
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:05,819
your system I think it's a great idea

851
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,369
and I've had growers who tried to

852
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:10,199
implement clover as an example in their

853
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:12,690
indoor grow and it turned out to be a

854
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,668
vector for pests that made it harder for

855
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,530
pest mitigation and so there are

856
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:19,829
trade-offs with every decision we make

857
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:22,260
and your environment might not be as

858
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:23,849
suitable for a cover crop as an outdoor

859
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,399
environment and there's other solutions

860
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:28,199
where we want to nurture the micro they

861
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,789
wanna nurture the carpet building

862
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,339
capacity but maybe in your case and you

863
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:35,070
know you guys use mammoths adding that

864
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,450
life you see good results maybe adding

865
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,269
some more carbon you're gonna see some

866
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:41,128
good results if you add in clover maybe

867
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:42,960
you're going to see good results but the

868
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:44,699
clover is an active vector to bring in

869
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,679
more pests maybe that's not the right

870
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,618
solution as that example so you really

871
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,940
have to work through every scenario to

872
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:54,858
find out what works best for you and

873
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,858
experiment with it thank you

874
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,579
so cabra really good point one thing we

875
00:34:57,588 --> 00:35:01,420
have to remember with an indoor

876
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:03,500
environment is we don't have that same

877
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,780
diversity of beneficial insects

878
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,059
naturally occurring like you would on an

879
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,829
outdoor farm and so I do think cover

880
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:11,239
crops are about more challenging endorse

881
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,720
that's one more crop you do have to

882
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,889
manage fairly stringent that being said

883
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,629
I know people that are doing it

884
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:19,549
successfully either on a commercial

885
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,619
level if you want to check out Joshua

886
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:24,470
Steve's Lenoir freshwater farms that

887
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,240
would be the example I'm closest to but

888
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:27,858
a lot of the guys I work with they're

889
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,479
choosing not to use cover crops for that

890
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:30,909
reason because it is a it is a pest

891
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:36,170
concern than you know just such a

892
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:38,059
concentrated environment as a matter of

893
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,780
fact I just interviewed Joshua steeple

894
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:43,820
and steveland on indoor polyculture on

895
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,900
my last episode at chicken Flair , he

896
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:50,240
goes in-depth on using cover crops and

897
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:52,250
variety of plant species all through but

898
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,479
only in the indoor environment this his

899
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,070
specialty

900
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,740
so we've got time for probably one more

901
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,930
question when we have great I've got

902
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:02,239
three Cowboys they mentioned those but

903
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:04,429
not all biochar is created equal

904
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,259
what would be a preferred type of

905
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:08,419
biochar we've seen a lot more people

906
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,970
cold calling us at the farms

907
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:15,680
representing different types biochar and

908
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:18,649
and obviously I'm concerned anyone

909
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:21,409
I have an opinion and then Tabitha's

910
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:24,740
born expert but in academia we looked at

911
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:27,889
a whole bunch of different biochars and

912
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:31,009
actual the surface area the consistency

913
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:32,629
the variability over time and just like

914
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,090
what we're talking about agriculture

915
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,500
consistent inputs equal consist outputs

916
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,780
a consistent process you get a

917
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,090
consistent process and that yields a

918
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,340
good product and it's consistent you can

919
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:45,170
go on it I think that what we've mined a

920
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,480
lot of the biochar manufacturing

921
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:50,000
facilities are taking and inconsistent

922
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,090
inputs and they're getting inconsistent

923
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,889
outputs and it's all over the place and

924
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:57,620
I'm Steeve my research that we conducted

925
00:36:54,889 --> 00:37:00,529
several years ago and I know that there

926
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:04,179
are facilities manufacturing facilities

927
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:06,560
that that focus on predictable

928
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:08,269
predictable variability there's always

929
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,279
gonna be a little variability and I

930
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:13,550
would I would ask those questions

931
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,500
rigorously and look for the data to make

932
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,590
sure that

933
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,539
produce consistent product over a long

934
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,340
period of time but if within 30

935
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:25,710
different students a hardwoods as you

936
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:28,690
mentioned earlier versus vegetable crops

937
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,610
again is it just consistency or is there

938
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:34,179
one medium that's better than other to

939
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:36,280
have your biochar created from so many

940
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:37,629
different kind I doubt that is there's a

941
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,140
so many different kinds I don't

942
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:44,860
I'm not going to discount the value of

943
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:46,960
biochar it's additional substrate and in

944
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,180
kind of an inert carbon meaning it just

945
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,070
has a lot of surface area and a habitat

946
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:53,469
which will allow the nutrients to bind

947
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:55,990
and microbes to create habitat so you

948
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:58,419
can conceptually get great value from a

949
00:37:55,989 --> 00:38:00,579
lot of different bio power sources but

950
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,340
if it's not consistent for your farm

951
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:04,389
you're gonna have a consistent result

952
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:07,740
inconsistent results and that's the big

953
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:10,179
challenge in my opinion thank you

954
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:12,429
this could be a whole talk

955
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:14,139
and their relationship so I got biochar

956
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:16,989
we're talking about pyrolyze materials

957
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:19,750
so very very high very very low oxygen

958
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:22,750
levels and if you don't do that what you

959
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,820
end up with is charcoal and one of the

960
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:27,190
quick tests that Ranil over a blackout

961
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,160
volatility we've worked with for years I

962
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:31,539
have a good relationship with her they

963
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:33,969
she said the key to take your biochar up

964
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,289
close but it's not it's not high-quality

965
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:38,139
contractors is now

966
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:39,579
absorption rates it's just a quick test

967
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:42,420
but you need to get all these test

968
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:45,099
results and I've heard of companies

969
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,800
anecdotally using all types of materials

970
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:50,019
because wood sourcing is tough with

971
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,080
black owl and uh they're using virgin

972
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:54,519
forest / that sounds horrible I realized

973
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:58,119
but it's actually a really good source

974
00:38:54,519 --> 00:39:01,360
because it needs to be need to be dealt

975
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,609
with or it's a forest fire hazard and by

976
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,120
taking it and making it into biochar

977
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,590
they're able to sequester the carbon and

978
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,059
so there are good sources out there but

979
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,840
you really have to do do due diligence

980
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:15,519
on it and I have seen research that

981
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,289
showed a good biochar be throw meat

982
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,940
eating from chicken manure to woods and

983
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:20,769
all these different sources it's really

984
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:25,269
enough that I consistency of material in

985
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:26,889
the quality of your necklace yeah and

986
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:28,690
just to add to that one that I have seen

987
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:31,359
it is concerning if see people making by

988
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:34,179
up to her out of the lake on waste wood

989
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,829
from what I would and stuff that bad if

990
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:38,019
he says stuff in that that's something

991
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:39,730
you would definitely like stay with you

992
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:42,550
hear anything about using an e-waste

993
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,469
from Germany process would I'm stupid I

994
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,940
offer that that does happen and then the

995
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:47,589
other thing with biochar if you can't

996
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,119
make it yourself and there are all kinds

997
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,850
of instructions on the internet how to

998
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:56,319
build a reactor and it's quite simple it

999
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:58,389
involves a 50 gallon metal drum and and

1000
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,220
you can produce a lot of oil turn away

1001
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:02,230
and the people selling by yourself with

1002
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:05,379
like a thousand dollars are like a tote

1003
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,639
for a 510 pounds of thousands incredibly

1004
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:10,809
expensive this is a buck a pound or

1005
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:12,039
something and so any any biochar even if

1006
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,529
it's not like it'd be making yourself

1007
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:16,300
and it's not like ideal condition

1008
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,800
biochar that's particle size it doesn't

1009
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,720
matter everybody when you're putting

1010
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,400
yeah exactly you're putting carbon into

1011
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,669
your soil of my three and that's a good

1012
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,559
thing

1013
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,659
so I'm if you can figure out how to make

1014
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:27,909
it yourself like that is a really great

1015
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:30,328
way to go the last time I had a

1016
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:37,858
conversation with somebody about

1017
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:39,900
we don't find anywhere - I see the place

1018
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:41,429
that people are selling for it's pretty

1019
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,318
alarming so it's definitely something

1020
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:46,619
you should try to make yourself if you

1021
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:49,650
feel at all crap here people definitely

1022
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:51,160
highly recommend that everyone if you

1023
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:53,200
want to charge it as well

1024
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:55,059
with thinking like a chance - you need

1025
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,399
to and typically just a small amount of

1026
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:59,469
nitrogen is all you need so in Amara

1027
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,840
schools we have it in the rate of 5 to

1028
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:03,579
8% so again not a very high rate that's

1029
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,120
a very aggressive rate for an

1030
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:08,980
agricultural so you get a lot less

1031
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,210
outdoor but a small amount of nitrogen

1032
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,829
is what you would want to get on there

1033
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,449
we so far as efficient either all the

1034
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:15,639
same I can get a rate of like house and

1035
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:17,439
else pretend gallons so not very much

1036
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,730
people can even use compost teas and

1037
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,159
things like that but if you were to have

1038
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,360
it just straight biochar on your soil on

1039
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:24,369
your plant that's actually be more

1040
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,840
efficient than you're planning on basis

1041
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:27,819
of taking up nitrogen so you can see

1042
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,710
your plant yellow and efficiency just be

1043
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:33,180
careful that were in charge

1044
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:36,690
yeah it'll suck them to create also

1045
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:38,068
and for a decision right now fantastic

1046
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,710
well thank you all for being here for

1047
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:48,829
the

1048
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:48,829
[Applause]

1049
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,320
you
