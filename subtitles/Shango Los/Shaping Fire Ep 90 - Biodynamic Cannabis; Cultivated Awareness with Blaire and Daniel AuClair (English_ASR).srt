we all love our plants and our cannabis

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,199
plants play an important role in our

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,519
lives

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,678
when we as humans love something give it

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,480
importance and strive to understand it

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,839
we call that sacred

cannabis and food at radical herbs farm

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,239
in kovalev california i'll point out

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,799
that radical is spelled radical like the

38
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,438

r-a-d-i-c-l-e

40
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,919
blair trained on biodynamic farms first

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,079
on maui and then at rafael gardens in

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,478
sacramento located at what was then

43
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,158
rudolf steiner college daniel also

44
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,239
started farming in hawaii before

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
starting an apprenticeship at live power

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,478
community farm a horse-powered

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
biodynamic vegetable csa located in

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,200
kovalev

49
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,199
their paths came together when they met

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
at the farmers market in kovalev and

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,320
from there they embarked on an

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,960
agricultural endeavor together getting

53
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,879
married and starting a family in fact

54
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,959
blair is expected to go into labor any

55
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,959
day now which explains why she sounds a

56
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,118
little out of breath in the interview

57
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,879
they are now stewards for 60 acres

58
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,959
consisting of hay fields and about two

59
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,560
acres under cultivation of vegetables

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,559
and cannabis production

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,640
in 2018 they won the regenerative farm

62
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
award at the emerald cup with two other

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
farms

64
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,839
radical herbs is both dragonfly earth

65
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,919
medicine and sun and earth certified

66
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,000
blair and daniel practice biodynamics on

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
their farm radical herbs and this year

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,439
will be featured in a documentary

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,159
alongside green source gardens and bryce

70
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,919
land forest farm the film titled tending

71
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,598
the garden is a journey through a year

72
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,679
in the life of these three family farms

73
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,079
cultivating cannabis food and community

74
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
in the pursuit of a regenerative future

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,760
blair and daniel practice a sort of

76
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,239
farming that embraces both science and

77
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,759
mysticism today we are going to discuss

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,200
biodynamics

79
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,359
special note that the internet isn't

80
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,759
very robust out in kovalev there are a

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
few minor audio drops in today's show

82
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,518
welcome to the show blair welcome to the

83
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
show daniel hey right on shanghai thank

84
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
you for having us thanks so much for

85
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,039
having us happy to be here right on so

86
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
so let's start by creating a bit of

87
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,759
context for folk because i bet there's a

88
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,919
bunch of folks like me who generally

89
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,878
think that like biodynamic growing is

90
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,119
essentially like organic growing plus

91
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,518
magic and like you know that's a little

92
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
vague but it's also not that far off

93
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
from what i'm gathering so so please

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,239
like like set the table for our

95
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:12,079
discussion today by walking us through

96
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,158
the philosophy behind biodynamics and a

97
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
bit about rudolph steiner the father of

98
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,840
the practice

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,319
sure so um that's a really great

100
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,360
description of it and um

101
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,039
steiner was known uh as the scientist of

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,400
the invisible

103
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,919
and so

104
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,400
he had been working his whole life

105
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
to establish a a

106
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,719
science that would be taken as

107
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,759
legitimately as the natural sciences

108
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,598
but one that studied spiritual phenomena

109
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,840
as opposed to

110
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:46,000
or or as it relates to

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
the natural sciences he wanted there to

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,639
be a science of the spirit to go

113
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,400
alongside the science of matter the

114
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,518
natural sciences

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,920
and he devoted his life to that he was a

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,438
part of the theosophical society back in

117
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,639
the day with h.p blavatsky

118
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:08,079
he wrote books he lectured extensively

119
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,639
he established

120
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,959
areas of research that changed medicine

121
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:17,439
pedagogy economics architecture the arts

122
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,399
he had his hands in everything

123
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,319
uh and was a very controversial figure

124
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,159
actually um

125
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,639
and in his time

126
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:33,600
um but before he left us he

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:36,960
was asked by farmers uh in austria to

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,720
give indications for a spiritual renewal

129
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,039
of agriculture and that's actually what

130
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,320
the ag lectures were originally titled

131
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,479
it's the spiritual renewal of

132
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,439
agriculture because these farmers a lot

133
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,439
of them

134
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,719
the lectures were given on a sugar beet

135
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,399
estate

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,639
they were noticing

137
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,519
uh with the onset of chemical

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,240
agriculture they were seeing a decline

139
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,038
in soil health a decline in seed

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,199
germination and they really were

141
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,519
concerned about this and wanted to know

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,879
what they could do to combat that and so

143
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:13,359
he gave a series of lectures uh to that

144
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,879
end and that's where biodynamics has

145
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,919
come from

146
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,439
and

147
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,959
um

148
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,600
there was an experimental circle that

149
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,879
was formed very soon after and that's

150
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
what we

151
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:27,600
have been working with today there's a

152
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,959
series of preparations that are were

153
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,520
given to

154
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,120
um using the compost pile there's field

155
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,599
sprays

156
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,038
and just ideas of working with the

157
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,720
rhythms of

158
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,879
moon cycles

159
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
and

160
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,719
what could blair say

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
uh yeah i think that's a really good

162
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,919
like beginning introduction and that was

163
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,960
those lectures were given in in 1924

164
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,879
and so this was kind of some people see

165
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,318
it as like sort of the first

166
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,839
uh kind of

167
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,160
written organic guidelines in a way uh

168
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,439
predating sort of what we know but we do

169
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,120
know that two

170
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,800
uh you know

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,280
hundreds and centuries before that

172
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,960
people have been practicing agriculture

173
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,439
and been doing regenerative practices um

174
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,318
it and it was just sort of in this time

175
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,879
that

176
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
uh chemical agriculture started to make

177
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,839
its way in that there was really

178
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,758
beginning to see a degradation in land

179
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,198
um but one of the things that steiner

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,520
really looked at

181
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,400
in looking at a farm was looking at it

182
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,038
as sort of this this living organism

183
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,719
that strives to be self-sustaining

184
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,159
and so when you're looking at that

185
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
you're looking at

186
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,560
you know one of the biggest things is

187
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,239
how do we reduce the off-farm inputs

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
that we're bringing on

189
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
into the farm and how do we create

190
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,400
fertility on the farm and how do we

191
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,800
create this organism that can function

192
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,679
and be able to sustain itself without

193
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,759
having to bring a lot in

194
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,959
and so you know we're looking at not

195
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,280
only like

196
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,279
growing cannabis growing vegetables but

197
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,638
how do we incorporate

198
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,079
different parts into the farm as far as

199
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,199
like

200
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,478
bringing the animal elements in you know

201
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,879
we have we have different types of

202
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,800
livestock but a way that you can bring

203
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,439
the animal element into the farm if

204
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,639
you're just even in a backyard gardener

205
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:27,839
is to plant some flowers um to grow some

206
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,400
perennials uh grow some annuals and in

207
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,918
that way you're bringing in you know

208
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,239
you're bringing in bees you're bringing

209
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,758
in pollinators those bring in birds and

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,680
all of a sudden you have this uh

211
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,038
vibrant thriving

212
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,720
animal aspect to the farm

213
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:49,759
also um part of bringing in biodiversity

214
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,000
and creating a living organism is

215
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,360
building fertility and there's different

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,319
ways of doing that we build fertility by

217
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,879
um you know making making compost and we

218
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,759
definitely still are

219
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,080
lacking in our closed loop system and

220
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,439
still bringing compost bringing potting

221
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,680
soil but it's always sort of like a

222
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,879
it's a constant goal that we're striving

223
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,000
to get better at as is is closing those

224
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,240
loops and you don't always have to it's

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,279
not always about having that

226
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,478
animal aspect of making compost and

227
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:29,519
for fertility cover crops are like an

228
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,360
amazing excellent way to bring in

229
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,679
fertility to the farm

230
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,000
a great way to keep your soil covered in

231
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,759
the winter time and kind of closing the

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,799
loop in that respect and also

233
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,599
it just

234
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,559
it

235
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,959
it's a great way to also just bring in

236
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,119
more plant diversity to your farms

237
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,439
you're not only just growing like in a

238
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,278
cannabis bed if you're you know

239
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,279
has a tendency to just they you know

240
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,679
people will grow cannabis and then in

241
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,679
the winter time it'll just

242
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,838
sit there um but if you're bringing a

243
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,599
cover crop in and planting that on your

244
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,320
cannabis beds

245
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,278
then you're bringing in more diversity

246
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
and

247
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,519
soil

248
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,759
different soil roots and stuff too

249
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,560
to that farm

250
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,919
also as far as diversity like wild

251
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:23,439
places are really important too

252
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,838
in creating this farm organism in that

253
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,640
even in the demeter certification you're

254
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,839
required to have 10 of your farm at

255
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,919
least dedicated to wild areas

256
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,360
and we know in those kinds of areas

257
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,278
you're you're

258
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,919
bringing in a whole

259
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,759
dynamic array of different animals and

260
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,000
organisms and

261
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,439
i think the way that we try to

262
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,559
treat our farm in even the places that

263
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,040
we cultivate we're trying to mimic wild

264
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,439
places as much as possible by

265
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,199
having as much diversity of crops you

266
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,959
know making sure we have flowering

267
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,320
plants and

268
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,479
annuals

269
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,240
annuals for flowers and perennials for

270
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,360
flowers and ensuring that there's sort

271
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,000
of this

272
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,720
constant uh

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,679
amount of vegetative growth all the time

274
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,000
to encourage a diversity of

275
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,000
beneficial insects and pollinators and

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
birds and putting bird houses up and

277
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,559
that sort of thing

278
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,200
and then

279
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,679
let's see as far as uh

280
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,399
the biodynamic preparations daniel

281
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,879
touched on a little bit

282
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
and it will go into more detail later in

283
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,720
the show

284
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,959
um

285
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,759
it's kind of one of the more well-known

286
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:43,518
parts of biodynamics is the biodynamic

287
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:45,039
preparation the horn manure and it does

288
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,919
one a little bit less known its

289
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,439
counterpart is horn silica and those two

290
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,000
work together

291
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,720
in sort of relation to the cycle of the

292
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,519
year whereas like horn manure is made

293
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,639
from

294
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,919
uh putting a manure and a cow horn

295
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,879
buried in the winter months and that's

296
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,599
sprayed

297
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,360
on the soil or as horn silica

298
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,200
is also put in the

299
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,680
in a horn but buried in the summer time

300
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,440
and used as a foliar spray as the plants

301
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,120
are ripening and kind of trying to

302
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,839
enforce the

303
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,078
amplify the cosmic forces that are

304
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,880
influencing the plants

305
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:26,479
and so um in a lot of biodynamics you're

306
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:29,600
kind of looking at that duality of

307
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,839
aspects not only in the type of

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,320
fertilization that we're doing as far as

309
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,959
like the horn manure and the horn silica

310
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,480
but looking at the rhythm rhythms of the

311
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,000
year

312
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,278
how the plants and the earth are

313
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,200
affected by those rhythms and then also

314
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,519
kind of like the the

315
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
the cosmic aspects

316
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,519
of

317
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,720
of the earth and and the influences of

318
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,360
the cosmos on the earth and the plants

319
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,680
and so the the plants are really you

320
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,278
know creatures that are

321
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,000
much more

322
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,200
influenced by the cosmos than than we

323
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,399
are

324
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,440
and so

325
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,278
there uh there's a whole um planting

326
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,079
calendar that people are familiar with

327
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,639
that we'll kind of go into a bit later

328
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,439
in more detail

329
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,240
but the you know the

330
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,120
plants are very influenced by

331
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,278
mainly by the moon and well mainly by

332
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,320
the sun first and then by the moon and

333
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,600
then there's

334
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,480
constellations and

335
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,200
uh planets and all those things

336
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,200
uh too

337
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,839
um

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,879
let's see and then there's also there's

339
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,519
the biodynamic compost preps and so

340
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,679
the compost preps are

341
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,600
sort of um

342
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,958
were indications that were given by

343
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,759
steiner in his lectures and they really

344
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,838
look at kind of they're

345
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:03,278
really seen as sort of like homeopathic

346
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,399
preparations that are used to bring a

347
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,200
heightened vitality to the compost pile

348
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,839
and

349
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:15,278
those are created and made in order to

350
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,720
bring different elements and to really

351
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:21,838
create a potentized compost that then

352
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,240
can be used on on the land one of the

353
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,200
things that i noticed right away is that

354
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,680
this really does sound like um

355
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,399
like more of a family farm environment

356
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,719
right where where people are going to

357
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,200
i don't know grow humans along the

358
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,839
alongside growing their crops like when

359
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,680
when you're describing like you know 10

360
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:47,040
of a wild zone and lots of these flowers

361
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,359
and you know um you know uh piles of

362
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:53,240
sticks for birds to live in and hedge

363
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:57,440
rows and like it sounds like a very um

364
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:00,159
biologically complex and abundant area

365
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,680
um which which is what i picture when i

366
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:06,000
visit regenerative farms

367
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,278
you know in northern california

368
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,240
whereas

369
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,639
i don't picture this when i when i see

370
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,519
some of the multi-acreage farms that are

371
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,120
very

372
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,278
i don't know more sterile right they've

373
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,879
got very long rows and you can see the

374
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,919
high fences

375
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,480
um for protection and and you can see

376
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,198
the the the heavier tilling equipment

377
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,560
and

378
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,479
um it's

379
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,198
like like that seems like it would be

380
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,920
the antithesis of what you are

381
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:38,399
describing which is kind of like

382
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:41,278
building an agricultural area or a homes

383
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,399
home place on the farm where you can

384
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,399
grow

385
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,879
flowers and food

386
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:53,600
and humans and animals and cannabis

387
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:56,480
and um it just seems a lot more like a a

388
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,800
traditional abundant environment instead

389
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,039
of more of a mechanized

390
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:04,078
sterile growing environment yeah

391
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:07,679
definitely and i would say you know like

392
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:10,319
as looking at growing cannabis too that

393
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,078
you know and and plants in general

394
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,920
they're there absorbing their

395
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,638
environment they can't go to other

396
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,719
places to get things and so you know

397
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,399
looking at like what's the type of

398
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,560
cannabis you want to smoke what's the

399
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,839
kind of food you want to eat

400
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,159
where that

401
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
plant being is located and what it's

402
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,039
absorbing

403
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,680
has a lot of influence on that and so

404
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,719
are you getting something that's

405
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,120
absorbing salt fertilizers and that's

406
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,079
what you're smoking or are you having

407
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,399
something that's growing in in living

408
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,559
soil surrounded by other plants and the

409
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,039
communication of other plants under the

410
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,958
soil and the mycelium and that's what

411
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,559
the plant is absorbing and that's what

412
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,638
you're ingesting and and experiencing

413
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,278
and so i think that that was like a

414
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,079
really nice a really beautiful picture

415
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:05,278
um that you painted and i think so much

416
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:07,120
why we love living where we live and the

417
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,439
communities that we live in and the

418
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,519
other farmers that we're surrounded by

419
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,399
is really you know

420
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,799
i think

421
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,720
you know not just the community that

422
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,278
we're able to create on the farm with

423
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,120
diversity but also you know so important

424
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,078
to have a

425
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
community in general with with who we're

426
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,078
uh

427
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,799
relating with and and who were you know

428
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,159
in this whole process with too listening

429
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:36,078
to you and daniel describe the um you

430
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,759
know the the uh

431
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:42,078
embracing of nature and the the coaxing

432
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,240
the most out of nature inviting it to

433
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,638
participate with you on your farm

434
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
um it actually sounds a lot like the

435
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,720
messages that we're all sharing now in

436
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,680
the regenerative cannabis

437
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,000
scene

438
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,198
but um it's interesting to note that

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,320
that this

440
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,559
agriculture and life philosophy you know

441
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,399
came from the 1920s where they were

442
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,918
about to

443
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,798
run into agriculture like industrial

444
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,439
agriculture and petroleum fertilizers

445
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,798
and

446
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,640
and you know the mechanization of of the

447
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,599
um of the farm

448
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,400
and and these folks were having an early

449
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,519
reaction

450
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,038
to being very unsure and unsettled about

451
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,119
that just like we are feeling you know

452
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,798
we've got evidence now why

453
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,639
they were right to be unsure and

454
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,200
unsettled because now we're at the we're

455
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,240
at the far side of industrialized

456
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,558
farming feeling like okay we've seen

457
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,240
enough and we need to we need to circle

458
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,160
back to some of the important aspects um

459
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,519
that that we've lost

460
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,519
um does that is like does that fit in

461
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,038
for you with your picture because i i

462
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,798
think that there's something more to it

463
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,558
like obviously there's the preps that

464
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,519
we're gonna talk about in set two or

465
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,599
three

466
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:01,679
but um but i really feel like um

467
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,119
i mean not not to sound too woo but it

468
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,880
actually sounds like you're you're

469
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:08,798
farming and the ways that you go about

470
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,440
it are kind of as much of um ritual and

471
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,519
prayer as it is

472
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,279
you know just trying to grow good crops

473
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,798
yeah i would say you know i think what

474
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:21,759
modern agriculture has done is

475
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:25,119
taken things apart and separated and

476
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:28,640
tried to create and compartmentalize

477
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:31,599
things and that's not what nature does

478
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,160
you know nature works in in rhythms and

479
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:37,038
cycles and like you know taking the

480
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,640
animal away from the grass and then

481
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,640
growing the feed over here and then all

482
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,480
of a sudden you're having this complete

483
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,120
imbalance where you're having to put

484
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,960
these chemical fertilizers on

485
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,119
on a field to grow something and then

486
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,759
you have this over abundance of

487
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,599
of waste from the animals and it's just

488
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,240
like completely out of balance where

489
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,119
we're trying to bring as many things

490
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,160
together in one place to have them

491
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,798
benefit each other and and work together

492
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,558
and then i think where biodynamics takes

493
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:12,639
it another step

494
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:15,759
is trying to create ways to

495
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,400
create pictures and imaginations for

496
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,679
things that we can't necessarily see

497
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
or that

498
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,000
regular science can't um

499
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,960
be able to quantitatively measure and in

500
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,679
that respect steiner really was able to

501
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,798
create some pictures and imaginations

502
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,120
for

503
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,839
a whole level of

504
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,678
spiritual

505
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,839
elemental um things that happen on the

506
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,038
farm and in nature

507
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,319
that we can maybe intuitively feel

508
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,879
or

509
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:53,759
try to imagine and so in and that way he

510
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,760
kind of like took agriculture

511
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,640
um

512
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:02,400
to a different to a different level of

513
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:06,320
you know how are the planets influencing

514
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,640
the plants um how are the elemental

515
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:12,480
beings working like

516
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,640
what are the gnomes and doing to

517
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,079
doing on the land and different things

518
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,480
like that where we can really um

519
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,000
not even i feel like in a certain sense

520
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,159
begin to

521
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,960
imagine the different

522
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,200
microscopic spiritual things that are

523
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,960
happening in the plant world in the

524
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,679
natural world

525
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,120
and just try to begin to

526
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,440
imagine

527
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,678
how all those things are happening like

528
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,840
like uh daniel was saying only recently

529
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,798
we've been able to

530
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,678
um

531
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,918
talk

532
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,240
at some point saying only recently being

533
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,840
able to understand what mycelium is

534
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,400
doing and how that's able to

535
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,240
create a communication with with plants

536
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,200
and i think that's one thing we try to

537
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,919
do in our cannabis beds too and why we

538
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
do so much companion plantings i think

539
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,919
really that there's this whole

540
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,960
conversation happening underground

541
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,919
between

542
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,200
the roots that is really important to

543
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,080
have as much diversity as possible

544
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,000
and

545
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,639
i don't personally know that and i think

546
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,798
that scientists are just being able to

547
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080
somehow with their measurements like be

548
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,918
able to

549
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,038
have an idea that there is something

550
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,280
going on

551
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,839
but i think that like also

552
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,720
back in the day

553
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:35,359
in 1924 steiner was able to understand

554
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,759
that there is this and uh elaborate

555
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,719
communication happening with with plants

556
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,119
that we

557
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,159
um you know can't really grasp but

558
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,558
weren't able to grasp at that time

559
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,600
there's an image that he shares of the

560
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:48,399
farm

561
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,240
uh

562
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,880
being an image of a human standing on

563
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,440
its head right where

564
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,360
the the nerve sense and the

565
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,880
the thoughts of the plants are happening

566
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,599
under the ground

567
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,600
and then above ground is the belly and

568
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,839
the reproductive organs so there's like

569
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,918
an inversion so

570
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,639
to make sure that the

571
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,880
the nerve sense in the soil is active

572
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
and alive is allowing for

573
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
more um

574
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,798
communication to be happening through

575
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,319
the plants and it's a very fun image to

576
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,279
work with as you're walking around the

577
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,960
belly

578
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:27,519
of the farm and the soil being the

579
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,880
diaphragm separating the two

580
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,480
you were making me think of uh um

581
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,880
of a thing where

582
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,279
we want it science wants us to have way

583
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,440
measure and count to be able to tell if

584
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,440
something exists and it's real whereas

585
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,558
anthroposophy and biodynamics wants to

586
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,080
replace weigh measure and count with

587
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:50,079
levity rhythm and quality oh man that

588
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,319
that's heavy duty actually because and

589
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,678
actually to to the i was like sitting

590
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,558
here struggling right because i'm like

591
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,000
okay

592
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:01,200
so is by dot is biodynamics more

593
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,400
um you know a strategy for

594
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,400
for farm upkeep or is it a

595
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
philosophy of living

596
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,880
and i and i realized that

597
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,640
it's kind of it's kind of both those

598
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,919
plus because

599
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,400
so many of us me included um you know

600
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,440
we're feeling more disconnected from our

601
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
communities and from um you know nature

602
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,320
and from

603
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,159
uh you know our families everybody's so

604
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,158
spread out and especially during these

605
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,520
quarantine days it's harder to see each

606
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,640
other and everything

607
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,119
and and this entire

608
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,480
way of thinking about agriculture

609
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,199
continually comes back to

610
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,360
interconnectedness

611
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,919
and um

612
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,798
you know kind of like a um

613
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,559
a spiritual intent like like i'm i'm

614
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,079
going to do my i'm going to do these

615
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:51,678
things on the farm that i know that are

616
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,678
good for the farm because in the end i

617
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,720
need to produce food in cannabis so that

618
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,038
i can you know feed my family but at the

619
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,839
same time i'm going to do it with a

620
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,158
ritualistic intention that somehow makes

621
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,918
it more meaningful it's like it's like

622
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,200
taking regular

623
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,159
regener regenerative or natural farming

624
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,400
and and turning it way up

625
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,919
with um with ritual practices to give it

626
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,360
spiritual meaning do you think do you

627
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,559
think that's a fair assessment i mean

628
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,319
i'm new to this so i don't know what i'm

629
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,558
talking about but but you hear listening

630
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,319
to you talk about it it makes me feel

631
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:29,599
like it's it's all of our bases of

632
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:32,480
natural farming turned up

633
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,199
with spiritual practices i think you hit

634
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,079
the nail right on the head that's like a

635
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,159
perfect summary and um steiner even has

636
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,879
you know also like a lecture on

637
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,600
festivals like he knew that like this

638
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,760
community sort of festival spirit

639
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:51,519
celebration

640
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:56,000
is also extremely important

641
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:59,759
for us i think for nature for the world

642
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,759
and being able to you know it's not it's

643
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,000
not just about

644
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,759
making money on the farm it's so much

645
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,519
more than that and how can we connect

646
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:12,319
with with different parts of of of being

647
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,319
and be more

648
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,159
spiritual creatures there's an element

649
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,639
like a trend to want to say that nature

650
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,960
will be fine if we just leave it alone

651
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,919
like humans need to remove themselves

652
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,360
from the equation but anthroposophy is

653
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,200
kind of

654
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,319
a way of balancing that out to say like

655
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,240
you cannot remove the human element from

656
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,038
from nature we are

657
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,038
a part of it and he goes on to say that

658
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,119
like in the future

659
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,519
the seasons will

660
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,359
will happen less and less unless until

661
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,558
humans recognize their role in it like

662
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,959
we need to be a part and

663
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,599
be co-creators with

664
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,400
nature because nature needs us as much

665
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,839
as we need it and

666
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,559
that puts us in a very delicate place of

667
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:05,918
what is our motive

668
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,759
is it ego driven to dominate or are we

669
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,200
wanting to

670
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:14,240
be fair and equitable and and um with

671
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,558
each other and to you know it's a

672
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,640
there's a moral element that comes that

673
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:22,399
comes out of this too it really

674
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,559
illustrates how this variety of farming

675
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,720
and i dare say the two of you then as

676
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,278
practitioners of this type of farming

677
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,960
you really have to

678
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,720
you really have to lead with your heart

679
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,200
and with vulnerability right because

680
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,278
because i can imagine even though you

681
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,640
get great results on your farm and even

682
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:40,319
though the preparations that we're going

683
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,120
to talk about in the next two sets are

684
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,319
very real and they're about managing

685
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:48,798
nutrients and such um i can imagine that

686
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,839
a lot of this really strikes people as

687
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,319
woo

688
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,399
and you have to be a little choosy about

689
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,960
who you're gonna be vulnerable with

690
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,798
about like how you actually see your

691
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,679
your farm because you've you've really

692
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,720
described um you know

693
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,038
um

694
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,038
you use this term imaginations right and

695
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,278
i'm sure that that's like a term of art

696
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,079
from rudolph steiner but but the way

697
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,480
that i take it myself is like you are

698
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,558
you are intentionally using your mind

699
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,159
and your heart and storytelling and

700
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,398
imagining and

701
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,080
daydreaming and all of this stuff to

702
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,439
connect you with the animals and the

703
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,639
foods and the

704
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,159
and the natures of your farm and

705
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,399
you know that

706
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,240
that's not this it's not entirely

707
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,199
popular right now right where everyone's

708
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,798
trying to sterilize everything and get

709
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,480
everything down to

710
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,038
that that great quote that daniel just

711
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,038
said about like weights and measures and

712
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,960
and scales right

713
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,038
where everybody is approaching not

714
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,200
everybody i don't want to be unfair so

715
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,519
much of farming is about bean counting

716
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,558
now and it's spreadsheet farming

717
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:57,278
where where your kind of farming may you

718
00:27:54,558 --> 00:28:00,158
know still gets the the bountiful

719
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:04,079
results but somehow it has more

720
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,559
um more human meaning

721
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,879
and daydreaming in it and that's that's

722
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,359
a pretty that's some radical stuff it

723
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,600
feels vitadymix feels so good because it

724
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,839
is so unintellectual

725
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,079
right like there's a very like science

726
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,879
is like dominating our culture right now

727
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:24,079
with this intellectuality biodynamics is

728
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,679
dirty it's unacademic i feel and you're

729
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,359
right the uh when we say the

730
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,000
imaginations um

731
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,319
steiner had the three

732
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,480
capital letter eyes imagination

733
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,678
intuition and inspiration

734
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,919
are

735
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,000
our three components to

736
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,480
developing oneself i think bob marley

737
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,440
was tuned into it also he had the i3s

738
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,599
were his backup singers but um

739
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,600
it's yeah it's very much um

740
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:54,240
i love i've

741
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,919
i went got into the weeds there it is

742
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,000
um very much

743
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,000
unintellectual and um

744
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,480
i think it just like creating a mat like

745
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:07,759
we talk about creating imaginations it's

746
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,480
like a steiner did give like quite

747
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:13,759
specific indications of types of

748
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,440
meditations to do and actually at night

749
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:20,480
um kind of as uh sort of a meditate

750
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,558
imagination and meditation

751
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,480
to go through your look at your day

752
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,440
going backwards

753
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,200
um

754
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,120
like start just

755
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,840
laying in bed you just start to think

756
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,639
about like what you did that day and

757
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,798
step by step go backwards and then kind

758
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,159
of bring it forwards and you take that

759
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:42,079
into your into your dream world and to

760
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,200
steiner too the dream world is also a

761
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:47,359
very important place where we're able to

762
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,240
communicate

763
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,119
with

764
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,278
spiritual beings and

765
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,599
the cosmos in a way that we can't

766
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,919
necessarily do during the day it

767
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,839
sometimes seems like there is a turn off

768
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,159
with biodynamics because there's a new

769
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,038
language that needs to be learned like

770
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,880
etheric bodies and astral bodies and

771
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,558
living warmth and

772
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,080
dead warmth and

773
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,918
all these kind of things but i would

774
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,439
just push back against that and say that

775
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,200
the language that we're using is one

776
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,519
that we had to learn at the beginning

777
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,000
also and so when

778
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,158
you take the time to to

779
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,880
to get into why these words were chosen

780
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,278
and and what not like it it does

781
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,799
bring a living quality to

782
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,000
farming that

783
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,879
for us i guess is um continually

784
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,759
inspiring and allow puts us in a place

785
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,880
of curiosity

786
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,879
um and always

787
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:46,398
it it makes us take the broadest

788
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,918
view of what's happening as opposed to

789
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,678
focusing on

790
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,840
what's directly in f we have to see

791
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,519
what's directly in front of us but then

792
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,119
use

793
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,960
as much of our

794
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,398
surroundings and open

795
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,120
open one's perspective or um

796
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,239
perspective to to gain clarity as to

797
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,239
like what's happening because everything

798
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,480
is connected and so

799
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,240
biodynamics for us

800
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,200
is a

801
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,319
really broad and it's a very broad

802
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,278
way of

803
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,720
uh

804
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,720
seeing the world

805
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,880
right on i really get that idea of the

806
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,880
inspiring hearing your describe it you

807
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,960
know my my head goes two places with it

808
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,519
the farm that as you describe it it

809
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,759
sounds like like a like a beautiful

810
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,960
beautiful place that is that is rich

811
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:35,119
with smells and animals and and like a

812
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,679
very highly expressive

813
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,759
um soil food web right and it just it

814
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,320
just it sounds beautiful it sounds like

815
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,558
a beautiful like hobbiton kind of place

816
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,119
to go and it sounds like a great place

817
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,678
and yet the other side of me is is all

818
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,918
like oh it also sounds very inefficient

819
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,320
and like that is your whole damn point

820
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,278
right is that those efficiencies

821
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,558
is what kills human connection and you

822
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,359
are intentionally reaching out to these

823
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:03,278
imaginations

824
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,119
and um

825
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,558
and intent when you're making these

826
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,599
preparations

827
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:11,519
so that it builds connections because

828
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,079
like that's that's kind of at the core

829
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,399
of the whole biodynamic thing right is

830
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,879
these connections yeah i mean i mean in

831
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,879
many ways i would say that we're all i

832
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,679
i wouldn't categorize as us as

833
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,679
inefficient too i mean as we talk about

834
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,640
biodynamics and kind of you know talk

835
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,600
about why we're into it so much we also

836
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,519
like utilize a lot of different other

837
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:38,959
agricultural practices too and don't see

838
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,720
biodynamics as like the only way like um

839
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,880
you know as far as our vegetable farming

840
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,839
we're really into

841
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,120
um

842
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,240
no-till

843
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:50,798
uh bio-intensive market gardening which

844
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,399
is really like an amazing practice and

845
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:56,798
like all really focused on efficiency

846
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:59,439
and you know trying to grow vegetables

847
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:02,158
with the least amount of

848
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,399
uh disturbance to the soil and

849
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,559
uh and least amount of weeds and all

850
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,719
this and but we feel like that there

851
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,519
then is you know and and regenerative

852
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,720
agriculture and and different things but

853
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,558
um i think that biodynamics just kind of

854
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,278
to me a lot of times dynamics is sort of

855
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,759
just kind of also the icing on the cake

856
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,359
and like we're able to

857
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,919
do all these other things and then

858
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,798
biodynamics were able to just take it

859
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,600
that much further into

860
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,599
another realm of relating to and

861
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,199
understanding nature and the natural

862
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:40,319
systems around us i like that idea of

863
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,640
infusing meaning into farming by adding

864
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,639
these extra aspects like you you mean

865
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,480
you are just farmers right you've got

866
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,799
your you got your you know your these

867
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,319
techniques and those techniques but you

868
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,480
do it in a way

869
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:55,759
that um

870
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,120
allows room for for spiritual connection

871
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,558
as well

872
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:02,158
and um and you're right like even even i

873
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,918
you know some of the vocabulary i

874
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,960
struggle with a little bit

875
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,640
because i'm like i don't i don't know

876
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,800
what these words mean

877
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,599
and that doesn't mean that you know i

878
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,280
should

879
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,679
you know reject the ideas just because

880
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,359
some of them feel foreign to me

881
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,519
um you know this is this is merely an

882
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,398
introduction to biodynamics so just

883
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,039
because i don't know the vocabulary

884
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,679
um you know it inspires me to learn more

885
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,039
instead of to you know reject it as as

886
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,440
the other

887
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:32,000
um one more question before we go to

888
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,200
break where where um

889
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,480
when you're when when you consider your

890
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,838
planning of your farm for the season

891
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,039
um and we'll talk more about the

892
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,358
calendar later but that's not really

893
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:48,398
what i'm talking about i'm talking like

894
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:50,878
like do you have um like like multiple

895
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:53,118
layers of planning for your farm where

896
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,239
your plant you you're planting one layer

897
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,680
which is

898
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,719
the the the germinating the planting and

899
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,879
and

900
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,358
and harvesting of the plants and then

901
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,320
you have a second layer

902
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:09,119
which is the ritualistic spiritual

903
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,480
practices that you do in in

904
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,280
um in tandem with that um how do you how

905
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,119
do you plan a biodynamic farm when

906
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,519
you're when you

907
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,960
when you also want to make sure

908
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,119
that you have intention because like

909
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,960
like i forget to do important spiritual

910
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,240
practices in my life just because like i

911
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,559
get busy

912
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,639
or maybe i have too much caffeine and

913
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,440
then and then i'm just like i'm i'm just

914
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,838
doing my day it takes it takes effort to

915
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,000
be reminded to do

916
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,159
these these actual extra spiritual

917
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,838
practices that make us feel connected so

918
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,440
so i guess my question to you which i've

919
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,920
kind of backed into

920
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,639
is is how do you go about reminding

921
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,800
yourself to to incorporate the

922
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:54,319
biodynamics more spiritual practices

923
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,400
when you're also trying to just do the

924
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,119
day-to-day of a farm yeah that's a great

925
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,358
question i think i think that's also why

926
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,440
i feel like you could i kind of see

927
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,159
biodynamics as the icing on the cake of

928
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,880
the farm because you know we do have to

929
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,358
you we have to continue running the farm

930
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,599
and managing the farm and making sure

931
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:17,039
things are functioning um

932
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,920
i'd say also in a certain sense

933
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,199
those practices and kind of learning

934
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,480
about it

935
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:27,838
is done in a biodynamic way in that

936
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,199
it often it's it can be a bit

937
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:31,519
things are kind of structured in a

938
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,759
seasonal way like the preps are made at

939
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,159
different different times of the season

940
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,040
uh different times of the year but then

941
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:41,598
also like the winter time is a much more

942
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,159
inward slow time where we can kind of

943
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,079
like slow down and be able to do some

944
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,239
reading and do kind of more of that

945
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,039
inward inward work

946
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,000
as opposed to just

947
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:53,599
this

948
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,880
you know being outside trying to get

949
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,000
everything done

950
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,000
and um

951
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,760
i also just wanted to to touch on what

952
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,480
you were saying about you know kind of

953
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,800
the accessibility of

954
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,800
of the vocabulary and and learning about

955
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,599
biodynamics i wouldn't necessarily

956
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,200
recommend somebody who

957
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,559
knows nothing about

958
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,399
steiner and

959
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,239
anthroposophy to like pick up the

960
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,280
agriculture lectures

961
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,838
uh because it can it's it's not an easy

962
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,160
thing to read and he did give the

963
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,960
lectures to a group of people who

964
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:30,399
already had kind of like understood

965
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,039
a lot of his other um

966
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,000
uh practices and things so there was a

967
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:38,480
certain level of like

968
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,320
who he was delivering that to but there

969
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,119
is a really great book

970
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,720
um called culture and horticulture

971
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,559
that's by um

972
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,559
wolf stole is that her story

973
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,719
um it's called culture and agriculture a

974
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,799
philosophy of gardening and

975
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,639
culture and horticulture sorry culture

976
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,359
and horticulture

977
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:03,519
and it really does an excellent job of

978
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:07,440
like making the concepts

979
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,838
really simple and understandable to

980
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,800
uh to understand and a really great

981
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:15,119
introductory book to to biodynamics

982
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,000
fantastic well then uh i will look that

983
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,838
up myself and um and that is that is a

984
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,440
good point that the uh

985
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,320
you know some of these terms of art in

986
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,400
any

987
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,800
advanced discipline is kind of like a

988
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,160
secret language and not to let that be

989
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
off-putting so

990
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,078
all right so i think that i and you and

991
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,160
everybody listening is very excited

992
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,480
about learning more about these

993
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,719
spiritually enriched farming practices

994
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,358
so so let's go ahead and go to our first

995
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:43,039
commercial and we will be right back you

996
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:44,799
are listening to shaping fire and my

997
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,800
guests today are regenerative cannabis

998
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,800
farmers blair and daniel eau claire

999
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,880
once you've discovered the benefits of

1000
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:55,119
using cannabis it's a very small step to

1001
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,440
start making your own edibles gummies

1002
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,880
lotions tinctures and concentrated oils

1003
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,880
at home

1004
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,800
magical butter has been helping cannabis

1005
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,200
consumers become self-sufficient for

1006
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,280
over a decade with the easy to use

1007

extractor you can create high quality

1009
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,000
cannabis products to your exact

1010
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,000
specifications at a fraction of the cost

1011
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,679
of store-bought edibles

1012

1045
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,160
one of the challenges with buying

1046
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,479
autoflower seeds is that often you'll

1047
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,399
have as many different phenos as you

1048
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,559
will have seeds in a pack

1049
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,800
that can be fun sure but so many

1050
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,559
varieties in one pack is a sign of an

1051
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,000
immature seed line that hasn't been

1052
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,078
worked enough

1053
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,760
i prefer my autoflowers to be worked

1054
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,680
enough that each pheno in the pack

1055
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,079
really captures the aspects that the

1056
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:57,039
breeder was intending

1057
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,800
this is why i recommend gnome automatics

1058
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,599

1059

painstakingly sifted again and again

1063
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,719
tested in a wide range of conditions and

1064
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,920
taken to a level of maturity that each

1065
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,159
plant will be recognizable by its traits

1066
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,280
traits that were hard earned so that you

1067

biodynamics calendar because for me this

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,680
is this is how i first got turned on to

1150
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,599
biodynamics and i gotta admit i didn't

1151
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,078
have the most positive response to it

1152
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,240
right away i'm like why am i you know

1153

germinating seeds with the moon cycle

1154
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:35,039
and stuff it like you know how i was

1155
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,318
brought up um was much more mechanical

1156
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:41,039
farming and um and you know now of

1157
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:43,519
course i understand um the interplay

1158
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,279
between nature and and um you know

1159
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,000
friends have explained to me small parts

1160
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,359
of why we um germinate you know at

1161
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,639
certain times of the year which i'm not

1162
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:54,078
going to try to explain because you're

1163
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:56,799
about to um but uh but i'm excited to

1164
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,720
get to know more so um you know normally

1165
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,318
when we think about you know farming

1166
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,239
with the calendar we're thinking about

1167
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:04,880
weather right just like is it you know

1168
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,078
when's the last frost and and when does

1169
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,599
it get

1170
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,119
like the hottest time of the year and

1171
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,079
when do we have to be prepared for

1172
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,920
drought and and that's all true

1173
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,720
but in this idea that you presented

1174
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,358
during the first set of of kind of going

1175
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:23,439
beyond the basics of farming to this

1176
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:25,838
embracing of nature being alive there's

1177
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,480
this entire biodynamics calendar that

1178
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:31,039
exists that is supposed to guide us um

1179
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,480
for for most of the attributes or most

1180
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,039
of the actions that we take during

1181
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,280
farming so so please dive right into

1182
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,679
that and give us an example of working

1183
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,280
through a calendar year of of the

1184
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:42,318
biodynamics calendar when it comes to

1185
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,040
cannabis

1186
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,239
yeah sure so um i think one of the you

1187
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,159
know one of the biggest things i think

1188
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,399
you really brought up just comparing

1189
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,318
like the biodynamic calendar to like

1190
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,318
farming with weather like

1191
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,880
we can you know we can make those

1192
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,800
decisions of how we farm according to

1193
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,358
weather because we have legs and we can

1194
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,119
walk outside or come inside but you know

1195
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,358
plants are very much like weather is

1196
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,240
weather all year round they are kind of

1197
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,960
like subject to to whatever is going on

1198
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:13,118
and and the same with um

1199
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,559
as sort of uh

1200
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:20,240
and beings who are in the ground

1201
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,199
um constantly having the world and

1202
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,799
the

1203
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,399
the earth move

1204
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:29,599
around it and being affected by the

1205
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,400
by the planets and the the cosmic beings

1206
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,119
in

1207
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,480
in our solar system and so the

1208
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,720
biodynamic calendar um it originally

1209
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,159
wasn't something that steiner did it was

1210
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,199
actually created by um a woman maria

1211
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:44,399
tune

1212
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,399
and so

1213
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,358
um it wasn't indications given by

1214
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,000
steiner but she was definitely she was a

1215
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,480
a german biodynamic farmer

1216
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,440
and she did many experiments and trying

1217
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,920
to see sort of like the qualities of

1218
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,480
of what the elements of the earth and

1219
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,559
how that affects and and the

1220
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,440
constellations and the moon and the

1221
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:12,480
planets and how that affects

1222
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,318
um plants um so the one of the things

1223
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,800
that it does the way that it's sort of

1224
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:20,000
organized in many ways

1225
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,039
is by the the constellations

1226
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,639
by the zodiac and not in the way that we

1227
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:28,480
kind of look at it in traditional um

1228
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:31,118
sort of astrology where the

1229
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,960
constellations are divided evenly into

1230
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,000
like 30 degrees

1231
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,400
the

1232
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,358
the constellations in the biodynamic

1233
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,440
calendar are divided by

1234
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:44,159
um kind of their

1235
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,400
width and distance that they have

1236
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,399
um in the

1237
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,039
um

1238
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,559
in the year and so they take up

1239
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,239
different amounts

1240
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,079
of time so

1241
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,439
it's not like uh

1242
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,280
um

1243
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,200
like aries takes up uh

1244
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,000
you know a different amount of space

1245
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,358
than

1246
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,920
than taurus and gemini and so

1247
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,519
the basis of how

1248
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,159
those things are

1249
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,000
are indicated is more

1250
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,679
by the lunar cycle

1251
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,920
as the moon

1252
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,838
is passing through these constellations

1253
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,838
within a month

1254
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:26,880
it passes through these constellations

1255
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:29,279
for different amounts of time

1256
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,920
and then each of those constellations

1257
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,119
are related to an

1258
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,519
element fire earth air water

1259
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,280
and each of those elements are then

1260
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:42,400
related to

1261
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,720
uh different aspects of of the plant and

1262
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,599
sort of which part of the plant you are

1263
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,959
looking

1264
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,800
to cultivate or looking to grow so like

1265
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,559
the fire element

1266
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,359
is related to

1267
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,839
fruit so if you're trying to grow

1268
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,838
a tomato you would be looking at the

1269
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:00,719
calendar and seeing

1270
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:02,480
how

1271
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,759
or where the moon

1272
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,800
is in an element of

1273
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,480
of a fire planet or a fire constellation

1274
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,599
which would be

1275
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,880
aries

1276
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,838
leo

1277
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,880
and sat and

1278
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,279
sagittarius and so

1279
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,599
um the same would be so if you're trying

1280
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,000
to cultivate a root plant that would be

1281
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,519
the earth element and that would be

1282
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,280
something like

1283
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:31,039
a radish or a potato or something that

1284
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,680
you're trying to cultivate for root and

1285
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,639
so you would be looking at like where

1286
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,558
the moon is in those constellations

1287
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,598
and you know there's not like something

1288
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,760
you have to

1289
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,400
go in and figure out and discover

1290
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,960
there's calendars that are made that you

1291
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,200
can purchase

1292
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,880
our favorite one is the stella natura

1293
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,439
calendar

1294
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,119
but you can also get there is a maria

1295
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,679
tune

1296
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:00,318
calendar as well

1297
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,558
and then the same so for cannabis we

1298
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:03,679
would be looking more at the air

1299
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,519
elements

1300
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,279
and so that would be because that's

1301
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,759
related to flour

1302
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,760
and then if you're say growing

1303
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,839
lettuce or something or

1304
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,599
kale or leafy greens that would be

1305
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,639
related to the to the water element

1306
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,519
and so

1307
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,759
um if you're looking at the calendar

1308
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,480
you it would it would tell you

1309
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,800
at different times of like the moon it's

1310
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,000
usually around like

1311
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,880
three two three to four days

1312
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,400
um

1313
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,480
depending on

1314
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,119
the length of and the size of the

1315
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,559
constellation as the moon is passing

1316
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:44,640
through it uh would be like okay um you

1317
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,000
know on these days

1318
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:47,920
the moon

1319
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,960
is passing through

1320
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,480
um

1321
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,318
let's say so

1322
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,159
so for cannabis the moon is passing

1323
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,679
through an air sign like gemini

1324
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:00,558
uh

1325
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,318
for a couple days you may want to like

1326
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,079
that would be the time

1327
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:07,519
that hopefully it would also relate to

1328
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,359
that would be the time that you would

1329
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,280
start you know that you would want to do

1330
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,960
something with the cannabis

1331
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,200
that being said that would be i feel

1332
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,960
like on the more like strict side of

1333
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,159
things that you're constantly trying to

1334
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,800
do things

1335
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,719
when a certain

1336
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,119
uh when the moon is in a certain

1337
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,719
constellation reflecting that that

1338
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,280
energy

1339
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:31,118
for us as we as we

1340
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,920
have practiced things

1341
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,440
um

1342
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,559
we have found that it's more

1343
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,920
in

1344
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:42,960
we look at more of the larger cycles

1345
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,880
um as far as like the moon

1346
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,679
full moon and

1347
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,680
new moon and waxing and waning as far as

1348
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:52,719
how we relate to

1349
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:54,960
to planting and growing

1350
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:56,879
we find that it has it can have a

1351
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,800
tendency it was just like

1352
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,800
trying to run a farm and trying to do

1353
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,800
the daily work of like

1354
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,760
managing things and doing stuff that

1355
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,720
like

1356
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,480
we don't recommend really like trying to

1357
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,679
live your life by these planting

1358
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,440
calendars i think it um

1359
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,759
more than anything it also just like

1360
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,159
we've talked about creating

1361
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,440
imaginations and visualizations of

1362
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:23,598
things and kind of like looking at

1363
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,519
you know the constellations and the

1364
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,720
moons and the planets like they do have

1365
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:32,239
an effect on the plants and it kind of

1366
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:34,399
gives a a picture and a guidance to like

1367
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:36,000
that that can have an effect but you're

1368
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,838
not gonna like

1369
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,400
damage something or

1370
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,759
you know or do something like really

1371
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,599
uh

1372
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,400
really poorly if you're not gonna be

1373
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,480
like following the calendar strictly and

1374
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,838
so i think it's important always to have

1375
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,519
that um

1376
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,519
context that

1377
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,800
i think that it can feel a little bit

1378
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:56,000
like uh

1379
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,559
sometimes i feel like like you're

1380
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,559
following a textbook in a way like you

1381
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,319
said like it kind of can be a turn off

1382
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,400
because it's like oh i got to do this

1383
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,800
then or that then and it's kind of like

1384
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,880
a bit a bit restrictive and

1385
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,160
in my experience and

1386
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,920
um

1387
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:15,838
and i think daniel will talk about it

1388
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:18,480
too i feel like it really helps to just

1389
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:21,279
create pictures for this like whole

1390
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,599
other level of connection that the that

1391
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,079
the plants have to

1392
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,200
its environment and to the cosmos that

1393
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,039
we can

1394
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,399
maybe only

1395
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:35,358
begin

1396
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:37,760
and to imagine or understand and so

1397
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:38,799
um i think for me that's kind of like

1398
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,520
the

1399
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,599
the planting calendar and

1400
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,039
i uh daniel i have both you know

1401
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,680
apprenticed on a few different

1402
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:49,838
biodynamic farms and

1403
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:52,799
as far as like rt at least for me my

1404
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:55,039
teachers um one teacher like to say that

1405
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,920
there's the tunes and the untunes like

1406
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:59,679
the people who are into maria tunes and

1407
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,680
her and her planting calendar and the

1408
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,960
ones who don't really uh abide by it and

1409
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,279
so

1410
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,639
i think as far as like that is usually

1411
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,160
the first thing that people are

1412
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:14,480
introduced to in biodynamics and

1413
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,639
it's actually not even part of the

1414
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,838
demeter certification to plant by the

1415
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,440
calendar

1416
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:21,599
um

1417
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,000
so yeah that's kind of my summary of it

1418
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:27,760
daniel you have anything to add that was

1419
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,760
really awesome um like you were saying

1420
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,760
the new moon and full moon cycle is kind

1421
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,760
of more what uh we kind of go by i will

1422
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,280
say though if there is a day

1423
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,040
where everything is just kind of like oh

1424
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,798
my god i need some direction like what

1425
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:41,920
should we do it is helpful to say all

1426
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,838
right where's the moon right now and

1427
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,920
like oh it's a root crop let's go weed

1428
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,159
the carrots let's go cultivate like and

1429
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,960
it does provide some kind of framework

1430
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:54,159
to work with but um

1431
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,358
it seems like the for us the you know

1432
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:59,199
sowing seeds as close to the new moon

1433
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:01,440
as possible um

1434
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:02,960
especially coming into the new moon

1435
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,480
definitely not like after the first

1436
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,720
quarter like after

1437
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,679
when it's waxing but around that time is

1438
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:09,598
great for

1439
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,318
seed germination

1440
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,880
because it gives the seeds time to get

1441
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:17,440
their radical out get established in the

1442
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,160
soil and then by the time the moon is up

1443
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,240
and bright the first cotyledons are are

1444
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,879
able to absorb that light

1445
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:27,598
and um and that seems to work really

1446
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,039
well and then we also use the full moon

1447
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,480
as a time

1448
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:34,639
to if if weather permitting to spray the

1449
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,159
horn manure preparation because at that

1450
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,879
point the full moon

1451
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:41,679
as we know it affects all the water

1452
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,480
watery element of the earth and so it's

1453
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,798
a

1454
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,280
really good time to get that spray

1455
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:50,880
happening in onto the soil so that it

1456
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:54,319
can be utilized at that at that time

1457
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,240
and same with transplanting

1458
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,440
when the moon is dark it's better for

1459
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:59,519
the seeds to

1460
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,039
get put the transplants to get put into

1461
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,920
the ground so they can establish their

1462
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:05,519
roots and not be too overstimulated

1463
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,119
at night

1464
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,199
so at first you know when you were

1465
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,838
describing it i was thinking oh

1466
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,719
this is this is really much more about

1467
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:17,039
um of the above the ritual of the farm

1468
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:19,118
and to creating a context to give

1469
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,719
farming more meaning but then you just

1470
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,400
flip the script on me again and you're

1471
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:25,118
like oh well actually

1472
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,639
you know when when you germinate is is

1473
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,960
related to

1474
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,920
um you know the the additional

1475
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,000
brightness of the moon and and the i

1476
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,559
don't know the swelling of the water

1477
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,318
being pulled up you know and then and

1478
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,559
then with transplanting you want darker

1479
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:43,519
so it sounds to me like there's actually

1480
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:47,119
a combination of both there is this

1481
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:50,079
there is this kind of like um um

1482
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:53,440
belief framework um

1483
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,798
that is connected to the constellations

1484
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,119
which for

1485
00:56:54,798 --> 00:57:00,000
some farmers it will give the entire

1486
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,960
dance of the season more meaning but

1487
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,838
also

1488
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,119
um

1489
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:06,639
there are very real reasons behind much

1490
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,920
of it um

1491
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:12,239
where the the planetary bodies which we

1492
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,200
know have effects on earth are actually

1493
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:17,919
going to be influencing our crops

1494
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,598
yeah definitely and i think you know

1495
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,240
the the

1496
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,318
biggest influence the biggest planetary

1497
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,479
body that is that the plants are

1498
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:28,798
influenced by is the sun right that's

1499
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,960
like the larger kind of like everybody

1500
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:32,798
knows the sun is influencing the plants

1501
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,639
and their growth cycle

1502
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,798
and then i would say the secondary one

1503
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:38,639
is the moon and that one often i feel

1504
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:40,480
like if you are sort of like really

1505
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,879
paying attention and really in tune you

1506
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,440
can you can um

1507
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,079
you can definitely see

1508
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,000
what like a full moon and spring and

1509
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,880
you're like all those weeds were like an

1510
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,719
inch big and holy moly there how are

1511
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,039
they five inches now and we got to get

1512
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:00,399
them out of here something like that

1513
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:03,358
and so those i think those we can also

1514
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,480
we can definitely also visually see um

1515
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,838
really when you're really paying

1516
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,199
attention and then also just

1517
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:12,558
incorporating into like those examples

1518
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,759
that that daniel was giving um

1519
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,119
and then

1520
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,920
um

1521
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,838
as far as like as far as like harvest

1522
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,639
goes to with cannabis i think it's a bit

1523
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:25,119
more challenging often especially for an

1524
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:27,199
outdoor operation because you're kind of

1525
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:29,039
a bit more subject i feel like at least

1526
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,679
where we are to weather

1527
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:34,960
and sort of timing

1528
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:37,199
just trying to to get things in

1529
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,599
because it takes such a long time to

1530
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,919
harvest and kind of getting everything

1531
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:44,079
in on time and making sure there's not a

1532
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,639
frost or a rain we're kind of a bit more

1533
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,599
like can't necessarily really follow the

1534
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:52,558
calendar uh in that respect

1535
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,599
but then you know the the sort of

1536
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,839
the the planetary kind of like

1537
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,119
constellation influences

1538
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,558
are those much more

1539
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:05,039
imaginative and you could say kind of

1540
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:07,920
clairvoyant aspects that

1541
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:09,519
steiner was really um

1542
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,838
you know he didn't develop this but just

1543
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:14,880
in general that kind of philosophy of

1544
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:16,239
those ideas that we can't really yet see

1545
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,720
but

1546
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,199
but a picture to help understand and

1547
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:23,679
grasp them a little bit more

1548
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:25,919
for folks who are not familiar with the

1549
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:27,919
clairvoyant aspect would you just

1550
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,318
explain that a little bit what is what

1551
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,599
is this experience of clairvoyance and

1552
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:36,719
how does it relate to biodynamics

1553
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,160
clairvoyant i guess is a seer right

1554
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:39,358
someone who

1555
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:43,838
um

1556
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:45,119
can read the script so to speak um

1557
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:49,039
i don't we weren't saying we're

1558
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:52,480
clairvoyant uh but steiner um

1559
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:54,000
certainly was and i guess he

1560
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,719
would maybe describe that as like

1561
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,440
reading the akashic record um

1562
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:02,159
kind of like the big the big movie reel

1563
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,599
in the sky so to speak um but he was

1564
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,759
able to

1565
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,519
um

1566
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,319
that's where all these indications came

1567
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:09,759
from

1568
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,880
um

1569
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,839
the the speaking of elements as carriers

1570
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,079
of spirit or that there's this uh

1571
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,920
interaction from the cosmos to the

1572
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,599
earthly realm that

1573
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,720
um

1574
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,480
that permeates all of biodynamics so

1575
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,199
am i

1576
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,960
what more could like what do we say

1577
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,558
about clairvoyance so is that a good

1578
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,599
description yeah that works that works

1579
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,000
just fine

1580
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,599
i like this idea that you said of the uh

1581
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,159
you know reading the big movie script in

1582
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:42,880
the sky right it's the idea of of being

1583
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:45,199
aware that there is a storyline to life

1584
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,480
and a storyline to the seasons

1585
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,838
and be being aware of that instead of

1586
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,000
just um

1587
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:54,239
uh being counting and running the farm

1588
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,960
as a business so uh yeah i think that

1589
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:59,358
sounds uh like a great description so

1590
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,720
let's move on to the individual compost

1591
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:04,960
preparations and um i know that a lot of

1592
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:07,679
the the natural farming people who are

1593
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:10,400
here for the preparations less so much

1594
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:13,118
the the philosophy are probably glad

1595
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,039
that we're moving on to this um and and

1596
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,640
um you know a lot of people claim to

1597
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:21,039
have fantastic results with both these

1598
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:22,480
individual compost preparations and the

1599
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:26,079
spray preparations that we're going to

1600
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,880
be talking about in the third set so um

1601
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,200
so

1602
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,599
my my general understanding of how these

1603
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:33,919
work is that um

1604
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,798
biodynamics believes that you should be

1605
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:40,079
treating your compost piles with

1606
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:41,440
particular preparations of a very um

1607
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:46,079
specific

1608
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:48,400
group of of herbs and and they do they

1609
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,400
do it they do a certain job on nutrients

1610
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,000
in the pile so so i'm not going to try

1611
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,280
to explain it myself since this is not

1612
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,519
my specialty

1613
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,760
but but why don't you take us down um

1614
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:01,759
the path of these individual compost

1615
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:04,000
preparations um how to make them and and

1616
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:07,119
and what their roles are on the

1617
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,358
biodynamic farm yeah so i'll start with

1618
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:11,680
the caveat first instead of going into

1619
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,920
details and ending with a caveat at the

1620
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:15,598
end but i just wanted to say that you

1621
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,318
know we've been both been practicing

1622
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,318
biodynamics for quite a while and this

1623
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:23,199
past year was the first year that we

1624
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:26,318
actually made all the preps on our farm

1625
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:29,038
and we've always done it in in community

1626
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:31,599
in community groups and it's not it's

1627
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,200
not an easy thing to do and it's not

1628
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,359
like uh

1629
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,598
it's not something that's like easily

1630
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:39,759
achievable and um

1631
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,599
you know a big reason that we

1632
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,480
are at least for me like that i kind of

1633
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,000
also

1634
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,240
fell in love with this area of northern

1635
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,920
california and stuff was uh because of

1636
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,159
the

1637
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,960
b dank the biodynamic association of

1638
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,838
northern california and

1639
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,519
the quarterly meetings that would happen

1640
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,920
winter spring

1641
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:02,400
summer fall where we would make the

1642
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:05,119
biodynamic preparations together

1643
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,880
and then those would be um

1644
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,200
kind of uh

1645
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,480
taken care of by one of the

1646
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:13,279
practitioners

1647
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,039
one of my tea my teacher harold hovind

1648
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,760
and then you could buy the biodynamic

1649
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:20,000
preparations from the organization

1650
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,520
and there's other places to buy them

1651
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,639
also there's a really

1652
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:27,759
strong biodynamic group in oregon

1653
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:30,400
and um i believe there's a strong one in

1654
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:34,480
colorado and there's also

1655
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,318
a few on the east coast and so like

1656
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,400
in us describing these like i just don't

1657
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:40,480
want to feel like people have to feel

1658
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,639
like oh that's too crazy that's too hard

1659
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,760
i can't do that i think they're really

1660
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:46,719
made supposed to be done in community

1661
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,359
and

1662
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:52,318
and also that you know they they can be

1663
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:54,239
purchased from the pfeiffer center and

1664
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:56,239
and different organizations too that you

1665
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,078
don't have to make them on your own

1666
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,598
so that's just my first little thing i

1667
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,519
wanted to say and then daniel can go

1668
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,359
ahead and explain the preps

1669
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,880
all right that was really good yeah jpi

1670
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:06,400
josephine porter institute is another

1671
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,760
one yeah say that

1672
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,960
um

1673
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,480
so

1674
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,559
the the preps are

1675
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,079
discussed in the third lecture

1676
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,920
and

1677
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,680
in that he

1678
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,519
starts off by wanting to talk about

1679
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:23,279
nitrogen and nitrogen's role in farming

1680
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:25,119
and he brings up the what he calls the

1681
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,000
four siblings of nitrogen which is

1682
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:30,480
carbon oxygen hydrogen and sulfur

1683
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,519
which is what makes up proteins

1684
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,119
and

1685
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,358
so

1686
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,480
like we had said early on wanting to

1687
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:41,279
work with living chemistry like being

1688
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,960
able to bring living uh

1689
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,839
elements into the farm as opposed to

1690
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,880
working with uh synthetically derived

1691
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,519
elements

1692
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,680
he brings up uh different plants that

1693
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,880
have certain relationships to certain

1694
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:56,719
elements

1695
01:04:52,880 --> 01:05:00,240
and so starting from a place of

1696
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:02,399
recognizing an active interplay of

1697
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:03,598
spirit and form

1698
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,760
uh

1699
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:09,519
spirit manifesting in the earthly realm

1700
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:12,000
on a carbon framework

1701
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,000
there's

1702
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:17,280
the elements attach themselves to this

1703
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,960
carbon framework in different ways and

1704
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,200
so

1705
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,000
start wanting to make compost which is a

1706
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:27,838
great thing that can be done on farm

1707
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,838
which alleviates a lot of issues with uh

1708
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:32,400
with plant diseases and whatnot by

1709
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:35,119
providing the soil in the in the biome

1710
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,680
within the soil food the compost being

1711
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:39,920
food for the microbiome

1712
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:44,078
we want to make certain elements

1713
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,079
available to the plants as best we can

1714
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,720
and there are people who are creating

1715
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:51,119
more preparations still out of their own

1716
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:55,358
observations but the ones that he

1717
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:57,440
uh starts off with is um

1718
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:59,358
the the preps are the plants that are

1719
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,679
used in the preparations are yarrow

1720
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:03,598
chamomile nettle

1721
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:06,639
oak bark

1722
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:08,880
valerian and dandelion

1723
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,159
and like blair said this being the first

1724
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,559
this past year the first year that we

1725
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,798
were able to make the element

1726
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,640
the preparations on our farm that's not

1727
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,880
to say that we weren't growing all the

1728
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,879
prep plants on our farm and i think that

1729
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,318
that has been a really good

1730
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,880
uh teacher for us and a way of getting

1731
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,558
a real good authentic connection to

1732
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,760
these plants like we have yarrow growing

1733
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,640
everywhere

1734
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,280
there's dandelion popping up all over uh

1735
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:37,279
chamomile we continue to make more beds

1736
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,400
of chamomile even though they volunteer

1737
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,000
every every year um so

1738
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,079
growing the plants and living amongst

1739
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,480
them and using them for teas and whatnot

1740
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,119
to just gain a accustom

1741
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:52,079
to them is a great way to start

1742
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:54,640
but what he's saying here is that by

1743
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,760
harvesting these plants and putting them

1744
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,000
in a

1745
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,200
vessel

1746
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,599
and putting them in the earth to uh

1747
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:07,598
to absorb forces and to potentize them

1748
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,400
then become medicines that we can put

1749
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,920
into our compost pile to enliven the

1750
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,960
compost

1751
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,039
um and so let we can start with yaro and

1752
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,440
these were given numbers when they came

1753
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,440
to the new world like i the story that i

1754
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,358
am familiar with is that

1755
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,679
uh it was said that

1756
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:27,440
the americas would not take these things

1757
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,440
seriously if they didn't have a number

1758
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,960
attached to them

1759
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,599
so i forgive me if i don't know the

1760
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,920
numbers off the top of my head um

1761
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,000
but to speak about yarrow he says that

1762
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,880
the you know the nature spirits reach

1763
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,199
the highest the the height of perfection

1764
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,440
in their use of sulfur

1765
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:46,318
with with yarrow

1766
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,318
and

1767
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,960
so

1768
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:52,639
there's the carbon framework

1769
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,639
that

1770
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:57,199
the plants are composed of and then you

1771
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:59,920
have these elements that attach to them

1772
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:01,038
in different degrees

1773
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,440
so

1774
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,720
the yarrow being put into the bladder of

1775
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,960
a deer

1776
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:09,838
you enhance its inherent ability to

1777
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,480
combine sulfur with other substances and

1778
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:14,719
sulfur being a a really important part

1779
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,599
of plant health

1780
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,880
um

1781
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,679
chamomile

1782
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:22,798
is uh also has homeopathic amounts of

1783
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:25,679
sulfur uh but it works on calcium

1784
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:27,838
in addition to potash so that that is

1785
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:31,838
also a way of keeping plants healthy

1786
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:34,158
chamomile goes into intestines um

1787
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:39,039
so the way the vessels were chosen

1788
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:41,198
uh is very interesting um

1789
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,439
antlers are different than horns

1790
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:45,119
uh when we talk about the horns of a cow

1791
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,559
which the um

1792
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,759
i'm getting off topic a little bit but

1793
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,600
the horn manure preparation we see the

1794
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,838
manure going into a horn because the

1795
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,480
horns are a way of reflecting energy

1796
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,759
back into the animal whereas antlers on

1797
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:00,238
a deer

1798
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,679
have more of an outstreaming force and

1799
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,079
there's a relate relationship to

1800
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,199
nitrogen there and surrounding

1801
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:09,679
areas

1802
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:09,678
that has a relationship to the bladder

1803
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,158
the nitrogen being a very present uh

1804
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,399
component of urine

1805
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:17,358
he even says that a bladder is the is a

1806
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:19,039
perfect

1807
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:22,480
uh

1808
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:25,119
description or an image of the cosmos

1809
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:26,238
but yarrow being put into a bladder uh

1810
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,880
gets hung

1811
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:31,358
in a sunny spot all summer

1812
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,400
before getting buried into the

1813
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:36,640
uh the earth over the winter

1814
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:38,960
uh camomile has a relationship to

1815
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,838
intestines and we know this from just

1816
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:45,039
how chamomile tea is great for

1817
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,039
um digestion

1818
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:51,359
nettle is one that does not have a

1819
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:51,358
uh

1820
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,039
nettle does not have a vessel although

1821
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,920
some

1822
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:57,920
people

1823
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,719
are experimenting with

1824
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,119
um putting it in the

1825
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,800
um what's the sheath of the heart um

1826
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,880
the pericardium

1827
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,279
so nettle being the greatest benefactor

1828
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,840
of plant growth it it too contains

1829
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,119
sulfur uh assimilates and incorporates

1830
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,400
um

1831
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:16,880
a sulfur which assimilates and

1832
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:19,839
incorporates the spirit but currents of

1833
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,079
potash and calcium are also present in

1834
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,800
uh nettle iron

1835
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:26,800
is the one that we're after with uh the

1836
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,199
nettle preparation

1837
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,560
this one gets buried a whole year and it

1838
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:34,960
is

1839
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,960
infusing intelligence for the soil

1840
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:37,519
now

1841
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:42,480
in order to

1842
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,399
for wanting health on the farm

1843
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:47,839
we need to

1844
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:49,759
have a very broad view of

1845
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:54,719
interrelationships

1846
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,920
and calcium is a great medium

1847
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,198
for

1848
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,279
making those relationships

1849
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:03,359
you can almost never have too much

1850
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:06,158
calcium

1851
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:06,158
in your soils

1852
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:11,439
the oak bark is one that

1853
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,119
is put into

1854
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:16,559
the

1855
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:18,880
skull of a domestic animal

1856
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,880
and

1857
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,840
again this is like very important that

1858
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:26,479
we are choosing

1859
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,960
um in a situation like this we wouldn't

1860
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,919
want to use lime we want to use calcium

1861
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,760
from

1862
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,800
a living

1863
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,039
source

1864
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,039
um

1865
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:43,519
oak bark being

1866
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,520
a a material very high in calcium

1867
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,519
moving on to

1868
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,679
the the

1869
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,679
the dandelion preparation

1870
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:54,319
this is like the language that he uses

1871
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:56,158
is is really beautiful um i would

1872
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:57,039
encourage people to

1873
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:58,960
to

1874
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:01,439
try to read the lectures

1875
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,719
um dandelion is said to be a messenger

1876
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:04,399
from heaven

1877
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:08,719
that mediates the homeopathic

1878
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:10,960
distribution of silica and the cosmos

1879
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,640
the dandelion goes into the mesentery

1880
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,079
which is the

1881
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,560
um

1882
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,079
what the intestines are encased in in

1883
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,000
the animal

1884
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:21,039
and

1885
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,119
you know i don't really claim to

1886
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:24,800
understand all of this stuff i guess let

1887
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:27,039
me just say here that

1888
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,320
working with the preparations

1889
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:33,359
is a great practice of keeping your mind

1890
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:35,359
in a in a question like having more

1891
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:37,839
questions than answers

1892
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,759
and

1893
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,600
and i've said this before but like when

1894
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,039
you think you know all the answers to

1895
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,440
something that's a very dangerous place

1896
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:47,600
to be in um because there's a lot of

1897
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:49,198
different elements involved so when we

1898
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,719
work with these things

1899
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,158
i'm constantly wondering what we're

1900
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,640
doing

1901
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:57,119
but that's a really great place to be as

1902
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:00,320
you can receive kind of insights that

1903
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:00,319
you wouldn't expect

1904
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,199
silica

1905
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:06,319
is a very important

1906
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:07,198
element

1907
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:08,799
in

1908
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:11,279
in our practice

1909
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,039
and dandelion has a great relation to

1910
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,319
silicic acid

1911
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:15,279
and

1912
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:17,840
is

1913
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:20,238
said to be able to attract silicic acid

1914
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,960
from the atmosphere and make available

1915
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:22,959
to the plants

1916
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:29,520
lastly valerian is one that

1917
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:32,079
doesn't does not get a vessel does not

1918
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:35,199
get buried but his crush is pressed

1919
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:38,158
valerian flowers which has a

1920
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,439
a great way of stimulating phosphorus

1921
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:41,679
and so

1922
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:44,719
once these preparations are made and

1923
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,719
they've gone through the proper

1924
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:52,000
um burial and process they get added to

1925
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:52,719
the compost pile and

1926
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,039
the

1927
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:57,520
if we the more we work with compost and

1928
01:13:55,039 --> 01:14:01,198
the layering of plant materials from our

1929
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:04,000
farm manures straw bedding leaves

1930
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:08,000
gathering uh seaweeds putting all these

1931
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,760
things together you're creating a raised

1932
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,238
um

1933
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,560
you're you're creating a almost a living

1934
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:17,039
being so to speak

1935
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,120
and you're forming chaos

1936
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:23,279
within that compost pile there's gonna

1937
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,279
it's going to heat up things break down

1938
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:29,759
it becomes

1939
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:32,158
micro biologically alive

1940
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,600
adding these preparations is said to

1941
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,439
help to

1942
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,440
almost act as antenna

1943
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:39,439
to help bring form

1944
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,559
to the chaos

1945
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:42,960
chaos is

1946
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,080
a word for potential it you know it's

1947
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,560
not a bad word

1948
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:51,439
when things are in a state of chaos they

1949
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,840
are open to influence especially cosmic

1950
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,919
influence and adding these preparations

1951
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,719
is a way of helping to guide the prep

1952
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,880
the compost pile to a healthy

1953
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:02,319
decomposition

1954
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,840
and bringing

1955
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,799
the different elements that we need for

1956
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,279
healthy plant growth and soil biology

1957
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:12,239
to interact with each other

1958
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:15,198
so um each of these preparations sound

1959
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:17,919
like they take quite a long time um uh

1960
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:20,639
even even the unvesseled ones sound like

1961
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,960
it can be time consuming is is the idea

1962
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,600
generally that you would make

1963
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:29,920
these compost preparations this year to

1964
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:31,760
apply to next year's compost piles or or

1965
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,000
is it not does it not really take as

1966
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,400
much time as it sounds and you can

1967
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,279
actually use them same year

1968
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:41,839
no that is correct the it's the work

1969
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:43,359
that you do one year is for the benefit

1970
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,640
of next year

1971
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:49,359
and some of them take longer than

1972
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,800
than others like um some take a whole a

1973
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:53,279
full year

1974
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,039
whereas others are just buried over the

1975
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,559
the winter

1976
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:58,719
and so it is said

1977
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,000
that the earth is the most alive in the

1978
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:03,520
winter time

1979
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,198
and that can seem backwards but

1980
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,040
it's an in-breath

1981
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:10,479
that's happening

1982
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,238
um the crystal crystalline forces are

1983
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,839
are happening inside the earth at that

1984
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:16,158
time and it is kind of said that in the

1985
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,319
summertime the earth is dreaming

1986
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:19,839
in plants like the sun is actually

1987
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:22,158
putting the earth to sleep and it is

1988
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,960
dreaming in plant life it is

1989
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:26,719
like it it has to like the seeds have to

1990
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,198
germinate they have to

1991
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:31,359
um whereas in the winter time the earth

1992
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:32,799
is within itself and it gets a little

1993
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:35,439
complex with northern hemisphere

1994
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,119
southern hemisphere that is discussed in

1995
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:38,799
some lecture other lectures from the

1996
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:39,599
agriculture course but

1997
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,840
um

1998
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:45,039
and it should be said too that the

1999
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:48,079
amounts that are used in the compost

2000
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:50,880
pile is very minute it almost can

2001
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:53,198
sometimes seem like it's you're not even

2002
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,800
like how can this little bit of

2003
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,839
preparation make a difference in this

2004
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:00,560
compost pile so you it is possible

2005
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:03,039
for the if you make

2006
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,920
um you can make more than one year's

2007
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:06,640
worth

2008
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,560
uh in the fall does that make sense for

2009
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,000
sure so you're gonna you're gonna make

2010
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,920
them for this year but you're gonna make

2011
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,960
enough not only for yourself for the

2012
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,880
next few years but also to share because

2013
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,439
i get that whole community vibe trying

2014
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,199
to do all let's see one two three four

2015
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:22,079
five six of those

2016
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:25,039
um

2017
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,319
all by yourself on your same farm with

2018
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,158
like that sounds like very time

2019
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:30,559
consuming but if you've got a bunch of

2020
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:32,719
farms that are doing this um everybody

2021
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:35,600
can make them one season and then and

2022
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:38,079
then share them um at the grange hall or

2023
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,880
wherever and then um then everybody's

2024
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:44,399
got enough to last them a few years so

2025
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:47,679
that that makes sense both on a um you

2026
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:50,879
know a nutrition stabilization uh level

2027
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:52,319
for the compost pile but also for the i

2028
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,480
don't know the spiritual everything that

2029
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,960
was alive in our community connecting of

2030
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:59,198
humans and families also

2031
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,920
for sure it's it also happens like very

2032
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:03,919
close to harvest time so it can be like

2033
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,399
very inconvenient to make to have to

2034
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,800
make the preparations and you need a cow

2035
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:12,238
so not very many people have a cow to

2036
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:15,199
butcher an expendable cow

2037
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:17,599
oh yeah i can i can imagine the um the

2038
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:20,559
the the biodynamic supply store it gets

2039
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,039
pretty weird sometimes

2040
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,400
so so let's go ahead and take our uh

2041
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:26,560
let's go ahead and take our second

2042
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:28,079
commercial and we'll be right back you

2043
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,760
are listening to shaping fire and my

2044
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:31,840
guests today are regenerative cannabis

2045
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,320
farmers blair and daniel el claire we'll

2046
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,319
be right back

2047
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:39,519
for years organic cultivators have been

2048
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:41,519
looking for a peat moss replacement peat

2049
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,199
moss has long been the go-to soil

2050
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,520
amendment for water retention and

2051
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:48,079
container growing but organic growers

2052
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,640
are recognizing now that peat moss is an

2053
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:53,519
unsustainable resource and the mining of

2054
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:56,320
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and

2055
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,320
releases sequestered carbon but peat

2056
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:00,079
moss works so well that many have

2057
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:02,479
continued to use it

2058
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:04,800
now there is finally a revolutionary

2059
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:06,559
replacement for peat moss that provides

2060
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,480
better benefits while being a

2061
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,840
sustainable choice

2062
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:14,000
pit moss sounds and axe like peat moss

2063
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,239
but instead of being mined from fragile

2064
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,640
ecosystems is actually made from

2065
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:20,559
upcycled organic paper and cardboard

2066
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,039
headed for landfills

2067
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,960
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

2068
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:26,960
in your substrate and creating air

2069

2070

2073
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,119
carefully and locally sourced pit moss

2074
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:42,319
is the result of decades-long research

2075
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:44,800
into the use of recycled paper fibers

2076
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,719
pit moss is lightweight and easy to use

2077
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,320
and pin moss is inert so it won't change

2142
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:08,638
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

2143
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:10,559
growing is so valued by farmers is

2144
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,639
because the mycelium networks in the

2145
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,520
soil remain established from year to

2146
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:15,359
year

2147
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,440
and we know these fungal networks are

2148
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:19,759
essential because they are the nutrient

2149
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:22,479
super highways that extend far and wide

2150
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,480
in the substrate to feed your plants

2151
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,959
the trouble with growing in new living

2152
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:29,359
soils or blended cocoa substrates is

2153
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:32,639
that it takes most of the plant's life

2154
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:35,679
just to create these mycelium highways

2155

dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant

2156
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:40,800

2157
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,800
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

2158
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,199

2196
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,320
and my guests today are regenerative

2197
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:14,238
cannabis farmers blair and daniel eau

2198
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:16,559
claire all right so the big finish here

2199
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:19,919
with set three we're getting to the part

2200
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,000
um that is probably uh almost as popular

2201
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:25,279
as the biodynamics calendar when people

2202
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,679
talk about biodynamics and that is these

2203
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:29,679
uh these spray preparations and we're

2204
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,000
gonna start specifically the one that

2205
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:35,119
people talk about the most which is the

2206
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,840
the horn manure and the horn silica

2207
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:39,760
spray preparations and um you know this

2208
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,560
was the number one thing that i heard

2209
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,480
people talking about about um at uh

2210
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,320
emerald cup two i guess it's probably

2211
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,678
three years ago now um in the

2212
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:52,559
regenerative area the horn manure

2213
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:54,639
preparation demonstration is like i

2214
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,039
probably heard about that for like an

2215
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:59,520
entire year afterwards people talking

2216
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:01,039
about how interesting and engaged and

2217
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,520
how like they're like oh my god there's

2218
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:04,960
so many more aspects to learn and so i'm

2219
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,639
excited about learning this myself

2220
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,719
because i actually missed that

2221
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:12,239
presentation so let's start with that if

2222
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:15,520
you would please explain the the horn uh

2223
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:17,039
preparations um and and and how to do

2224
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,320
them sure thing well that's very

2225
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:20,800
interesting to hear i think that would

2226
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:22,399
have been um us that was there given

2227
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,239
that presentation

2228
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:25,198
and um

2229
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:27,759
the

2230
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:29,678
the horn manure preparation is really

2231
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,000
one of the most fun

2232
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:33,760
uh aspects of

2233
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,760
of biodynamics for me i feel like and

2234
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,039
it's a really great way of engaging with

2235
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,159
your land

2236
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:38,880
um

2237
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:41,198
in

2238
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,880
in this thought uh in the way

2239
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:45,198
biodynamics is presented and the way we

2240
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,800
start to visualize

2241
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:48,719
the farm like

2242
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,119
it's um

2243
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:52,319
we have to understand that the

2244
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:55,119
um

2245
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:57,519
the plants that we see on the earth are

2246
01:25:55,119 --> 01:26:00,000
said to originate in the farthest

2247
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:02,639
reaches of the cosmos

2248
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,319
the plants only exist because of the

2249
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:05,840
earthly realm

2250
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:09,198
and they are

2251
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:11,119
a mirror so to speak like plants

2252
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:13,839
the archetype of the plant is radiating

2253
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:16,238
out from this from the distant cosmos

2254
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,159
and manifesting on the earth being

2255
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:21,198
reflected back

2256
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:23,359
and so if you think of the

2257
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,879
that gives us a periphery

2258
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:26,880
and center

2259
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,159
image

2260
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:34,159
and we want the plants to be able to

2261
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:36,079
fully express themselves and

2262
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:39,519
and engage with the earth and be

2263
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:40,639
earthbound as best they can

2264
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,639
so

2265
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:45,039
a way of doing that

2266
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:47,600
and of enlivening the soil to allow for

2267
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:50,800
that connection to take place

2268
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,840
there is a field spray that is done

2269
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:57,360
throughout the spring and in the

2270
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:59,360
uh wet part of the year where there can

2271
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:01,920
be a

2272
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:04,639
the water allowing for

2273
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:07,520
the soil to receive the spray

2274
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,800
but you're taking the manure from

2275
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:12,080
a cow

2276
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:14,960
and putting it into the horn of a cow

2277
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:14,960
and that image

2278
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:21,520
if your imagination will allow you

2279
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:23,039
paints a picture of

2280
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,719
opposite ends

2281
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:26,800
coming together

2282
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:30,000
you have form

2283
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,119
on the on the one side of the with the

2284
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,679
horn

2285
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:36,319
and you have formlessness

2286
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:39,119
the manure from the other end being

2287
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:39,119
brought together

2288
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:43,759
then that is put into the earth

2289
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:47,600
over the winter time

2290
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,960
to absorb the the forces streaming down

2291
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,760
into the earth from the cosmos

2292
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,439
throughout the winter

2293
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,960
and all the activity that's happening

2294
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:57,519
under the ground

2295
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,439
so that way of taking

2296
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,480
two opposing ends and bringing them

2297
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:02,879
together

2298
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,399
is a reflection of

2299
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,119
the opposing

2300
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:09,519
periphery and center

2301
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:11,679
of the archetype of the plant and the

2302
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,639
earth at the at the center

2303
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,719
so

2304
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:16,400
this preparation then

2305
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:18,000
being unearthed

2306
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:21,439
from the ground

2307
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,960
is you'll see it teeming with um with

2308
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:23,839
michael reizel

2309
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,600
and

2310
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:29,039
it's it comes out uh if done long enough

2311
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:32,000
or you know buried at the right depth it

2312
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:33,039
comes out smelling delicious and is a

2313
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,359
very

2314
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:38,238
um

2315
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:39,359
earthy smell crumbly uh

2316
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:42,079
you know

2317
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:44,559
you can tell that it's potentized that

2318
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:46,238
it was it's gone on it's gone through a

2319
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,600
change

2320
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:50,638
uh this also being used in a homeopathic

2321
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,600
dose

2322
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:56,880
is then put into water

2323
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:59,199
it's like a tablespoon

2324
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,639
for like five gallons or so it's it's

2325
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:02,799
not very much

2326
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,719
um we tend to put a little bit more in

2327
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,840
ours because we feel like the land

2328
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:08,319
needed it

2329
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,000
needs it

2330
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:12,000
but this this then goes through a

2331
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
stirring process

2332
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,399
um

2333
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,960
and this this is something that will

2334
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:21,119
become individual for each person but it

2335
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,840
feels like an hour is a good amount of

2336
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:25,198
time

2337
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:28,159
you add this

2338
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:31,439
preparation into preferably rain water

2339
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:33,679
and it is stirred in one direction

2340
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:36,238
to form a a

2341
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:39,760
um an organized vortex

2342
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:42,000
for a minute and then that is

2343
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,719
thrust back on itself and stirred in the

2344
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,639
opposite direction also for a minute

2345
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:48,399
and then this process is repeated like i

2346
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:52,480
said for about an hour

2347
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:55,039
and in this process you will find

2348
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:57,919
a change in the water

2349
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:58,960
um one of more like organization at

2350
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,920
first

2351
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,600
it

2352
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:03,520
it splashes a lot you're gonna get

2353
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,360
splashed in the face and

2354
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,679
um

2355
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:09,519
and it's it's not as organized as you

2356
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,399
begin to do it the water seems to take

2357
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,520
on

2358
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:14,158
a more

2359
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:18,159
um organized component it's sometimes

2360
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:21,679
referred to as the fifth phase of water

2361
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:24,000
this is then sprayed over the fields

2362
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:25,760
like over your cultivated areas and even

2363
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,399
beyond

2364
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:30,560
uh in very minute doses i like to refer

2365
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:32,879
to it as micro dosing

2366
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,120
your your land

2367
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,119
uh this is done in the early mornings

2368
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:38,960
you want to be out there i'm sorry this

2369
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:41,279
is done in the evening

2370
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:43,279
so that it is given time

2371
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,119
to

2372
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:46,719
uh you you don't want it to evaporate

2373
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:50,000
you want to get it onto the land and

2374
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:52,079
then be have time to be absorbed

2375
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,600
uh and this is something that should be

2376
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:58,399
done on uh repeated

2377
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,239
um intervals and and that kind of that

2378
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:01,119
process is somewhat i would say up to

2379
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:04,718
you

2380
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:06,880
yeah but stick with it if you're

2381
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:10,158
you want to do it um

2382
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,279
after a rain uh like i said before when

2383
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:13,759
it's wet

2384
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:14,559
um you can you want to utilize the full

2385
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,400
moon

2386
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,719
because the full moon like we said

2387
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:21,519
before has a uh obvious effect on all

2388
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:24,399
the watery elements of the earth and it

2389
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:27,120
is it it can also help to propel

2390
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:29,439
what you are doing further

2391
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:31,359
uh like you're spraying minute doses on

2392
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:33,198
the land but then that full moon

2393
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:35,839
activating the water is being able to

2394
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:40,638
penetrate more deeply and with repeat

2395
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:43,039
sprays um you you know the benefits are

2396
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:44,960
what steiner says is

2397
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:47,760
and it seemed to suggest that he was

2398
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,520
aware of what mycelium was doing before

2399
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,520
mycelium was as

2400
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,080
um studied as it was but he says this

2401
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:56,239
will help bring in elements from beyond

2402
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:57,279
the cultivated space it brings in

2403
01:31:56,238 --> 01:31:59,119
elements

2404
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:00,800
being that everything is connected under

2405
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:04,000
the ground you're bringing in elements

2406
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,880
from your your woods from your fields

2407
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
from

2408
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,000
um

2409
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,319
where the animals are grazing so

2410
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,119
it's the horn manure preparation is

2411
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:16,079
helping bring the periphery down to the

2412
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:19,679
earth and allowing the plants to be

2413
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:19,679
to receive that

2414
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,719
radiation that's coming to them from the

2415
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:27,359
archetype in the cosmos

2416
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:30,399
the cosmos not just being a place of

2417
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:32,559
stars and comets but the the home of

2418
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:35,759
spiritual beings

2419
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:37,920
so that is a gravitational pull that you

2420
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:40,560
are providing the plant with the horn

2421
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,920
manure the horn silica

2422
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,000
is the

2423
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,880
counterpart to

2424
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,880
the

2425
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,880
the gravitational pull and it would be

2426
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:53,039
the levitational pole

2427
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:55,520
so this is finely ground quartz crystal

2428
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:59,920
that is made in the spring

2429
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,920
and is buried throughout the summer

2430
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:05,039
and winter

2431
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:07,440
dug up in the fall

2432
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:08,399
so this spray is then

2433
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:12,000
what you

2434
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:14,158
use to help the plant achieve its its

2435
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,238
ripening to allow it to

2436
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:18,479
uh go through its fruit-forming process

2437
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:21,119
it's flower-forming process that you

2438
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:23,039
want it's helping to allow

2439
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:25,679
what you are growing

2440
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:26,800
ripen in time and

2441
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:28,639
achieve

2442
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:32,800
the the health that it is

2443
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:35,679
uh capable of getting so you are as well

2444
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:38,719
spraying uh using minute doses

2445
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:40,560
of finely ground quartz crystal in water

2446
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,800
going through the same stirring process

2447
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,000
as you did for the horn manure

2448
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,639
and then

2449
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:50,000
spraying this onto your plants in the

2450
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:54,319
early morning before sunrise or just at

2451
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,158
sunrise in that dawn time

2452
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:57,198
and it is helpful to use a backpack

2453
01:33:56,158 --> 01:33:59,839
sprayer

2454
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:00,879
for this one when you apply the horn

2455
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,960
manure

2456
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:06,480
we use a combination of different things

2457
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:08,560
like little uh handheld brooms or

2458
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:10,238
cedar branches tied together and you're

2459
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:13,840
kind of just flinging the water all over

2460
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:17,198
the place i don't really like

2461
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:20,000
putting that mixture through a sprayer

2462
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:20,719
just because of the the pressure that

2463
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,639
the

2464
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:24,719
water goes through through the handle

2465
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,480
and through the whole process

2466
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,719
that doesn't feel as natural as just

2467
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:30,959
kind of flinging it from a bucket with a

2468
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:33,119
with some cedar branches

2469
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,399
but the the quartz

2470
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:36,880
spray the

2471
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:38,799
the horn silica

2472
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,719
is much more conducive to being sprayed

2473
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,360
through a backpack sprayer and you're

2474
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,359
trying to

2475
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,280
cover you want to

2476
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:49,198
kind of feel like fill in the aura of

2477
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:50,960
the plant you're spraying above it

2478
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:53,279
you're and you can see it you're just

2479
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:56,079
kind of misting and then falling and

2480
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:58,238
mixing with the dew that's on the plants

2481
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:00,000
um

2482
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:01,359
and as the sun's coming it's a really

2483
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,479
beautiful fun

2484
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:07,519
uh process to to go through and so the

2485
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:09,599
horn manure you're spraying at the time

2486
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,560
in the spring to help get the roots

2487
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:14,639
established the quartz the horn silica

2488
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,679
you're spraying in the early summer

2489
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:17,679
whenever

2490
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:19,600
whatever you're growing once you start

2491
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:22,639
to see the ripening fruits of what

2492
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:26,880
you're doing you want to start spraying

2493
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,880
the quartz the horn silica then so

2494
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:31,439
we often start our spray for the

2495
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:32,960
cannabis at the end of july beginning of

2496
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,359
august that's what we have found is when

2497
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,439
anthesis begins on the plants and so

2498
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:40,479
from that point on we're spraying

2499
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:42,879
uh you know every other week or like

2500
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:45,359
three to four times throughout the the

2501
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,920
ripening season

2502
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:49,920
um what have i missed i was just gonna

2503
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,960
mention a little bit like why the cow

2504
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,118
horn

2505
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:56,319
and i think in general in biodynamics

2506
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:58,319
cow horns are really important like um

2507
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,639
in certification you're not allowed to

2508
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:03,359
have cows without horns and

2509
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:06,480
unfortunately it's uh you know it's a

2510
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:07,839
common practice to remove horns from

2511
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:11,039
cows

2512
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:13,199
and the cows horns are extremely

2513
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:16,158
important for the cows their sinuses

2514
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:18,079
actually go up into the horns

2515
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:20,960
and um

2516
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:23,198
in there is part of

2517
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:25,359
the cow just in general is this very

2518
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:28,158
sort of meditative

2519
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:30,719
very focused on digestive animal when

2520
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:33,839
you see it it ruminates you know that's

2521
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:36,560
where that whole word comes from it eats

2522
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,119
its food but then after it does that

2523
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:41,119
it'll then sit down and start ruminating

2524
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:43,519
and it'll actually has four you know the

2525
01:36:41,118 --> 01:36:45,519
cow has four chambers a four chamber

2526
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,159
stomach and that

2527
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:50,320
food that it eats gets moved around into

2528
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:51,759
these four chambers actually comes back

2529
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:54,079
into the mouth

2530
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,320
after it's been eaten they continue to

2531
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:58,479
chew it and then goes back down

2532
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,399
and all this process that happens within

2533
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:01,839
the stomach

2534
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:04,158
and uh

2535
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:07,039
that sort of like the flavors and the

2536
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:09,679
taste and the digestion gets circulated

2537
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:11,600
within the horns too and it's kind of

2538
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:14,000
said that the horns have

2539
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,639
a bit

2540
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:19,039
of like the cow is kind of like the guru

2541
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:21,760
of the meditative guru of the

2542
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:24,479
of the animal world and it has sort of

2543
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:26,719
this connection the horns to to the

2544
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:28,879
cosmos the the horns and the

2545
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:31,279
hooves kind of contain

2546
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:33,039
are kind of the two ends of the of the

2547
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:36,000
animal that kind of contains this

2548
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:37,840
digestive process and has much more of

2549
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,560
that um

2550
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:42,880
solid sort of formative process

2551
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,199
and you know like uh

2552
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,279
pyramids and cones and that sort of

2553
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:48,879
thing kind of have this very

2554
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:51,840
uh

2555
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,600
kind of formative condensing

2556
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,960
shape as far as

2557
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,400
um they're

2558
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,679
what they look like and so putting

2559
01:37:56,399 --> 01:38:02,238
manure into the into this vessel

2560
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:03,199
really creates that sort of um kind of

2561
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:05,198
what we're talking about when you're

2562
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:06,879
stirring kind of going from this chaos

2563
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:08,799
this like very

2564
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:12,000
loose substance manure and putting it

2565
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,119
into this highly highly formed

2566
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,158
uh

2567
01:38:13,118 --> 01:38:17,359
very

2568
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:18,559
uh complex thing that is that is the cow

2569
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:20,559
horn

2570
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,880
and then you're also

2571
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,880
on top of a layer that goes on top of

2572
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,960
that is as you're stirring

2573
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:30,319
you are able to imbue

2574
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:32,239
your own forces into the mixture like

2575
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:33,359
it's very important to be aware of your

2576
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:35,919
thoughts

2577
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:38,639
as you're doing that um

2578
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,000
and it's amazing to see how your

2579
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:42,960
thoughts can travel

2580
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,760
within that hour but having an intention

2581
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,480
that you bring into what you're doing uh

2582
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,960
is

2583
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:50,718
i i we feel is definitely felt

2584
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:53,439
and i think that like two these

2585
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:56,800
preparations can be purchased um from

2586
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:59,279
different biodynamic groups and um

2587
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:03,039
or the josephine porter institute

2588
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:06,079
and um i think that that's almost

2589
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:07,600
in a way more important than making them

2590
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:10,158
is super important but it's not

2591
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,600
something you have to do but it i think

2592
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:14,000
i'm so glad daniel brought that up

2593
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:16,320
because it really is this

2594
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,639
meditative process that happens within

2595
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:20,799
the stirring and

2596
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,800
i think just in general in biodynamics

2597
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,719
your intention and your footprints and

2598
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:26,960
your presence on the land is so

2599
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:29,039
important and i think that that that

2600
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:32,960
spraying these preparations give you

2601
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:34,800
gives you a moment to pause and to

2602
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:38,000
focus more

2603
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:40,239
on our sort of like mental intentional

2604
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,960
ways that we are uh working with the

2605
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:44,399
land and part of me as we're as we're

2606
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,480
talking about this i'm trying to think

2607
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:48,960
about what people might be thinking

2608
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:51,678
about this and i will bring up and and

2609
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,279
just be honest that

2610
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:55,760
it was difficult

2611
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,920
to and still somewhat is it's something

2612
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,400
that i think about a lot like

2613
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,880
how is it that we are taking

2614
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:05,920
this crystal from the earth and smashing

2615
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,760
it up smashing it to pieces

2616
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,239
and then spraying it on our fields like

2617
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,639
there's an extractive element to that

2618
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:15,759
and uh steiner

2619
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,560
says that by doing this we are freeing

2620
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,880
up

2621
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,920
elemental beings

2622
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,920
that

2623
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,679
the crystals are home of elemental

2624
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,480
beings they're an impression that the

2625
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:29,039
earth has felt over time

2626
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:31,198
that we are then able to release and

2627
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:32,639
this takes us down a really

2628
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:35,359
long

2629
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:37,440
rabbit hole of how

2630
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:39,118
what is going on with the mineralization

2631
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:41,439
of the earth and how we're transforming

2632
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:45,679
the mineral element of the earth

2633
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:46,559
the mineral realm is being transformed

2634
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:49,600
and

2635
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,039
not always with the best of intentions

2636
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,920
um

2637
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:56,800
but it is one to meditate on like how

2638
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:59,520
this fits into to that

2639
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:02,960
and i will just say that it feels

2640
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:06,480
i i have come to peace with it a bit

2641
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:10,158
when this process is done

2642
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:12,879
in a way that we hope is serving

2643
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:15,039
nature and the ecology that surrounds us

2644
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:16,639
because there is a

2645
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:18,319
destructive element it feels like that

2646
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:19,920
you're taking a quartz crystal really

2647
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:22,960
beautiful

2648
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,840
uh symmetrical divinely shaped thing and

2649
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,399
then

2650
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:29,520
smashing it into pieces where the

2651
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,479
surface area is larger than

2652
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,880
the

2653
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:34,479
the whole of the plant we there's a

2654
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,000
mentor that we

2655
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:37,279
um

2656
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,920
uh

2657
01:41:37,279 --> 01:41:42,238
engaged with uh who gave an imp uh

2658
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:44,079
demonstration of the

2659
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:46,079
of quartz crystal showing how he held

2660
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:48,319
the courts and dropped it into his hand

2661
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:50,238
there's the gravity pull and then he

2662
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:51,679
crushed this thing up to a point it was

2663
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:52,479
in his hand he just blew on it and it

2664
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:55,679
just

2665
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:58,638
lifted up into the air in this uh way of

2666
01:41:55,679 --> 01:42:02,000
demonstrating levity and so i just want

2667
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:03,199
to say that there is a um

2668
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,560
tension

2669
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:08,158
that kind of exists in in the horn uh

2670
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:10,560
silica prep

2671
01:42:08,158 --> 01:42:12,960
because manure is very available you

2672
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,480
know uh feed your cow and you'll get

2673
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:17,279
something out of it but the harvesting

2674
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:18,399
of quartz crystal is something that is a

2675
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:20,960
bit more

2676
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:23,359
uh of a of a stretch so i just wanted to

2677
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:25,439
to bring that up right on

2678
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:26,839
so um you know

2679
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:29,919
so much of this

2680
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,039
preparation i mean i recognize parts of

2681
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,079
it

2682
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:34,319
um

2683
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:37,519
as foliar prep right just like things

2684
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:39,359
that i i have done many times

2685
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,679
in different recipes

2686
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:43,920
but then there is then there are these

2687
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:45,039
additions that are you know

2688
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,158
stir it

2689
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:49,519
you know

2690
01:42:46,158 --> 01:42:51,439
in in in clockwise for

2691
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:54,000
um you know x amount of time and then

2692
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:56,399
and then and then immediately just stir

2693
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,158
it the other way and so so that you're

2694
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:01,198
getting some of that chaos and then it

2695
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:02,719
and then it reorganizes itself and

2696
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,359
and it's interesting because there

2697
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:08,560
really is a blending of

2698
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:10,079
organic practices that i recognize that

2699
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,760
i'm like oh i've done something that

2700
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:13,279
like that before

2701
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,840
and then there and then and then

2702
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:18,880
suddenly you're talking about how

2703
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:22,560
the the horn manure prep

2704
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:25,039
is is an illustration of the beginning

2705
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:26,719
and the ending and completion of nature

2706
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:28,079
because since the horn is on the head of

2707
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:29,760
the cow and the

2708
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:31,760
and the manure comes out the back end

2709
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,280
and i'm like oh my gosh i thought i was

2710
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,039
in the i was you know for a second there

2711
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:37,198
i thought i was in the realm of of

2712
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:38,960
scientific preparations that i know and

2713
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:41,359
then now now suddenly i'm in the

2714
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:43,439
dreaming you know and i'm and i'm and

2715
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:46,719
i'm and i'm i'm doing a

2716
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:48,638
an imaginative energetic preparation

2717
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:51,679
that is causing me to

2718
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:54,400
sit down and reflect and get manure on

2719
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:57,118
me and think about how it's not dirty

2720
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:59,439
like suddenly it gets like really big

2721
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:01,039
a a prep that sounds like something that

2722
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:04,399
i want to do

2723
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:07,198
to have my cannabis plants um grow and

2724
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:09,679
my farm to be abundant and healthy has

2725
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:11,919
suddenly turned into

2726
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:14,239
you know personal mysticism and personal

2727
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,520
growth and i'm like oh my god there's so

2728
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:18,399
much here

2729
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:20,960
and it kind of makes biodynamics like i

2730
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:23,039
don't know i i guess um i'll say a bit

2731
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:26,079
slippery and not in any disrespectful

2732
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:29,439
way it's kind of like biodynamics is

2733
01:44:26,079 --> 01:44:30,319
is kind of different for everybody where

2734
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:32,638
where

2735
01:44:30,319 --> 01:44:35,118
you learn biodynamics

2736
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:37,760
and and it's in this this it's

2737
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:39,439
collection of philosophies and

2738
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:42,560
preparations

2739
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:44,960
and then after that it's given to you

2740
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,960
and then each farmer will make it their

2741
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,920
own based on their

2742
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:52,719
personal life experience and like i dare

2743
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,239
say what the farm tells them and if i

2744
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:57,198
would you know if i would to say that to

2745
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:59,279
most groups of cannabis people

2746
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:02,399
i think that um i would get some eye

2747
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,198
rolls but hearing you talk about it

2748
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:06,238
um

2749
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:09,039
you know it sounds it sounds less like

2750
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:11,678
an eye roll and more

2751
01:45:09,039 --> 01:45:13,920
like a

2752
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:16,319
like a spiritual practice that has

2753
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:18,960
meaning to each individual people but

2754
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:21,599
maybe not in the same way to a group

2755
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,520
and um and

2756
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:26,880
and that's i you know i find that to be

2757
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:28,400
a rare thing in cannabis right and um

2758
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,800
and what so so what are your thoughts on

2759
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:35,359
that being as much of a spiritual

2760
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:36,320
practice as it is you know fertilizer uh

2761
01:45:35,359 --> 01:45:39,920
well

2762
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:41,599
we ask a lot of our of the land

2763
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,158
um

2764
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,199
it's i it doesn't feel comfortable for

2765
01:45:44,158 --> 01:45:47,759
me to

2766
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:49,359
to expect the land to continue to

2767
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:52,000
provide

2768
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:54,158
without any sort of

2769
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,039
uh recapitulation

2770
01:45:54,158 --> 01:46:00,000
and ever since learning about these

2771
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:03,039
ideas and these practices it hasn't felt

2772
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,399
right for me to not do them

2773
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:05,600
um

2774
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:09,920
the land

2775
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:12,000
provides it's abundant and it um

2776
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,000
but

2777
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,399
it needs to be have something given back

2778
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,719
and if this in this is a small part of

2779
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:21,198
that but it does feel very important and

2780
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,399
it is very much a spiritual um

2781
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:23,759
practice

2782
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:27,118
um

2783
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:28,560
one that helps to connect us to the land

2784
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:30,000
us to the plants

2785
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,840
um

2786
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,800
dare i say the cosmos

2787
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,639
and

2788
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,719
um

2789
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:38,800
and i think uh i

2790
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:40,800
kind of somewhat of a famous quote from

2791
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:43,360
steiner is that

2792
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:46,239
you can never have a spirit without

2793
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:48,158
matter or matter without spirit and so i

2794
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:50,479
think that kind of sums up where where

2795
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:52,479
he's coming from and that

2796
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:54,479
we can't ignore the

2797
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:58,718
the unseen but

2798
01:46:54,479 --> 01:47:01,439
i think try to recognize and and embrace

2799
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:03,198
things that we can feel

2800
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:04,719
yeah i like that idea things that we can

2801
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:06,479
feel you

2802
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:07,679
something that i just wanted to tag onto

2803
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:11,039
that when we were talking about the

2804
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:13,840
preparations um i failed to to bring

2805
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:16,479
nitrogen back into the the situ

2806
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:18,880
the equation we talked about the other

2807
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:22,399
siblings carbon oxygen hydrogen and

2808
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:25,600
sulfur but nitrogen never came back up

2809
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:27,599
and i was just reminded of it because

2810
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,679
he says that

2811
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,920
farmers should meditate

2812
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:32,880
and it's very important for them to do

2813
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,079
so

2814
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,600
but when

2815
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:38,000
but be aware of actually what we are

2816
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:40,719
doing when we meditate and he says that

2817
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,279
we're we are growing into an experience

2818
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:45,118
of the nitrogen that surrounds you

2819
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:46,559
because we think of nitrogen as

2820
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:48,319
something that you need to feed to your

2821
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,360
plants in order for them to grow but the

2822
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:54,319
nitrogen is there what he says

2823
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:55,359
as a way of

2824
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:57,519
of

2825
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:58,960
allowing the other elements to work

2826
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,600
through the plant

2827
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:03,118
and so when we sit down and meditate we

2828
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,639
are growing into

2829
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:06,158
the nitrogen in the atmosphere which

2830
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:08,400
there is a lot of

2831
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:10,719
and then that is where we are able to

2832
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:13,039
get impressions from the farm and from

2833
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:16,319
the land that we might not have had we

2834
01:48:13,039 --> 01:48:19,679
not taken the time to to do that and

2835
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:21,279
stirring 500 is a great uh meditation

2836
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:22,560
meditative practice

2837
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:24,479
um

2838
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,400
and so

2839
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:28,959
yep that's that's what i wanted to bring

2840
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:30,879
to that right on so you know i'm sure

2841
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:33,520
there are people that are listening

2842
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:35,118
who are considering the the spiritual

2843
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:37,280
aspects but then they they also actually

2844
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:39,039
want to do these preps and

2845
01:48:37,279 --> 01:48:41,359
um so much of what we're doing in in

2846
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:43,840
regenerative and natural farming right

2847
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:46,158
now are you know you know variety of

2848
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:47,840
preps and fermentations you know a lot

2849
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:51,920
of them coming from

2850
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:54,000
korean natural farming how how does

2851
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:55,920
how do these preps play with the others

2852
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,359
you know from what i'm hearing from them

2853
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,279
it actually sounds like they're all in

2854
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:01,198
the same gang and and all these

2855
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:04,158
different preps can work together with

2856
01:49:01,198 --> 01:49:06,479
the the other um natural farming preps

2857
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:09,359
that that we might be more familiar with

2858
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:11,678
but but i bet i better ask because there

2859
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:14,559
might be some part of the the spiritual

2860
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:17,118
structure that makes that um not as

2861
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:19,360
applicable so so how do these preps

2862
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:21,279
interact you know and play nice with

2863
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:23,598
other natural farming techniques i i

2864
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:26,399
think they play great with each other um

2865
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:29,039
i think that it's you know it's all i i

2866
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:31,920
feel like um we don't practice very much

2867
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:34,319
korean natural farming but we do we do

2868
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:37,039
do some other fermentations

2869
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:39,439
um with plants and stuff and so

2870
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:41,439
i i don't think you should like i would

2871
01:49:39,439 --> 01:49:43,118
never say you should do one or the other

2872
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:44,638
i don't believe that at all and i think

2873
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:47,118
that

2874
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:48,319
it's important to grasp on all different

2875
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:51,439
kinds of

2876
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:53,359
of of agriculture and i think it's

2877
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:55,359
it i think things go wrong when you

2878
01:49:53,359 --> 01:49:57,039
start to

2879
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:59,198
think you should only be farming a

2880
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:01,039
certain way and that i think it's

2881
01:49:59,198 --> 01:50:03,759
important to gather from

2882
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:06,158
all different types of of practices and

2883
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:08,320
and utilize the ones that feel good good

2884
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:09,679
to you and you know that's you're you're

2885
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:11,679
creating your farm individual

2886
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:15,199
individuality and

2887
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:17,760
and creating the systems that work

2888
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:20,319
best for you

2889
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,079
right on so the horn manure is a way of

2890
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:24,479
um it's almost like a

2891
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:26,800
imo collecting collection oh yeah this

2892
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:27,678
is it is kind of like an imo for sure

2893
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,079
yeah

2894
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:32,000
yeah so so there a lot of them are are

2895
01:50:30,079 --> 01:50:34,399
sharing a lot of the same you know

2896
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,479
overall strategies even though the form

2897
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:37,759
and certainly in this case the the

2898
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:38,879
spiritual

2899
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:42,079
intent

2900
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:44,480
is is certainly more involved and so to

2901
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:46,238
kind of you know finish up this show

2902
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:48,879
with that you know i guess spiritual

2903
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:50,959
intent vibe um you know when i when i

2904
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,520
when i talked to y'all before

2905
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,599
our recording and and

2906
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,440
and and read some of the steiner stuff

2907
01:50:55,599 --> 01:51:00,400
everything seems to be very

2908
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:02,319
future focused there seems to be a real

2909
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:05,920
awareness of

2910
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:07,840
of inertia and that you know we we know

2911
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:10,158
we're going to end up in the future and

2912
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:13,599
so let's try to do something now so the

2913
01:51:10,158 --> 01:51:16,000
future is better so um would you both

2914
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:18,960
take us out with a couple words on this

2915
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,960
idea of biodynamics as a vehicle towards

2916
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,960
the future because honestly we just

2917
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:25,840
don't we don't get a lot of that in a

2918
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:28,880
lot of the other um

2919
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:31,440
farming traditions for sure and

2920
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:34,880
thank you for asking it

2921
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:36,960
what really attracted me to biodynamics

2922
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:40,560
is that it does speak to us in a way

2923
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:42,800
that i had not found in other literature

2924
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:44,480
and other

2925
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,719
philosophies

2926
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:46,718
and

2927
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:52,079
when when we speak of the earth as a as

2928
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:53,199
a living being uh that

2929
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:55,760
that's something that can just kind of

2930
01:51:53,198 --> 01:51:56,559
get said and then we move on to the next

2931
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,719
thing

2932
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,840
but um

2933
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:01,679
through

2934
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,400
familiarizing ourselves with steiner's

2935
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,840
work

2936
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:05,519
he is

2937
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,319
very much

2938
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,760
wanting to drive home that we are living

2939
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:12,639
on a

2940
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:14,840
highly developed spiritual being

2941
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:17,359
and

2942
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:19,440
the we are

2943
01:52:17,359 --> 01:52:20,960
locked into this

2944
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,039
um

2945
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:25,279
direction towards the future

2946
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:27,279
of which we need

2947
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:29,519
we're here to learn lessons of how to

2948
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:32,559
make that future happen

2949
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:34,880
and the plants are one of our first

2950
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,080
teachers in doing so

2951
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,400
and so

2952
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:42,079
when we work with the land when we work

2953
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:44,079
with these imaginations that we find

2954
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:46,079
the imaginations that give us the ideas

2955
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:47,760
of making these preparations of putting

2956
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:49,920
these herbs into these vessels when we

2957
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,920
work with these ideas at first they can

2958
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,199
seem far out

2959
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:56,719
and they are

2960
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:58,879
but they start to bring up feelings

2961
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:01,520
that

2962
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:03,520
that teach us lessons of of of where

2963
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,239
we're going um

2964
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,840
the

2965
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:07,598
and what is that what is the lessons

2966
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:10,840
that the plants are trying to teach us

2967
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:14,560
and what is being said is

2968
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:15,920
that when we learn to

2969
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,560
to um

2970
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:21,199
when we learn to coexist with each other

2971
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:23,199
the way plants coexist with each other

2972
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:26,319
we will be in a place

2973
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:28,238
receptive to feel the love that we can

2974
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:30,719
freely give

2975
01:53:28,238 --> 01:53:32,718
back to the creator

2976
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:35,520
and so

2977
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:37,679
when we observe the way plants of

2978
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,760
different species grow next to each

2979
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:42,239
other and seem to

2980
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:44,159
be good companions for each other we

2981
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:46,079
think of what's happening under the soil

2982
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:48,879
with the roots we think of the

2983
01:53:46,079 --> 01:53:50,238
communication that's going on

2984
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,400
we feel

2985
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:55,678
we see that there is this

2986
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:57,519
idea that one cannot be happy if the

2987
01:53:55,679 --> 01:54:00,319
other is not happy

2988
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:02,320
and we learn how plants are able to

2989
01:54:00,319 --> 01:54:05,279
help bring in

2990
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:07,359
uh nutrients from afar if if someone if

2991
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:11,039
a different plant needs it we see this

2992
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:12,079
communication that is done out of the

2993
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:14,960
um

2994
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:17,359
freely given like a

2995
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:20,560
a gift economy so to speak right like we

2996
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:23,118
do this as a way as an offering

2997
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:25,520
and um i believe that very

2998
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:27,439
wholeheartedly that

2999
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:30,480
when we engage with the land when we're

3000
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:34,319
farming we are not just farming to

3001
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:36,638
um create like substance for us to eat

3002
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:40,000
we are

3003
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:41,760
beautifying the surroundings that our

3004
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,158
senses will gain nourishment just as

3005
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:45,199
much as we gain fuel

3006
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:48,638
uh

3007
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:52,319
to to exist um we need to eat but we

3008
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:55,039
also need to absorb beauty and kindness

3009
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:59,198
and biodynamics

3010
01:54:55,039 --> 01:55:02,319
is what awoke me to these ideas

3011
01:54:59,198 --> 01:55:02,319
in these imaginations

3012
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,800
and it goes on from there then once we

3013
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,920
uh

3014
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:11,279
exit the um the plant realm we attain

3015
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:13,359
the animal

3016
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:15,039
consciousness where we learn to feel

3017
01:55:13,359 --> 01:55:18,479
into the other being

3018
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:20,880
and then we move on to only will we be

3019
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:24,000
truly human when we are able to

3020
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:26,639
understand the ego of another

3021
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,760
um as we understand our own and it gets

3022
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:32,800
uh it goes on from there but um i do

3023
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,320
believe what biodynamics has to offer

3024
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,679
beyond

3025
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:39,439
other philosophies is this

3026
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:41,840
larger picture that we're dealing with

3027
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:45,519
things more than just elements more than

3028
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:47,440
just nutrients we're dealing with

3029
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:48,960
transformation

3030
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:50,719
metamorphosis

3031
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,118
and growth

3032
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:55,599
uh that will bring us into the next

3033
01:55:53,118 --> 01:55:56,559
stages of of spiritual

3034
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,000
um

3035
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:00,080
spiritual development and the next

3036
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,880
evolution of the earth that we are all

3037
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:05,359
caught up in well certainly um i think

3038
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:07,359
that all of us who are regenerative

3039
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:08,479
farmers and and i don't know probably

3040
01:56:07,359 --> 01:56:11,039
the

3041
01:56:08,479 --> 01:56:14,718
the all of us who who participate in the

3042
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:18,399
very soul of the cannabis plant

3043
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:19,679
would share this idea of um

3044
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:22,319
you know

3045
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:24,719
embracing

3046
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:27,359
the interaction with spirit and with

3047
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:29,520
nature now and expressing our love in

3048
01:56:27,359 --> 01:56:31,359
ways that

3049
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,320
i don't know nurture and bless the

3050
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:33,118
future

3051
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,679
and

3052
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:38,238
whether no matter the words that we use

3053
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:40,880
to express that idea

3054
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:44,238
um it can only be good and and i'm

3055
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:46,159
grateful that that biodynamics as uh you

3056
01:56:44,238 --> 01:56:48,319
know as a as a farming philosophy and

3057
01:56:46,158 --> 01:56:50,479
and as i'm learning is more of a

3058
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:53,198
more of a life philosophy as much as a

3059
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:56,718
farming philosophy um

3060
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:58,079
you know it's nice to have some of that

3061
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:00,000
importance

3062
01:56:58,079 --> 01:57:01,599
injected into our

3063
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,319
farming

3064
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:06,639
in a day and age where there are so many

3065
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:09,039
pressures to encourage

3066
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:10,560
farmers to look at their farm as

3067
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:14,079
commodities

3068
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:16,800
and uh and as and as purely as a

3069
01:57:14,079 --> 01:57:18,479
food dispensing device so

3070
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:21,520
so with that i think that uh we will

3071
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:24,399
wrap up for today um thank you so much

3072
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:25,440
to both of you for sharing um your time

3073
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:26,960

3079
01:57:35,198 --> 01:57:42,719
veil and sharing some of the aspects of

3080
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:45,760
of this you know biodynamic spirituality

3081
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:48,560
in your farming which as you said

3082
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,639
is not necessarily invited everywhere

3083
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:52,400
all the time that you talk about farming

3084

3099
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,520
important voice in the regenerative

3100
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,400
cannabis community so i appreciate all

3101
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:30,480
you do

3102
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:32,559
and uh appreciate you taking the time to

3103
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:34,399
invite us on here today right on thank

3104
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:36,639
you both so much

3105
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:40,638
so dear listener if um if you want to

3106
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:41,599
learn more about um biodynamic growing

3107
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:42,960
but

3108
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:47,199
even more so

3109
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:49,279
how these ideals can be expressed um in

3110
01:58:47,198 --> 01:58:52,079
your own cannabis cultivation i

3111
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:53,519
encourage you to follow the radical

3112
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:56,399
herbs

3113
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:59,040
uh instagram and as i mentioned in the

3114
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:00,960
introduction that's radical with a with

3115
01:58:59,039 --> 01:59:04,079
not necessarily the spelling that you

3116
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:07,760
would uh expect so it's radical like uh

3117
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:09,279
like the tap root radical so it's r a d

3118
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:10,560
i c

3119
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:14,479
l e

3120
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:17,679
herbs h e r b s so it's radical herbs on

3121
01:59:14,479 --> 01:59:21,118
instagram and you can follow along with

3122
