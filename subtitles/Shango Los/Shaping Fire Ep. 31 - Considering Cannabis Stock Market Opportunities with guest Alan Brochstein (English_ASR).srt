2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,039
the stock market is a moody beast no

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,509
matter how much insight you have or how

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,369
many Fibonacci lines you draw on your

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,080
charts there are still innumerable

6
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,149
pitfalls that can cross your path and

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,129
ruin your trade the risks involved

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,198
skyrocket too when you invest in a

9
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,028
nascent industry like cannabis the

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,710
rapidly changing market lack of

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:26,730
historical data and of course federal

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,679
cannabis prohibition

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,199
I'll make investing in cannabis unlike

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,700
investing in any other industry if you

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,410

welcome to the show Alan hey thanks for

having me it's always great to speak

52

with you and I'm looking forward to

53
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:45,750
addressing your audience fabulous well

54
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,060
I'm glad that you could set aside the

55
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,599
time for us so you know at the heart of

56
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,719
investing is the weighing of risk versus

57
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,239
reward and in an explosive industry like

58
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,129
ours with so many variables moving at

59
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,589
the same time how do you recommend

60
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,780
investors approached determining how

61
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,090
much risk they are comfortable with

62
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,890
yeah that's risk is what it's all about

63
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,098
Shingo so I'm glad you started with that

64
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,050
when I showed up on the scene in 2013

65
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,269
I saw a lot of risk in Apps

66
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,770
no opportunity at least in the public

67
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,890
markets which is where I was initially

68
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,020
focused and even today I like to remind

69
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:26,199
people that this is all federally

70
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,719
illegal so in my community at 420

71
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,009
investor I'm in the middle of a survey

72
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,109
right now that I'm about to close out

73
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:34,799
and a lot of the people have seventy

74
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,240
five to a hundred percent of their

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,300
portfolio invested in cannabis stocks

76
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,270
I think that's insane so I try to remind

77
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,670
people of a couple of things number one

78
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,100
federally legality number two most of

79
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,659
the publicly traded stocks are on the

80
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,849
over-the-counter which is a whole

81
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:54,280
different can of worms it has nothing to

82
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:57,219
do with cannabis it just has to do with

83
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,830
penny stock fraud which is rampant so I

84
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,840
do like people to keep that in mind and

85
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,890
at the same time I like to point people

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,789
to Canada where that federal

87
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:11,829
illegalities --nt the same issue so so

88
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,120
flush that out a little bit so what what

89
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,860
is different about the approach in

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,370
Canada versus how it is here

91
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:21,030
oh sure so yeah some people may not

92
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,800
realize but Canada has a federally legal

93
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,500
medical cannabis program and that's been

94
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,439
around it launched officially in 2014 it

95
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,889
was the second version they had one that

96
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:36,009
launched I think in 2001 and so they're

97
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:39,609
on the cusp of being totally federally

98
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:41,469
legal for adult use as well and you know

99
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,050
that that impacts everything and impacts

100
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:45,250
banking taxes everything all these

101
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,140
problems we have in the United States

102
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,270
they don't have to deal with in Canada

103
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:51,009
of course Canada's not as big as the

104
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,350
United States it's almost as big as

105
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:56,829
California I see what you're saying so

106
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:59,049
as far as unpacking one's risk goes you

107
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,440
know anywhere that you invest in a

108
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,989
licensed product market in the US your

109
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:07,599
first you know monster in the room is oh

110
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:10,480
yeah its federal illegal but at least if

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,729
you were to invest in Canadian companies

112
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,619
those companies they may or may not

113
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,500
themselves be a good company but at

114
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,790
least they're not federally illegal

115
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,379
exactly and you know it goes a little

116
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,020
bit deeper than that it just makes it

117
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:24,610
easier to invest in companies that you

118
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,269
know your audience is pie familiar with

119
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,139
280e

120
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:28,750
for instance

121
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:30,939
and you know it's unfortunate but even

122
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,560
companies that operate well they have to

123
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,909
pay sometimes eighty percent marginal

124
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,740
tax rates you just don't have to deal

125
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:37,810
with those kind of problems in Canada

126
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,319
yeah when when when considering

127
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:46,209
investing in companies it's amazing how

128
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:49,900
a typical looking at at profit and

129
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:52,478
margins and and P&amp;L is different because

130
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:54,818
there are line items that are there that

131
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,339
don't appear in traditional companies

132
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:59,020
and there are additional line on items

133
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,728
that you don't find in other businesses

134
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:05,500
just because cannabis is such a unique

135
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:07,449
sector right now yep yeah so so so as

136
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,519
far as the you know the federal

137
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:12,400
regulation aspect of it right I mean

138
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,709
certainly overall we have this umbrella

139
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,478
of investing in US companies are a

140
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:18,519
challenge because they're federally

141
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,310
illegal but then we've got things that

142
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,438
happen on a weekly scale right we've got

143
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,788
you know Jeff Sessions says one thing

144
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,150
this week and then he seems to say

145
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:30,068
something different another week and you

146
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:31,959
know we're back and forth with you know

147
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,310
is it gonna be schedule one schedule two

148
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:39,579
unscheduled and so there seems to be a

149
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:42,278
intentional you know media circus around

150
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:45,008
these things because it all is clickbait

151
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:48,028
on social media and so it all tends to

152
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:50,770
be kind of constantly a fervor of this

153
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:52,718
how do you what you know what do you

154
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:55,870
recommend to your investors and and

155
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:59,649
guide them to to either react or non

156
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,168
react to this kind of intentional you

157
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:04,179
know excitement of investors so this

158
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,859
whole Jeff Sessions thing is definitely

159
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,050
a problem I I think it's like one of

160
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,960
those clouds that you see lingering all

161
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,538
the time and will it actually rain in

162
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,008
last November when the election results

163
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:17,408
were pouring in I was kind of shocked

164
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,718
initially had to see not only that the

165
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:21,098
Senate was gonna go the other way but

166
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:23,050
more importantly that we're gonna have

167
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:24,878
changed an administration and the first

168
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,310
thing I thought of was we are at risk

169
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,860
and so I told my subscribers at

170
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,418
four-twenty investor that we we have a

171
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,250
risk factor doesn't mean anything's

172
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:34,629
gonna happen but it's something that the

173
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,550
markets are gonna have to deal with and

174
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:38,709
it really caused a problem because the

175
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,699
stock prices had run up going into the

176
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:43,329
election and then they

177
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:45,189
back so you know I I don't think Jeff

178
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:48,219
Sessions is actually going to get his

179
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:50,469
wish which is to roll back cannabis

180
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,640
whether it's medical or even adult use

181
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,990
maybe adult use will see the Cole memo

182
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,259
kind of ramped up a little bit so that

183
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,430
there's more of restrictions I could I

184
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,509
could see that but I don't think that

185
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:07,209
would kill the industry so yes this

186
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:09,789
remains a risk factor and something that

187
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:11,769
the media as you mentioned really over

188
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,990
plays and it scares people and it scares

189
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:16,810
the entrepreneurs because if you think

190
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,689
back to 2013 after Washington and

191
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,329
Colorado had voted to legalize in late

192
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:25,240
2012 everybody was sitting around around

193
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:26,529
waiting on the federal government to see

194
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,810
what would happen and they put in place

195
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,459
the Cole memo in August and then all of

196
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,889
a sudden all the entrepreneurs investors

197
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:35,500
were able to move forward in both states

198
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:39,039
and I think it's probably too late to

199
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,019
roll it back there's you have an issue

200
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,910
now where a lot of states are pulling in

201
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:45,789
a lot of tax money there's a lot of

202
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,980
employment in the sector and probably

203
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,010
more importantly Shango that the will of

204
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:54,220
the voters just continues to really

205
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:57,159
point to tolerance for recreational

206
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,170
cannabis in an actual embracement of

207
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,390
medical cannabis I mean we saw that in

208
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:04,390
the Florida elections very conservative

209
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:08,949
state a lot of older people yet they got

210
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:10,779
past the 60% requirement to pass medical

211
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,930
cannabis which was something they were

212
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:17,469
unable to do in the prior election so I

213
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:20,379
think that it's actually the state and

214
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,090
local governments there are more of a

215
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,009
problem for the cannabis industry than

216
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,519
the federal the federal government is

217
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,469
obviously not helping the industry but

218
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,449
it's kind of status quo it's really it's

219
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,830
the municipalities in the states when

220
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,860
we're seeing a lot of problems we saw

221
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,780
that in Ohio a couple weeks ago when

222
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,370
they handed out licenses and there's a

223
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,679
lot of controversy there already we've

224
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,169
seen delays in a lot of states we see a

225
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,000
lot of municipalities pushing back we

226
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,979
see rule changes that can really hurt

227
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,590
these cannabis companies when they all

228
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,180
of a sudden change the rules so you know

229
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,440
you started off time at risk there's so

230
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,629
many different risks and this

231
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,600
this industry so let's talk about a

232
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:01,090
couple other ones so on a company to

233
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,980
company level you know you know in a in

234
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:07,240
an industry like ours that's so

235
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:11,470
fast-paced and for you know the last 50

236
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,350
years has been in the shadows now that

237
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,480
people are able to work on these

238
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,639
products and these technologies and

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,450
these business solutions out in the open

240
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,009
more we get people who are developing

241
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,250
extraction technology technology x' at

242
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:32,169
this at this wicked rate and and and and

243
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:35,019
the technologies are becoming outmoded

244
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:37,990
and being surpassed by new companies at

245
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:40,779
an incredible rate how do you weigh

246
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,029
these these fast-paced technologies and

247
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,069
solutions becoming outmoded so quickly

248
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,850
when you're trying to decide whether or

249
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,620
not a company's got long term viability

250
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,870
ya know I'm I'm actually really excited

251
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,460
about this because this is one of things

252
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,440
I mentioned it's really one of the best

253
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:01,060
things about our industry that we we

254
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,490
have time in incentives for people to

255
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,529
make big changes and I guess you're

256
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,930
looking at it as a threat the reality is

257
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,730
most of the cannabis stocks that have

258
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:11,319
been trained over the last few years are

259
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,600
really not real and we haven't really

260
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,270
addressed that yet so it's not so much a

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,980
risk for cannabis investors is an

262
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,860
opportunity I'd love to see some of

263
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,960
these innovative companies move into the

264
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,399
public sector they're not really there

265
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,629
yet so for the most part you're talking

266
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,490
about in the private investment world

267
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:29,950
where we're seeing a lot of companies do

268
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,399
neat things we're seeing companies jump

269
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:36,220
from basically where they'll have a

270
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,189
product developed for let's just call it

271
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,180
a regular industry and then they adapt

272
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,820
that product and we're talking about

273
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,949
like POS systems for instance but it

274
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,570
goes a lot deeper and the thing that I

275
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,900
really focus on and I'm not seeing it

276
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,690
yet in the public markets but we're

277
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:56,289
getting close and that is technology

278
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:58,690
that will enable us to have cannabis

279
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:00,009
beverages rapid-acting it doesn't have

280
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:06,730
to be necessarily beverages but

281
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:08,159
rapid-acting cannabis edibles that

282
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,950
really get around one of the worst

283
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,199
aspects of edibles which is that you

284
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,240
know the onset so slow the people tend

285
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,700
to overdo it sometimes and really cuts

286
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,590
down on social nice I saw just today

287
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:28,750
shellene title has been able to pull off

288
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:31,960
in Massachusetts the ability to have

289
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,879
social use which is something we haven't

290
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,740
really seen in any market yet

291
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:39,549
certainly not in Colorado the original

292
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,080
legal market I think to get on parity

293
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:43,419
with the alcohol industry that's going

294
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,000
to be essential so that's what I'm

295
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,740
looking for and like I say it's more of

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,769
an opportunity than really a risk I

297
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,289
don't think anybody's gonna lose by the

298
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:56,049
way no markets changing I mean flower is

299
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:58,929
still very popular it runs at about 50%

300
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,819
in your state still and in most states

301
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:04,259
but we're seeing all these other really

302
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,720
neat forms of delivery and innovation

303
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:10,659
and in terms of the modes of ingestion

304
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,300
or consumption when an investor is

305
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:15,009
looking at a company and considering

306
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,589
investing you know there's so many

307
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:19,299
unproven executives in cannabis it

308
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,540
reminds me of the first dot-com boom

309
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:25,149
where you'd have a visionary who had

310
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:27,490
some kind of access to capital and so

311
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:29,889
they started from nothing and they may

312
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:32,529
have been you know a middle manager or

313
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,330
less at some company beforehand but

314
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:36,370
they're just somebody with moxie and

315
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,950
access to some capital and off they went

316
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,500
you know building building their dot-com

317
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,840
and the majority of them failed from

318
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,450
either running out of cash or just from

319
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,019
poor management or both you know how do

320
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,560
you weigh for yourself this is the fact

321
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:55,500
that there are so many inexperienced

322
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,839
managers who are running these companies

323
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,379
ya know that's a good point and so I a

324
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,050
few years ago I started sharing my 3p

325
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:06,939
analysis of companies and I think

326
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:09,490
investors really fall for one of the P's

327
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,750
the first P is the plan I don't usually

328
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,580
say that first of all I'm gonna say it

329
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,779
to you first you know what is what is it

330
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,590
that they're trying to do what's their

331
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:18,699
plan and then the second P is the people

332
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,560
and that's kind of what you're asking

333
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,028
about and then the third one that you

334
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,489
alluded to as well I called the

335
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:26,528
pecuniary because that is a P instead of

336
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,620
money or it could be the P P and the M

337
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:31,840
but so what I try to tell people is

338
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,299
don't get caught up on the plan first of

339
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,740
all I mean plans are pretty easy and so

340
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,838
then you you look at the people it's

341
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,110
very important because you're right I

342
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,760
mean even for myself I'm not the best

343
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,259
stock analyst in the world I was just

344
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,179
the only one crazy enough to show up

345
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,269
here in 2013 which gave me a running

346
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:51,459
head start in in the same way you know

347
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:52,929
people were either smart or stupid but

348
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,810
they came into this industry because

349
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:58,209
they saw an opportunity and you know

350
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:00,278
there's a lot of stigma and that keeps

351
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:03,730
people out I'm seeing huge changes on

352
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:06,129
that front over the last 6 to 12 months

353
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,289
where we're seeing just a rapid influx

354
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,299
of really qualified people and that's

355
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:13,000
that's a good thing for the industry but

356
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:14,709
it's gonna get to the point where like

357
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,299
you said some of these people that were

358
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,278
here a couple years ago they're not

359
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:21,370
really qualified to lead the industry

360
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:23,470
necessarily so and then on the money

361
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,810
part I think it's important because you

362
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,149
know people that were paying attention

363
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:31,169
in the dot-com could have seen the cash

364
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:34,199
burns and lack of tangible results and

365
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:37,029
figured out that that wasn't gonna work

366
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,920
one thing I run into all the time when

367
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:41,379
interviewing folks and then just doing

368
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:44,110
my own research on companies are the two

369
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,269
different kinds of leaders that they

370
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,600
tend to have on one side you've got

371
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,639
companies that are led by by folks who

372
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
have their life experience in

373
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,259
prohibition area era yeah so they are

374
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,449
their cannabis people first and foremost

375
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,730
they were in the shadows when it when it

376
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,960
became more normalized they've come out

377
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,209
of the shadows and now they're running

378
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,400
their company but because they were

379
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,439
doing black market business for all

380
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,990
these years they don't have a lot of the

381
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,320
traditional skills that you'd get at a

382
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,089
you know fully legal corporation now on

383
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,010
the flip side you've got all these new

384
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,200
people coming into the industry that

385
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:22,208
have little to no cannabis experience

386
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,570
except for maybe toking in themselves

387
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:27,669
but they have worked at you know blue

388
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,100
chip companies and they they know how to

389
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:32,199
read a P&amp;L and they're used to working

390
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,420
with venture capital and so they've got

391
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,850
that side but then they don't know what

392
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:38,500
ask a master grower when they go to hire

393
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,778
them because I don't actually they're

394
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,350
not from inside the industry so so how

395
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:45,909
do you see those two sets of people you

396
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,339
know how do you weigh between the two of

397
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:49,958
those when you're considering investing

398
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,120
yeah this is a great question and it's

399
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,708
something I point to a lot I'm flashing

400
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,269
back to the one and only

401
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:59,888
MJ bisque on I went to in 2014 I go to

402
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:02,919
other conferences but I don't like big

403
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:05,259
crowds and I remember kind of looking at

404
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,778
the it was such a divergent group of

405
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:09,519
people you had like you said the suits

406
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:11,439
and then the people that knew what they

407
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,399
were doing but not necessarily so

408
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,750
business savvy in the real world and and

409
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,980
thankfully I've noticed I haven't been

410
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,600
back to that conference but at other

411
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,289
conferences I've noticed it's getting

412
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,610
bridged and what I try to counsel

413
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:26,708
anybody he'll listen to me is look for

414
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,360
the management teams that they don't

415
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,698
necessarily have to have the Cannabis

416
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,289
expertise that's always I think it's

417
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:35,349
good to have somebody on the team that

418
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:36,879
really has it but you can get that on an

419
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,620
outsourced basis by having good

420
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,860
consultants you just want to make sure

421
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,409
that the suits running the company are

422
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,810
grounded in the reality of the industry

423
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:49,480
and at the same time it's very possible

424
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:51,909
that you could have people that are

425
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,320
emerging from the black market they'd

426
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:55,990
never have the felony or there it's

427
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,149
going to be hard to do but they don't

428
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,649
have the management savvy on their team

429
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,089
but they have good counselors so it's

430
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:02,289
it's you don't necessarily have to have

431
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,620
those people but I really like to see

432
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:06,849
management teams that have been able to

433
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,229
where the where the two sides have been

434
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:10,659
able to come together and appreciate

435
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,849
that if they want to really accomplish a

436
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,779
lot they're gonna have to draw from both

437
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:19,448
those wells and work together and that

438
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:21,970
they've internally resolved that and can

439
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:24,490
show that unified presence to their

440
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:27,400
investors or customers or whatever it is

441
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,679
I think you're really spot-on to mention

442
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,320
consultants because even though you know

443
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,540
a cannabis consultant air quotes is kind

444
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,308
of a running joke right yes yeah because

445
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,339
you know you can't go to a convention

446
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:41,649
without bumping into you know hundreds

447
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:44,589
of cannabis consultants but at the same

448
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:47,298
time you're right you can you can

449
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:50,720
third-party those types of skills

450
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:52,788
which makes the skill that the to the

451
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,429
suit to use your words they don't

452
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:57,798
necessarily need to know how to set up

453
00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:00,559
an extraction lab but they have to be

454
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:02,989
really good with their Human Resources

455
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,178
approach to know how to find the right

456
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:08,239
kind of person who actually knows how to

457
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:10,278
set up a lab and in the in these early

458
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:12,048
days I would say that we're finding more

459
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:14,269
people who have hired the wrong people

460
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:16,489
and have got a fall out of that

461
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:18,259
relationship and they have more success

462
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:20,028
with their second or third person

463
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:22,399
because they're actually having to learn

464
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:23,778
from their mistakes that's for sure and

465
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:26,689
I hear about you know we're on our

466
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:28,700
fourth master grower kind of discussion

467
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,528
all the time and we're talking I Canada

468
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,450
earlier this is even up there they have

469
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:34,999
the same problem and maybe it's even

470
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:39,830
worse it's but it really hits home and I

471
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:42,739
always try to look I don't have a horse

472
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:45,108
in this race really I'm you know I'm

473
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:49,129
kind of an observer and the analyst I'm

474
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:52,220
not in the industry so I I have a lot of

475
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:55,658
sympathy and for the people who fought

476
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,100
the battle to get us to where we are and

477
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:59,389
it really pains me when I see like

478
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,980
what's going on in California a lot of

479
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,258
these people are going to really not be

480
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,298
in the industry unfortunately and you

481
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:08,058
know Oregon was a good state they've let

482
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:09,558
people even with felonies participate in

483
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:11,418
the industry but most states don't do

484
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:15,499
that but up in Canada they have the

485
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:17,499
exact same problem with the people that

486
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:21,980
have been operating the gray market

487
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:23,808
they're disenfranchised and so I've

488
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,038
noticed you know some of the companies

489
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:30,678
have figured this out and have tried to

490
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:33,319
bring them in and just recently the

491
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,379
Federal Government of Canada proposed

492
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:38,388
kind of a second tier producer called a

493
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:41,988
micro cultivator I guess like a craft

494
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:44,479
cultivator which from my understanding

495
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:47,298
this is an attempt to broaden the

496
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,788
industry because if it's gonna make the

497
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:51,319
industry better you you want to kill off

498
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:53,749
the black market you don't want to push

499
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:55,668
the people with all the expertise out

500
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:57,230
and make them compete with you in the

501
00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:00,830
black market that's not good for society

502
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,539
so there's a lot we can unpack the

503
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:04,039
yeah totally well that's exactly what

504
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:06,559
happened here in Washington right yeah

505
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,389
instead of blessing the medical medical

506
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,980
yeah medical just got straight killed

507
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,170
and they gave the licenses to all the

508
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,470
newcomers so now we've got this this

509
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,509
highly integrated networked black market

510
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:21,110
that also happens to have incredible

511
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:23,420
technology co2 extractors and great labs

512
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:25,879
competing with the state and so it's

513
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,289
it's ugly so so in this in this first

514
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,160
section of the show we've talked a lot

515
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:33,740
about some of the unique and ugly risks

516
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,110
that investors have to consider when

517
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,170
when looking at these new companies and

518
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:42,619
and you know it's it's enough to cause

519
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:45,019
people to just say man forget investing

520
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:47,359
in cannabis it's it's it's too noisy

521
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:49,609
it's not a safe place for my money I'll

522
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,779
put it somewhere else that's got less of

523
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:55,429
these risks when when you hear people

524
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:57,410
who are kind of looking for a reason

525
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:00,080
because they want to invest in cannabis

526
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,550
but they also see these risks is there

527
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,679
anything that you can tell them to kind

528
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:07,430
of soothe them to like hey you know keep

529
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,799
looking in cannabis yeah so I've been

530
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:12,650
you know I I've been warning about these

531
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:14,389
risks for a long time and it was really

532
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,810
an inflection point in my cannabis

533
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:20,330
career when the local CFA or Chartered

534
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:24,619
Financial Analysts Society asked me to

535
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:26,990
speak in April and not I I wouldn't have

536
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:30,099
done it until this year and I feel like

537
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,960
the industry the investment set has

538
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:34,519
definitely improved the risks are still

539
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,860
there I think they've gone down and

540
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:40,129
they're better understood now and and

541
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:44,119
what I tell people in the 420 investor

542
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:45,920
community is mitigate the risk don't put

543
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,319
all your money into the industry put a

544
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,590
little bit don't put it all into one

545
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,509
stock spread it around you know I'd give

546
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:57,379
the same device to any private investors

547
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:59,359
were they to ask just in terms of you

548
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,820
know making sure you don't have too much

549
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,679
exposure to any one situation because

550
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:05,869
you just the fact that it's a new

551
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,610
industry you should be careful it's a

552
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:10,879
venture capital type of approach just

553
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:12,259
you know if you have make 10 investments

554
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,210
and one of them is a 10 bag or it

555
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:17,210
doesn't matter what happens with

556
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:21,650
with the rest really so that that's kind

557
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:24,740
of what I try to tell them to to be

558
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,720
diversified into not well that's mainly

559
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,099
it diversification shingles yeah right

560
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,150
on that makes a lot of sense so we're

561
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:31,129
gonna take a short break and be right

562

602
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,049
canikin org while I certainly still

603
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,089
enjoy smoking joints I moved over to

604
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,829
using vaporizers about three years ago

605
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:08,480
the high was a little different than

606
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:10,449
burning the flower and in the end I

607
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,130
decided I preferred it for daily use

608
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,900
especially because I have asthma more

609
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,570
importantly though I could taste my

610
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,280
flower so much more it's hard to express

611
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:21,169
to you how significantly different

612
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,019
cannabis with a good terpene profile

613
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,789
tastes when vaped instead of burned I

614
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:27,619
have brought my vape with me to visit

615
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:29,329
growers and they are astonished by the

616
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:30,619
clarity of taste and they say they feel

617
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:33,109
like they're tasting their flower for

618
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:35,808
the very first time the air vape

619
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:38,299
vaporizer from air vape usa.com is a

620
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:40,609
great device to use on the go or at home

621
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:41,599
when you pick it up and feel satisfying

622
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,729
like a medical device

623
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,949
it isn't flimsy like many vapes are I

624
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,049
like how the flower is inserted in the

625
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,000
top instead of the bottom so travels are

626
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:51,589
shorter path to my mouth with the

627
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,390
cannabis at the top I get a hit that

628
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:55,339
feels more substantial even though I'm

629
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,950
just inhaling vapor and not full bodied

630
00:24:55,339 --> 00:25:00,259
smoke since I used this vape for flower

631
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,819
hash and concentrates I really like that

632
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:03,980
that digital control for the temperature

633
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:05,389
is right there on the front three clicks

634
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,370
of the button and it fires up to the

635
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,950
temperature I specify really quickly and

636
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:12,379
discreetly you know vape concentrates

637
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,880
are a milder experience than dabbing but

638
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,160
you still get the potency in your hit

639
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,860
also the taste is great as would be

640
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,808
expected with a low temp tab I love that

641
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:21,799
this vape gives quick little vibrations

642
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:24,410
when it gets to the right temperature

643
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:25,879
that way if I'm chatting or distracted

644
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,308
while it's heating up it lets me know

645
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,890
when it's ready if you are ready for a

646
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:33,649

00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,439
first set we talked a lot about the high

657
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,639
risks that are involved with investing

658
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,340
in these cannabis companies and the

659
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,410
importance of being diversified and you

660
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:03,259
know most everybody is getting their

661
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,179
information about these companies on the

662
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,519
internet and these you know most Lee's

663
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:10,009
canvassed companies are so obscure and a

664
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:13,339
lot of the news about them seems somehow

665
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:15,259
canned and prepared how should folks

666
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:17,389
interested in cannabis investing go

667
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:19,789
about starting their research into their

668
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,320
target companies yeah that's a good

669
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:24,049
question I mean this led me to start a

670
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:29,269
new business because I was running a 420

671
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:32,808
investor from late 2013 into 2015 and

672
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:34,339
just really scratching my head about the

673
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:35,599
bigger industry instead of just the

674
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:38,779
public stocks we're talking about the

675
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,759
whole industry and one of the things I

676
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:41,319
was known for at 420 investor was being

677
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:44,158
a really good

678
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:47,829
filter and there's so much noise and

679
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,139
people wanted to get information on the

680
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:52,839
good companies only not all the noise

681
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:54,788
out there and that's really what I was

682
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,528
trying to do a 420 investment so we

683
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:59,379
started a new cannabis ventures in

684
00:26:56,528 --> 00:27:01,509
September of 2015 with that goal to kind

685
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,820
of focus on just the really good

686
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:05,380
companies and the really good investors

687
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:08,888
because there's a lot of fake investors

688
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,929
to which we can talk about so it is hard

689
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:13,000
to find news and I think your listeners

690
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,000
deserve to know that there's you know

691
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,888
that whole concept of fake news is

692
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,628
supreme in the cannabis industry in them

693
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,939
in the public stocks especially but I've

694
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:23,859
seen it even in private companies in

695
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,269
these press releases will know we don't

696
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:26,740
have operations today but we're gonna

697
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,589
have a hundred million in revenue and

698
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,440
next year that type of thing so there is

699
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:34,298
a lot out there you know I wish I could

700
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,340
tell your listeners of all the different

701
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:38,440
places there's some great content

702
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:41,109
creators out there I guess they're kind

703
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,490
of competitors of mine that new cameras

704
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:44,769
of interest we we definitely have an

705
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,528
investor audience but we get a lot of

706
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:49,808
operators as well cannabis business

707
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:53,679
times I think does a great job they have

708
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:56,259
a cultivation focus but they have real

709
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,669
news you know MJ business daily has

710
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:01,028
really stepped it up

711
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:03,190
they have journalists on staff they've

712
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:05,109
widened their their content so I think

713
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:07,389
that's a good place for people to get

714
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:09,339
information from cannabis industry

715
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:12,398
Journal there's some good podcasters

716
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:14,859
besides you I include you in the list

717
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,508
but there's some others as well we don't

718
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:19,269
have to name them all but I think it's

719
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:21,429
important to really understand kind of

720
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:23,798
what the source of the news is because

721
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:25,750
if it's just being paid for and it's not

722
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:27,788
really earned it's not really that real

723
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,619
and there's a lot of that going on yeah

724
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:32,138
one of those sources that I like that

725
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:35,018
that does not overly pump things up is

726
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:37,599
Alex Halperin over at weed week yeah

727
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:39,819
yeah his curation is really nice and he

728
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,519
doesn't add drama to things but you know

729
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:44,888
that was originally what attracted me to

730
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,720
to your new cannabis ventures because I

731
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:49,418
think you do a really good job curating

732
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,129
as well and you know your your intent

733
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:53,570
when you curate is different than a lot

734
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:56,418
of other sources a lot of other sources

735
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:58,189
they're they're curating because they

736
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:00,049
want clicks and they want right people

737
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,879
to comment and they want the drama and

738
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:03,528
the sharing and the arguing and all that

739
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:05,329
kind of stuff but that's not your goal

740
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:08,388
your goal you started new cannabis

741
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:11,148
ventures to be of service to the

742
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:14,418
investors in your 420 investors

743
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:16,219
community right and so so instead of

744
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:19,278
just trying to get the clicks you're

745
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,899
trying to create a base so that people

746
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,608
have got good information in the

747
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:24,219
community you run and I think that

748
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:26,269
that's a really important delineation

749
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,519
yeah well it's not just in that

750
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:31,489
community it's it's broader and it's

751
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:33,108
really extending from that but are you

752
00:29:31,489 --> 00:29:34,519
know so we have just so people

753
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:36,048
understand our business model we're very

754
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:37,819
transparent and go to our site and see

755
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:39,710
exactly who our advertisers are and

756
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:41,450
there's no doubt we run our advertisers

757
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,788
and news we don't we don't share our

758
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:47,179
views like I would never say you should

759
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:49,669
invest in my advertiser but we run the

760
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:53,028
news of their competitors - it's very I

761
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:56,330
always tell our advertisers our readers

762
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:57,589
are the most important thing to us we if

763
00:29:56,329 --> 00:30:00,138
we don't have our readers we don't have

764
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:02,118
a business and and we've earned the

765
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:06,228
trust of our readers for two reasons

766
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:10,999
number one that we've been very very

767
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:12,259
much a filter we we don't we will report

768
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:15,319
on like I've written some pretty

769
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:16,519
negative stories about poseurs I'm well

770
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,038
known for that that's really a second

771
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,079
point so they people can count on us if

772
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,940
it's important news we're gonna publish

773
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:24,528
it and that's the first thing but they

774
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,999
can also count on us to really call

775
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:27,440
people out and when I do go to

776
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:29,389
conferences people will come up to me

777
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,028
Shengo and they'll say you know I got to

778
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:34,219
tell you I love the way you're willing

779
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:35,989
to call these jokers out and so

780
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,450
fortunately I don't have to do that that

781
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:40,999
much but it's actually kind of enjoy it

782
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,759
it's it's a weird thing in our society

783
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:46,278
that you can make a lot of money saying

784
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,798
good things about people there's a lot

785
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:51,108
to that at the same time if you want to

786
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:51,769
say bad things about people you run a

787
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:53,298
big risk

788
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:55,638
I was sued for a hundred million dollars

789
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:59,418
back in 2013 by a company that's now

790
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:02,058
bankrupt and it literally they called

791
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:04,519
this libel I cut and pasted their SEC

792
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:05,960
filings and they didn't like that and

793
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:07,180
they sued me and anybody can sue anybody

794
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,079
for anything

795
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,940
so you know I had to absorb the expense

796
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,799
of getting that eliminated but it was a

797
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,700
big you know I was scared 100 million

798
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:21,159
dollars a lot of money but for me so you

799
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:25,539
know in cannabis cannabis is drawing out

800
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:27,460
a lot of first-time investors and we had

801
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:29,079
yes you know people who have maybe maybe

802
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,610
they've talked their whole life and this

803
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:32,649
is the time that they've always hoped

804
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:35,500
would happen and and they want to get

805
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:38,380
involved or or people who were around

806
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,809
for Google going public everybody's like

807
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,850
oh if I if I only would have invested in

808
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:44,500
Google a heck a lot of my friends are

809
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:47,439
doing that right now around Bitcoin you

810
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,049
know and so so there's a lot of new

811
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,000
investors and and I'd love for you to

812
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:54,369
kind of just briefly explain for folks

813
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,859
just to help them be aware of this kind

814
00:31:54,369 --> 00:32:02,709
of news about the the habit of I guess

815
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:05,889
we'll call it fake new sources pumping

816
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:08,470
up a company or a stock to elicit

817
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,330
excitement and then whoever's behind the

818
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,829
play then dumping it could you kind of

819
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:13,389
just explain that dynamic a little bit

820
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:17,019
so that people can read with a little

821
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:19,270
more skepticism oh yeah and I love where

822
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:21,819
you're coming from and you're spot-on

823
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:24,220
there are so many people of all ages

824
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:26,500
that are showing up and you know this

825
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,539
started not not recently it started back

826
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,130
in 13 but it's still happening with

827
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:32,859
California about to legalize I'm seeing

828
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,330
it again and I think this is what people

829
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:36,339
don't understand about the OTC I

830
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,960
mentioned it earlier has nothing to do

831
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:39,659
with the cannabis industry this problem

832
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,170
that I'm about to tell you it's just

833
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:46,210
human nature and snake oil salesmen and

834
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:49,210
all that and so anytime something's hot

835
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:51,220
like Bitcoin right now it draws in the

836
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:53,380
scammers and the cannabis industry has

837
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,420
drawn in fake cannabis companies this

838
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,890
has been going on for years now I like

839
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,960
to point to the positive that there's a

840
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,870
lot more real companies now but it's

841
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,019
undoubtedly true that there's a ton of

842
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:07,089
posers out there and the people behind

843
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:09,039
these companies this is what a lot of

844
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:12,309
people don't understand the finance

845
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,250
seers they they get free blocks of stock

846
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:17,980
or very cheap blocks of stock and

847
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,289
they'll pay for news to go out there and

848
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,980
it sounds great and people see this and

849
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,279
they don't under

850
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:27,910
stand that it's not real and so it

851
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:29,829
causes a temporary blip in the price of

852
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,230
the stock and the volume and it allows

853
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:34,779
these scammers to unload their shares

854
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,089
and honestly I wish I really understood

855
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:39,220
it all the SEC is overworked I know if

856
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:42,069
they had more money and more power they

857
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,870
would not allow this to happen but it's

858
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:45,849
unfortunate there are companies that

859
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:47,649
don't even file with the SEC which I

860
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:50,428
can't even believe that that's legal and

861
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:55,240
they file on what's called OTC markets

862
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:57,330
and in even some of the SEC filing

863
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,700
companies they do things that are just

864
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:03,240
should be illegal yet it goes on and

865
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,558
some of these things would include like

866
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,210
you know we read about it after the fact

867
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:10,659
unfortunately where the SEC

868
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:12,579
enforces action and you have to wonder

869
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,809
how many of these do they not catch but

870
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:15,730
they'll put out a press release how they

871
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:17,378
caught these people with these illegal

872
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,599
offshore accounts and they were doing

873
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:22,239
this and doing that guess what this goes

874
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,819
on every day and that's the unfortunate

875
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,918
part about the cannabis market being on

876
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,800
what's called the over the counter or

877
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:31,779
OTC most of these stocks don't trade on

878
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,039
the New York Stock Exchange or the

879
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,899
Nasdaq there's a few exceptions and so

880
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,329
it's it's very unfortunate and it leaves

881
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:42,388
people with a really bad taste in their

882
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:45,159
mouth because they're excited about

883
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:48,669
investing in the cannabis industry but

884
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,619
they go in with their eyes wide open and

885
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:51,908
they get taken advantage of and then

886
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:53,710
they think there's something wrong with

887
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,898
cannabis or something you know to that

888
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,639
effect and it's really a structural

889
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:59,940
problem not related to the cannabis

890
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:03,190
industry but related to over-the-counter

891
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:06,130
certainly the idea of pump and dump is

892
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:08,230
is way easier to do thanks to social

893
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,420
media right because oh my gosh yes so

894
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,760
much more difficult but now if you

895
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,159
coordinate two or three media sources

896
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,170
and you put out a tasty bit of news and

897
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:19,629
suggest that everyone's buying it and

898
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,280
and then you buy a big chunk yourself so

899
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:24,220
that the stock goes up a little bit and

900
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,560
then at which somehow proves to people

901
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:29,259
that that the news that they're reading

902
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,690
is true so now all these the second wave

903
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,060
investors jump in and now it's really

904
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,510
going up which then really doubly proves

905
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:36,460
that

906
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,010
that media source is true and then as

907
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,170
soon as it hits the target level for for

908
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:43,780
the people behind this misinformation

909
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:46,090
they dump all of their stock the prices

910
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,310
crashes and then and then all of these

911
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:51,519
first-time investors and and even you

912
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:54,159
know pros they their money just

913
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,659
vaporizes you sound like you know what's

914
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:59,109
going on here you sure you're not a pump

915
00:35:55,659 --> 00:36:00,789
and dump er yourself I'm just a nerd and

916
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:03,610
I did the doctor it was really common

917
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:06,309
then - yeah no you're right and the

918
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,720
social media part for sure we see all

919
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:12,369
sorts of Twitter BOTS

920
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:14,829
I mean I've my partner has actually

921
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:16,719
researched some of the names that we've

922
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:18,940
written on and we'll see we're able to

923
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,639
prove that there's fake BOTS out there

924
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,820
pushing saying good things about the

925
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:26,409
company on Twitter it's very easy to set

926
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,900
up an Instagram account and show pretty

927
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:30,399
pictures of Budd I mean there's if

928
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,769
there's all these things that can really

929
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,740
play to that psychology of making

930
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:38,670
something fake look real yeah that's for

931
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:41,139
sure so so let's talk about you know

932
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:43,090
informal information that happens to you

933
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:46,480
know one thing that I run into all the

934
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:49,539
time being in media and being at

935
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,719
conventions you know the listening to

936
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:54,969
shaping fire listening to a podcast

937
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,679
through your earbuds as many people do

938
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:58,689
is a pretty intimate experience right I

939
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:00,669
have access I'm in there I'm in their

940
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,159
ear and we're talking you know you know

941
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:05,500
usually weekly and so a lot of these

942
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,409
executives they take me aside at events

943
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,469
and they they tell me things right they

944
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:13,149
they're excited about this this merger

945
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:14,649
that's about to happen or this company

946
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,320
they're about to acquire this new

947
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:19,300
technology that's coming out and they're

948
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,070
they're bursting and they just want

949
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,170
somebody who they feel is going to

950
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:26,230
appreciate it with them because they're

951
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:28,210
excited and so they tell me or they are

952
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,240
they tell an associate of mine and now

953
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:34,179
suddenly we know information that's not

954
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:36,879
publicly available and this is happening

955
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:39,519
all the time especially with executives

956
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,349
who are new to playing at this level

957
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,909
they're used to talking you know just

958
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:44,949
talking with their friends over beers or

959
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:47,389
whatever and now they're playing with

960
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:50,989
you know seven figures or more

961
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:55,309
of valuation and so you know where is

962
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:58,519
this line between you know being a smart

963
00:37:55,309 --> 00:38:00,340
investor and asking questions that other

964
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:03,469
people aren't asking so you can unearth

965
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:05,539
valuable information versus straight-up

966
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:09,019
insider trading where you could get in

967
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:11,659
some trouble yeah you know I I'm very

968
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:13,070
sensitive to that I your audience

969
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:14,899
doesn't notice I don't invest in the

970
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,960
cannabis industry and this is one of the

971
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:21,470
reasons why I don't because I don't want

972
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,720
to be in that position of of crossing

973
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:27,049
that line most of the people I speak

974
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,279
with they tend to be in the public

975
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,130
market so they're gonna be very careful

976
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,220
about that anyway but you know they're

977
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:37,400
very careful in general with me so I

978
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:39,289
don't really get that crossing of the

979
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,930
line and saying things this should be

980
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:46,880
disclosed publicly but aren't but I'm

981
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:49,099
sure it happens and III mean to me

982
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,559
that's a big risk we have clients as I

983
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:53,599
mentioned and you know they sometimes

984
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:57,019
want me to they want to give me

985
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,730
information and sign an NDA I'm like why

986
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:59,239
I don't want to know anything that's not

987
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,760
public

988
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:04,459
I really don't so I tried to protect

989
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,310
myself and them by not accepting

990
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,389
confidential information so but I can

991
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:10,849
see how that's a problem

992
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:12,650
yeah actually that that lack of

993
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,210
willingness to sign an NDA is a really

994
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,309
interesting aspect I'm have to chew on

995
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,720
that a little bit yeah I don't want

996
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:21,199
privileged information I really don't

997
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:22,609
I'm not investing and you know

998
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,469
especially with a public company that's

999
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,059
just that's a huge risk I mean you read

1000
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:29,029
about this all the time these people

1001
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:30,949
getting busted for insider trading I'm

1002
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,650
not gonna be one of those people right

1003
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:36,769
on so so so let's talk about companies

1004
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:39,200
that are on the far side of maybe not a

1005
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:41,210
pump and dub but but are on the far side

1006
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,159
of the media's excitement about them

1007
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,349
right so so I'm into some cannabis

1008
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:47,690
companies I that I bought you know stock

1009
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:50,360
in early on and and you know they got up

1010
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,740
to a couple bucks few bucks and then and

1011
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,920
then they're there you know maybe they

1012
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:57,019
lost a CEO or or their product didn't

1013
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,510
get adopted as fast or like we were

1014
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:01,170
talking about earlier their their local

1015
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,119
laws change

1016
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,940
there's a moratorium or something just

1017
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,260
mess them up right and so so so they got

1018
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,960
up to a few bucks and now they're just

1019
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,000
kind of languishing at you know 30 or 50

1020
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,730
cents something like that what are the

1021
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,619
kinds of things that you know if the

1022
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:19,710
companies is going to have a rebound

1023
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:21,390
these are these are stocks that are on

1024
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,548
sale right these are these are things

1025
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:27,389
that you can get at a low price so long

1026
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:30,139
as they eventually go up so so from on

1027
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:34,019
the Investor side what kinds of things

1028
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:36,568
can happen for these companies that were

1029
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:40,730
up and now they're down that actually

1030
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:44,670
can revitalize and and be seen as a

1031
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:47,818
value stock that's undervalued yep well

1032
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,980
so let me warn everybody because we're I

1033
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:53,489
think in the middle of our third big

1034
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:56,519
rally since 2013 the first one around

1035
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:58,588
Colorado the second one in advance of

1036
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:00,269
the elections last year and so this

1037
00:40:58,588 --> 00:41:01,199
one's in advance of California it's

1038
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:03,269
something I've been talking about for a

1039
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,710
while but I always like to point out to

1040
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:06,539
people and I've even been writing about

1041
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:09,750
this like I think I post this with no

1042
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:12,900
LinkedIn did you know that that historic

1043
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:15,088
rally in 2014 when Colorado legalized

1044
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,318
there weren't that many stocks and there

1045
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:18,539
were a lot of people you were talking

1046
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,699
about the excitement earlier so I'm you

1047
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:23,429
know imagine everybody's trying to to

1048
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:26,699
get into the arena right in time you

1049
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:29,250
know the lines long to get in and so

1050
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:32,818
that pushed prices way high so you had a

1051
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:35,159
lot of some of the early stocks that

1052
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:37,170
went to prices that really made no sense

1053
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,629
and that weren't sustainable so I would

1054
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,280
caution investors just in general to

1055
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,640
understand that there are a lot more

1056
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,500
stocks I tracked maybe 20 stocks at the

1057
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,779
beginning of 2014 that were cannabis

1058
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,048
related now I'm at 600 some of those are

1059
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,900
Canadian so you have a lot more stocks

1060
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:58,139
and just a little bit more subtle point

1061
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:00,389
many of those stocks back then the

1062
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:02,129
insiders held like 90 percent of the

1063
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:04,108
shares and so there was just a small

1064
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:07,289
amount that was in the public float and

1065
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:08,818
that created an artificial mechanism

1066
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:11,699
that really forced those stocks to

1067
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:13,380
really unsustainable levels because if

1068
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:14,759
you factor in the other 90 percent that

1069
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,170
weren't trading the

1070
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,720
stocks couldn't have gotten to where

1071
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:21,329
they got so that that's the first thing

1072
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,609
so look I told you the industry in my

1073
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:25,920
view has really improved and we started

1074
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:28,410
at new cannabis ventures tracking the

1075
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,960
companies that have ten million dollars

1076
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:32,219
a year or more in sales and this is

1077
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,559
something that I couldn't have done last

1078
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:37,049
year but we now have I think 14

1079
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:41,219
companies on this page when we're

1080
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:42,960
updating it as the numbers change that

1081
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:45,119
are on track to ten million dollars a

1082
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,449
year or more in revenue and in fact some

1083
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,659
of them are pushing 30 million or 40

1084
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:54,059
million in a year so I think as an

1085
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:56,129
investor this is to answer your question

1086
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:57,989
what's gonna make these companies that

1087
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,090
are down work check and see if they're

1088
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:01,949
generating revenue and and of course

1089
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:03,809
just generating revenue isn't in the

1090
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:06,389
long run gonna be the only thing because

1091
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:07,259
you have to be profitable ultimately or

1092
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:10,469
you're gonna just have to keep going

1093
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,060
back to the markets and diluting and you

1094
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:13,769
know forcing your price low or overtime

1095
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:16,230
as there's more shares but that that

1096
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:18,599
would be my first clue to take a look

1097
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,699
and see if what kind of progress they've

1098
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,500
make is if you go back and you look at

1099
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:25,529
the companies that were trading at the

1100
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,989
beginning of 2014 most of them haven't

1101
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:29,160
really done anything Shango

1102
00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:31,319
unfortunately now the good news is we

1103
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:32,460
have a bunch of new companies that have

1104
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,870
come along that I think are pretty

1105
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,300
interesting a lot of them are on that

1106
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:39,420
list right on you know I had never

1107
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,900
considered how much of the early

1108
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:45,720
cannabis stock was held inside and

1109
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,420
therefore that that 10% that was the

1110
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,849
public float that was people were

1111
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,740
investing not based on the

1112
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:54,739
characteristics of the company they were

1113
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:58,979
the price was going up based on scarcity

1114
00:43:54,739 --> 00:44:03,000
exactly value yes no wonder so many of

1115
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,760
those turned around as as their their

1116
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,440
angel investors and original owners you

1117
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,810
know dumped some of their stock so that

1118
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,650
they could you know eat and live and you

1119
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:15,179
know RIA you know RIA

1120
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,650
yeah it was a little bit that but just

1121
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:18,690
to be clear these companies didn't have

1122
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,160
much in the tournament operations so

1123
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,530
just to keep the lights on they had to

1124
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,779
but not the individuals necessarily

1125
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:26,010
although that was partially the case I

1126
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,820
mean I'm sure you remember a med box

1127
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:30,040
yeah but

1128
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,200
they also just had to like race and

1129
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,590
capital and so you mean like fundraising

1130
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:37,899
using it as a yes insider selling but

1131
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,820
yes fundraising and a good example I

1132
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,470
mean this is such a sad example and I

1133
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:46,120
actually like this company by the way

1134
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:47,230
it's called CV Sciences they they've

1135
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:48,519
they've gone in a slightly different

1136
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,840
direction because they're trying to

1137
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:54,969
develop through the FDA path a

1138
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,160
chewing-gum with CBD and nicotine but

1139
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:58,719
their core business they're on my list

1140
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:00,369
they're doing more than ten million

1141
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,379
dollars a year in sales selling CBD

1142
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:04,839
products they're highly regarded there

1143
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,650
and so this is one of these stocks that

1144
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,360
have that thin float and went to like

1145
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:13,150
$200 a share and you know even today

1146
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,640
it's at 30 cents a share so hey you know

1147
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:17,230
it's kind of funny but so the stock goes

1148
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:19,539
up to 200 they get on the cover of

1149
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,900
Forbes magazine there was insider

1150
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:24,880
selling but then they ended up raising a

1151
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,619
bunch of money below $1 a share

1152
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,539
you know they raised some at $2 after

1153
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:30,699
the stock was at 200 and that that was

1154
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:32,440
the reality 200 was not the reality

1155
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:34,539
right now that makes sense you know

1156
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,820
there's before we go to commercial you

1157
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:39,460
know there's there's one more category

1158
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:41,740
of investor that I think that a lot of

1159
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:45,130
people ignore and those are the people

1160
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:47,589
who are involved with sweat equity right

1161
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,849
these are not necessarily public

1162
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:51,280
companies as a matter of fact they're

1163
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:54,429
either pre public or just privately held

1164
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,680
but they're people who are who have been

1165
00:45:54,429 --> 00:45:59,190
told okay I'd like you to come in and

1166
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:02,710
run my lab and set it up and use your

1167
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:04,329
consulting expertise but we don't want

1168
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,210
to pay you decently we want to pay you

1169
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:10,150
you know 15 bucks an hour and we're

1170
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,829
gonna give you a quit in the company and

1171
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,110
this happened so often during the

1172
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:16,090
dot-com boom even to me where I had

1173
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:17,829
equity and six or seven companies that

1174
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:19,990
were worth less than a rubber duck with

1175
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:22,150
a hole in it right and so I think we're

1176
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:25,000
seeing a lot of that now where there are

1177
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:27,130
a lot of employees who they want to be

1178
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,289
part of a company that's gonna make it

1179
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:32,559
and they want to make their Green Rush

1180
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:36,039
money buy by taking a lower wage and

1181
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:38,349
also you know taking some sweat equity

1182
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:40,820
do you have any advice for an employee

1183
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:43,699
who's thinking about taking some equity

1184
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:46,190
in lieu of you know immediate financial

1185
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:47,929
compensation yeah well that's a good

1186
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:49,130
question I have not given it thought but

1187
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:50,690
the first thing that comes to mind

1188
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,760
because I haven't really seen that I

1189
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,380
don't really get into that granular of a

1190
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,260
level but if you're working for a

1191
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:59,450
company and they want you to take equity

1192
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:01,850
take a look at what they're showing

1193
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,439
outside investors just so you understand

1194
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:05,029
exactly what you're getting I mean this

1195
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,280
is not just the cannabis industry but

1196
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,320
any industry and I've heard this before

1197
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,130
a lot of times you know people can be

1198
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,600
really smart they can be an engineer or

1199
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:16,849
you know some sort of graphic design or

1200
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,289
really smart at what they do it doesn't

1201
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:20,690
mean that they understand how to value

1202
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:22,699
companies or anything like that so get a

1203
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,860
get a copy of what they're showing

1204
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:26,899
investors if you don't understand it

1205
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,730
take it to somebody who does pay them a

1206
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,490
couple hundred bucks whatever it is to

1207
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:34,099
have somebody say you know what is it or

1208
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:35,689
if they're giving me 10,000 options what

1209
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,509
does that even mean are there 10

1210
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:41,480
gazillion shares are there 20 shares it

1211
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:43,370
is extreme so I think that can be really

1212
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,980
challenging for a lot of people because

1213
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:47,989
not everybody has that expertise you

1214
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,639
know so that would be my advice right on

1215
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:51,049
we're gonna take another short break and

1216
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,239
be right back you're listening to

1217
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,610
shaping fire and my guest today is Alan

1218
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:59,149
Broxton founder of new cannabis ventures

1219
00:47:55,610 --> 00:48:00,769
and 420 investor we humans are attracted

1220
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,780
to plants because they offer us relief

1221
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:04,610
and are a whole lot of fun sometimes

1222
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,650
though the best parts are buried inside

1223
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:09,079
the plant and we need to use specialty

1224
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:11,180
extraction technology when it comes to

1225
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,340
cannabis it is extraordinarily important

1226
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:15,649
to extract its precious oils without

1227
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,970
changing them in the process we want to

1228
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,650
preserve the properties of the

1229
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:20,799
cannabinoids terpenes and other

1230
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:24,530
constituents that all work together

1231
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,510
since 1994 Eden labs has been developing

1232
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:29,630
extraction technology and processes to

1233
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,400
do just that Eden labs was founded by a

1234
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,019
cannabis loving engineer during the

1235
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,930
early days of medical marijuana in

1236
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:37,250
California and the expanded Eden team

1237
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:39,500

industry-leading solutions for cannabis

1239
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,969

1240
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:46,789
Eden labs flagship product is the newly

1241
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:48,919
improved High Flow co2 extractor as

1242
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:51,110
other extraction companies enter the

1243

market it is the high flow from Eden

1244

compare themselves with

1246
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,220

Shango low sin our guest this week is

1321
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:49,159
Alan Broxton founder of new cannabis

1322
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,360
ventures and 4/20 investor so Alan in

1323
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:53,089
this last section you know we've been

1324
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:56,269
talking a lot about what we see now and

1325
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:58,519
so often with investing people are

1326
00:51:56,269 --> 00:52:01,190
they've got their head down and and and

1327
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:04,909
they're learning and they're looking too

1328
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:07,730
much in the now what do you see out ten

1329
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:09,949
years in this industry that investors

1330
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,300
should be considering when investing in

1331
00:52:09,949 --> 00:52:14,149
things at this time

1332
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:18,170
wow this industry changes so fast ten

1333
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:19,550
years is like 50 years sure I don't know

1334
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:22,119
if I have a ten year view but let me

1335
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:26,840
just answer it as a longer-term view so

1336
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:28,969
one of you know is a us from a us focus

1337
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,140
one of the things obviously is you know

1338
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:31,909
what's gonna happen with the federal

1339
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:35,119
government and my own view there is

1340
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:37,369
we're not gonna see any big changes in

1341
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,099
the next few years maybe after the next

1342
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:42,109
presidential election the problem is is

1343
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:44,360
as much as people is the federal

1344
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:46,970
politicians seem to be accepting of it

1345
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:49,490
it's a very complex issue and you have

1346
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:50,149
to deal with things like getting read a

1347
00:52:49,489 --> 00:52:52,129
280e

1348
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,809
which the government makes a lot of

1349
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,460
money off of so do they want to do that

1350
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:57,199
then you're gonna get into things like

1351
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,019
does Colorado really want it to be

1352
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:02,449
federally legal there if so they they're

1353
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:03,949
gonna lose tax money because California

1354
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:06,349
is gonna be able to export to Colorado

1355
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:07,969
we have so many different things that

1356
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,889
are gonna have to be resolved in the

1357
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:13,489
next few years then I don't think

1358
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:16,159
federal legality is in the next five

1359
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:17,899
years I think and that's fine I mean

1360
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,920
that I wish they would legalize it but I

1361
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,750
think from an investor's perspective

1362
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,980
that's fine because it allows a lot of

1363
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,309
companies to kind

1364
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:27,260
of build-up without having to face a lot

1365
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:29,119
of competition and there was a deal that

1366
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,520
your listeners should be aware of which

1367
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,140
took place it was announced right at the

1368
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:37,579
end of October and closed early November

1369
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:40,629
where a us-based liquor company or

1370
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:45,199
alcohol company Constellation Brands put

1371
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:49,039
190 million us into canopy growth which

1372
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:51,559
is the largest Canadian you know

1373
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:54,259
federally licensed producer and and that

1374
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:57,349
was a game-changer in a lot of ways but

1375
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:58,730
the main thing it really said was a the

1376
00:53:57,349 --> 00:54:02,179
alcohol industry is a little bit

1377
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:03,889
concerned be hey maybe it's okay to make

1378
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:05,480
an investment in cannabis but you got a

1379
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:07,789
structure properly make sure it's

1380
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,760
federally legal and I think in the next

1381
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:14,900
few years we're going to see a lot more

1382
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:16,609
interest from Big Pharma in the alcohol

1383
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,650
industry it may be a little bit tobacco

1384
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:22,549
I don't really personally see how

1385
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:24,410
tobacco has much to do with cannabis I

1386
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,670
know a lot of people like to say that it

1387
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:28,009
does and there's some distribution

1388
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,780
things I guess but the reality is I

1389
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:31,640
think those other two industries as I

1390
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,680
look out in the next few years that's

1391
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:35,929
good from a u.s. investor that's gonna

1392
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,489
be something to really focus on and at

1393
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:40,039
the same time to watch some of the

1394
00:54:37,489 --> 00:54:42,679
better companies really develop their

1395
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:44,719
franchises in the very complex difficult

1396
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:47,299
markets to navigate right now where you

1397
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,368
can't ship across state lines and you

1398
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:52,400
have to deal with all these local rules

1399
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:53,840
and state rules and things like that but

1400
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,730
the other thing I think is going to be

1401
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,490
really big and I've been talk about this

1402
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:00,260
for a while is the globalization of

1403
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:02,029
cannabis and we're seeing it in Latin

1404
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,520
America we're seeing in Australia we're

1405
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,500
seeing it in Europe and and of course

1406
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:08,358
Canada which I mentioned before and the

1407
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,010
u.s. is getting left behind and it's

1408
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:12,259
kind of ironic to me because we have a

1409
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:14,060
president who likes to be a winner and

1410
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,830
we are a loser when it comes to the

1411
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:18,608
global platform of cannabis and the

1412
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:21,019
whole world is moving ahead and I think

1413
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:22,759
anybody that's looking at cannabis

1414
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:27,019
should really start to think long and

1415
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:29,570
hard about expanding their opportunity

1416
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:31,400
set and especially when you look at

1417
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,960
things like Germany and it's a little

1418
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,588
bit slow to play out but they have

1419
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,838
pharmacy distribution that's covered by

1420
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:39,940
insurance and it's a small program now

1421
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:42,518
but it's going to get a lot bigger and

1422
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,979
that's the way the world is headed where

1423
00:55:42,518 --> 00:55:47,439
medical cannabis is going to be legal

1424
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:50,108
everywhere federally except apparently

1425
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,059
the United States I think that's a

1426
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:53,949
really good point that you're making in

1427
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:56,769
and I talk about it a lot with my own

1428
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:58,328
clients this this area of business right

1429
00:55:56,768 --> 00:55:59,949
like it's I think that's gonna come in

1430
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:02,559
two waves you're gonna have your first

1431
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:04,328
wave when eventually we'll be able to

1432
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,278
ship interstate right and so you've got

1433
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:09,190
you've got the all these these these

1434
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:11,440
states where you cannot naturally grow

1435
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:13,420
outdoors very easily I mean my state's

1436
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,889
one of them here in Washington we've

1437
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,499
only got a small part of the state that

1438
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:20,618
gets enough warmth and Sun and as soon

1439
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:22,959
as our market is able to be colonized by

1440
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:26,769
California it's going to drastically

1441
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,809
change the outlooks of companies here in

1442
00:56:26,768 --> 00:56:32,379
Washington or or anywhere on the

1443
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:35,170
northern side of the country where

1444
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:37,869
suddenly business plans that seem solid

1445
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:40,989
if you only were doing business in your

1446
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:43,269
state are suddenly going to be trashed

1447
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:45,909
because the southern states with a lot

1448
00:56:43,268 --> 00:56:48,218
more sunshine are going to be coming in

1449
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:51,940
and and similarly on the international

1450
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:54,729
level oh my goodness once once Central

1451
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:58,329
America and Mexico are able to grow

1452
00:56:54,728 --> 00:57:00,399
outdoor and process organic cannabis

1453
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:02,499
oils and ship them the United States the

1454
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,269
floor is just gonna drop out of the oil

1455
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:07,088
market and I don't think a lot of

1456
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:09,488
investors are thinking about how

1457
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:11,858
drastically the market itself is gonna

1458
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:14,318
shift hey you want me to throw another

1459
00:57:11,858 --> 00:57:16,478
one in that they're not quite there yet

1460
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:19,748
but this whole concept of biosynthesis

1461
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:21,879
where you can grow cannabinoids and not

1462
00:57:19,748 --> 00:57:25,778
just THC or CBD which are expressed

1463
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:27,009
pretty frequently but some of the some

1464
00:57:25,778 --> 00:57:29,739
of the cannabinoids that are expressed

1465
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:32,949
less frequently like CBD v that may be

1466
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:34,869
very valuable for medical purposes you

1467
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:38,618
can do this without cannabis you can do

1468
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:40,599
it through this biotech process and you

1469
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:43,150
know imagine putting all this money into

1470
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:45,400
indoor grows all that capex and all the

1471
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:48,910
sudden the infused cannabis industry

1472
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,619
just starts buying the biosynthesized

1473
00:57:48,909 --> 00:57:52,239
have annoyed zai and that's something I

1474
00:57:50,619 --> 00:57:53,589
think people need to be aware of why the

1475
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:55,029
longer term yeah that's really

1476
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,820
interesting I can totally see the

1477
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:00,700
upcoming shaping fire on that topic now

1478
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:03,039
yeah we did we did 100 about three

1479
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:05,589
months ago on synthetic cannabinoids and

1480
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,989
and you know the the the general push on

1481
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:10,390
that is that there's their synthetic and

1482
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:12,099
and they've got attributes chemically

1483
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:16,059
that are non natural and so they've got

1484
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:18,489
real they can have real negative both

1485
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:20,440
agonist and antagonist attributes but

1486
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:24,250
but what you're describing is actually

1487
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:26,320
growing the the molecule exactly as it

1488
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:28,210
occurs in cannabis so yes well it's

1489
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:31,090
isolate and we can argue to what degree

1490
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,260
isolates are useful for health and

1491
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,760
recreation that's a different

1492
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:36,760
conversation but the fact that they

1493
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,770
could just grow CBD v in a lab and have

1494
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,450
it be molecular accurate yeah you're

1495
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:43,389
right that'll that'll reshape parts of

1496
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:45,519
the industry as well yep yeah well Alan
