available anywhere else

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,039
I require speakers like today and take

12
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:40,959
it home and I put it on my youtube

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,549
channel so if you are not able to go to

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,289
all the conventions and you want to hear

15
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:46,178
some of these hot speakers that aren't

16
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:47,859
speaking near where you live I encourage

17
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:51,280
you to check out the shaping fire

18
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:54,969
YouTube channel our presentation right

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,010
now is from Erin Pulaski from go pure

20
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,948
pressure will be speaking on solve

21
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:02,588
unless extraction explained rosin bubble

22
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:04,478
hash dry sift Erica was a founding

23
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:06,340
member of mass roots and is now director

24
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,620
of marketing at pure pressure in Denver

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,570
Colorado Eric has worked with canvas

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,728
companies in every facet of the industry

27
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,679
and today we'll be talking about solvus

28
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:18,849
solvent 'less extraction techniques

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,110
all right thank you all for coming

30
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:22,478
I'm gonna try and make this as

31
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:24,310
informative and interesting as possible

32
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,109
I'm really excited about solving this

33
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,920
extraction and thank you all for being

34
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:31,269
here by show of hands how many people

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,100
here feel that they are at least

36
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:37,149
somewhat familiar with solving this

37
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:39,188
extraction great that's what I was

38
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:40,810
hoping for the beginning of this is

39
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:42,158
going to be a little bit higher surface

40
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,320
level and then we're really going to

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,340
kind of get into some details some of

42
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,898
the topics we're going to be covering

43
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,640
today it will be about 30 minutes of

44
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:51,759
presentation then I'd like to leave you

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,989
know at least 15 for Q&amp;A at the end we

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,250
were getting a lot of questions at the

47
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,328
booth so I want to make sure that we can

48
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,399
answer as many of your questions as

49
00:01:55,328 --> 00:02:00,339
possible so what we're going to go

50
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,929
through today is a lay of the land of

51
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,270
extraction in general and we're a

52
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,640
solvent list fits into that some of the

53
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:08,379
advantages and challenges of solvent

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,868
list extraction how it might fit into

55
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,129
your facility or someone that you know

56
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:15,069
the popular types of products and

57
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,019
textures as well as you know myths and

58
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,939
what's almond less can and can't do

59
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:21,039
so this should give everyone in here

60
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,870
good idea of what solvent less

61
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,669
extraction is all about where it's

62
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,740
heading in the next year or two things

63
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:28,750
are changing very quickly and the main

64
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,490
products that we will be focusing on our

65
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,069
ice water extracts you know otherwise

66
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,170
known as bubble hash dry scepter Keef

67
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:38,979
and of course rosin kind of which is

68
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:41,799
becoming the big daddy of them all so

69
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:44,590
I'd like to preface this conversation by

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,600
basically saying that you know the

71
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,120
future of cannabis really is processing

72
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,609
in your average grocery store anywhere

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,860
from 10 to 20 percent of the perishable

74
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,570
items are actually produce virtually

75
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,730
everything else in a grocery store has

76
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,250
been processed in one way or another so

77
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:02,759
what we're really looking at is cannabis

78
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,590
being pretty much the most versatile

79
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,389
drug for recreational purposes and

80
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,670
medical purposes that can be turned into

81
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,769
so many different things everything from

82
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,549
every edible that you can ever imagine

83
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,380
people are already seeing that vape pens

84
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,450
abs and concentrates of every texture

85
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:22,090
that you've ever seen and perhaps have

86
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:25,209
never heard of we are pretty much on the

87
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,069
cusp of a global market and it's easy

88
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,020
for us to kind of lose sight you know in

89
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:30,729
our states where we can't even move

90
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,070
products across state lines

91
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:35,139
things are very siloed and segmented in

92
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,120
the northwest some of the concentrates

93
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,579
are starting to make their way up here a

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,039
lot of the popular textures that people

95
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,719
are paying $100 a gram for in California

96
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,579
are now starting to be produced in

97
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,810
Oregon and Washington where you know

98
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,019
they've been in California and Colorado

99
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,750
for a year or two already so a lot of

100
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,849
the trends are coming out of Colorado in

101
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,030
California but I think as time goes on

102
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:00,939
we're really going to see products that

103
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,370
are sold out for potentially a year at a

104
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:05,199
time Boutique growers that are so

105
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,519
popular with their concentrates and

106
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,919
their products once those products can

107
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,439
cross state lines that you'll be seeing

108
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,659
people backward for who knows how long

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,609
and this is kind of focusing a little

110
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:18,399
bit we're solvent less really fits in is

111
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:23,350
in the boutique end of the market really

112
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,099
high-end products so going more from

113
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,170
that

114
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,780
you know more and more consumers or

115
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,920
seeking concentrated products and we're

116
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,909
going to go into some facts and some

117
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,460
data a little bit later in the

118
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,100
presentation but anyone that follows MJ

119
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:38,079
vis new frontier had said a lot of these

120
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,629
great data sources pretty much

121
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:44,789
concentrates are being consumed more and

122
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:48,159
more at the expense of flour so a high

123
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,870
amount of flour is basically being

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,100
converted into concentrates and as

125
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,420
Colorado Washington Nevada California

126
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,060
those are some of the main areas that

127
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,250
decent data is available on your over

128
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,870
your concentrate consumption growth not

129
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,449
just solvent list but all concentrates

130
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,850
in general is increasing and we expect

131
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,439
to see that same trend over time and

132
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,260
pretty much all maturing markets that

133
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,480
once cannabis becomes legal people are

134
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,099
very excited they're purchasing joints

135
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,110
and flour and you know this is great and

136
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,850
then their taste preferences tend to

137
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,160
change they say oh well how about

138
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,020
edibles and what is a DAB and and what

139
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,670
is that going to do for me and of course

140
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:27,339
as people's tolerances grow they're

141
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,110
looking for different experiences so

142
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:31,810
pretty much across the board in Colorado

143
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:35,139
and California concentrate growth is

144
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,329
right around 25 23 percent depending on

145
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,879
where you're getting your data from that

146
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:41,769
as a percentage of the products sold in

147
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,870
the northwest the data that we've been

148
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:45,279
told is right around 18 percent so

149
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,399
there's definitely still room there

150
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,959
where it's growing there's a lot more

151
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,879
consumption of concentrates that's going

152
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:57,489
to be happening virtually everywhere as

153
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:59,589
the markets expand so to really define

154
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,689
solvent was extraction what we're

155
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:04,719
looking at is a process of mechanical

156
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:07,120
separation and mechanical separation is

157
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,580
different from using solvents because

158
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,100
what you're having is various physical

159
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:14,500
forces that are separating the trichomes

160
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,240
and the cannabinoids as opposed to

161
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,160
dissolving them into solvents so when

162
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,030
you're running butane any hydrocarbon

163
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,350
co2 any of those solvent based processes

164
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:24,819
what you're running into is a

165
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,100
dissolution of

166
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,990
avenues and terpenes and then your

167
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,260
reforming that taking things out you

168
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,720
know recovering your solvents so

169
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:37,990
mechanical separation is anything from

170
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,000
shearing breaking things open with rosin

171
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,060
and we'll get into that but that really

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,519
is the main distinction and what I'm not

173
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,769
gonna spend time talking as much day is

174
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,439
what's better because people have all

175
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:52,269
kinds of different taste preferences we

176
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,009
believe in peer pressure that there are

177
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:56,529
solvent based concentrates that are

178
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:58,689
absolutely elite and made very well and

179
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:00,219
when urged properly but what we've also

180
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:02,980
seen is that a lot of companies will

181
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,600
take products that aren't the highest

182
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,640
quality necessarily and then they will

183
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,920
use that to put that through certain

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,029
hydrocarbon and other systems so one of

185
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,550
the big things that we're going to talk

186
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,709
about today is where quality fits into

187
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,840
the equation and how quality is such a

188
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:19,120
big part of being successful with

189
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:21,099
solvent --less concentrates but it's

190
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,930
important to understand that when you're

191
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,360
actually making a solvent less

192
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,920
concentrated you're not dissolving it

193
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,509
with a solvent seems pretty

194
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,699
straightforward but that's one of the

195
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:33,430
questions that we get all day every

196
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:36,159
single day to go back a little bit you

197
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,319
know hash is being made for as long as

198
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,730
of millennium almost the the earliest

199
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,319
reference that I could find when

200
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,319
researching for this presentation was

201
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,319
eleventeen 23 that there's references of

202
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,810
hash being made in middle east so

203
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,610
solvent list concentrates called that

204
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,280
have technically been around for maybe a

205
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,800
thousand years or more people have been

206
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,109
making hash in various ways all across

207
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,370
the world mainly concentrated in Asia

208
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,189
the Middle East where it was getting

209
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,259
started collecting resin from cannabis

210
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:06,699
plants forming in different ways I'm

211
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,529
sure a lot of people especially people

212
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,000
who have been you know consuming and

213
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:13,209
been around for a lot longer than I have

214
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,339
Thai sticks Turkish hash all kinds of

215
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:17,799
different products that before were the

216
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,659
concentrated potency increases that

217
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,340
people were consuming and now we're

218
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,650
seeing this absolutely massive

219
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,829
proliferation of different textures

220
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:28,870
concentrates extraction methods

221
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:30,139
everything that you can imagine so cash

222
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,089
has been around for

223
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,649
a really long time I'm sure a lot of

224
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,450
people here may finally remember you

225
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,370
know sprinkling Keef on a bowl or a

226
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,019
little bit of round bubble hash and you

227
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,519
know increasing the potency of whatever

228
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:43,190
they were smoking and layering into a

229
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:47,299
joint and now you've got you know 99.9%

230
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:49,310
pure THC a distillate that will take you

231
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:52,569
to the moon and back in a tiny little

232
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:55,039
dab so we've seen a massive massive

233
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,589
evolution in the way that concentrates

234
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,629
are being produced and we expect that to

235
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,730
continue I mean this is really the tip

236
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:04,338
of the iceberg with solvent Wisconsin

237
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,870
traits as well as solvent based and who

238
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,370
knows if there's other categories that

239
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,379
are going to get developed that we're

240
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,240
not even really aware of right now I

241
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:15,769
mean this is really all just getting

242
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,879
started so pretty much where we're at

243
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:21,320
with the main separation here so I just

244
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,879
wanted to give everyone a little bit of

245
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,860
a lay of the land I think a lot of

246
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,500
people have familiarity with

247
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,539
concentrates in general but just to kind

248
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,899
of educate everyone on where things

249
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:36,049
break down these are the primary methods

250
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:38,269
of solvent based distillate is can be

251
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:40,309
run without solvents such as in steam

252
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:43,190
distillation or it can be used with

253
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:44,268
solvents and of course the main solvent

254
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,040
list categories that we're going to

255
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:49,299
spend most of our time talking about

256
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,299
today so

257
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,050
one thing that you'll notice here is

258
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:58,750
that on the bottom of this fairly busy

259
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:01,029
slide is that there's a lot of textures

260
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,610
and one of the things that we run into a

261
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,529
lot is that people are saying well can I

262
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,110
can I make sadder with a rosin press and

263
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:11,079
the answer is that you can most of the

264
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:15,070
time now with hydro carbon you're

265
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,080
looking at a much bigger array of great

266
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,930
you know various textures that you can

267
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,990
actually access compared to co2 for

268
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:25,839
example or ethanol or distillate simply

269
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,940
put hydrocarbon and rosin tend to be the

270
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,470
most versatile in terms of the textures

271
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,960
that you can actually create with those

272
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,019
systems so you know blog Reza and

273
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,090
terpene separation diamonds shatter wax

274
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,519
butter I mean there's a lot of ways to

275
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,470
skin a cat with how many different forms

276
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,029
and textures there are a lot of it comes

277
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,910
down to personal preference

278
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,889
you know if you could go back in time 3

279
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:49,929
4 years and start talking to people

280
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:52,269
about diamonds and sauce they would have

281
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:53,289
no idea what your apple sauce like what

282
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,049
are you even talking about they don't

283
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:58,509
know shatter was of course this huge

284
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:59,979
revolution people were taking dabs and

285
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:02,259
it was pretty much all made with butene

286
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,920
sometimes at home sometimes in a very

287
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:08,200
sketchy on fire now not a very friendly

288
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,659
environment to be doing that kind of but

289
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,080
now people are figuring out all kinds of

290
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:15,459
very very interesting ways to make

291
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,220
kaleidoscope of textures with different

292
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,019
terpene concentrations all kinds of

293
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,000
different flavors it's really becoming

294
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,000
such a boutique industry across the

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,220
board that now as well as in the solvent

296
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,129
list category where before we were

297
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,889
really just looking at Keith's bubble

298
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:34,570
hash older forms of hashish you know if

299
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,490
anyone's familiar with Frenchy canola or

300
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,379
someone you know the big name older hash

301
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,789
makers you know there's all these

302
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:42,039
different ways to make solvent list but

303
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:44,769
now rosin has really come on to the

304
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,899
scene as a popular concentrate that's

305
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,449
growing very quickly in the past couple

306
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,759
years one other thing I'd like to point

307
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,730
out

308
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,220
- is that well co2 ethanol and

309
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,289
distillate I just have them listed as

310
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,899
oils a lot of these products are being

311
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:02,620
used and substrates for adults so

312
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:05,419
depending on what you're trying to do

313
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,220
virtually any of these products can go

314
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:09,229
into edibles which then of course your

315
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,449
complexity of the products that you can

316
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,879
offer is times a million because how

317
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:15,919
many things can we eat there are better

318
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,028
and less better ways to make edibles

319
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,219
depending on what you're shooting for

320
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:21,139
but one of the things that we run into

321
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,759
again a lot is that you know what what

322
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:25,909
can Roz and really do what can you

323
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:28,759
actually turn rosin into and the answer

324
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:30,019
is that almost everything that you can

325
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,789
with hydrocarbon which we've actually

326
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,528
been surprised by some of our clients

327
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:35,448
who have been actually taking us to

328
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:37,850
school on what they can do with some of

329
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:40,789
our equipment people are doing full-on

330
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,470
terpene separations live rosin with

331
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:44,509
fresh frozen bubble hash that they're

332
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,820
washing people are making solvent list

333
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:48,620
diamonds you can make shatter with

334
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,699
certain strains depending on the terpene

335
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,459
concentrations

336
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:54,740
I mean wax all the other textures are

337
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:57,679
all being made by certain companies on

338
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,139
rosin presses as well so it's pretty

339
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,149
cool to see that you can spend a lot

340
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:04,818
less on equipment and potentially make

341
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,578
some of these textures I'm not going to

342
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:08,568
spend time talking about the hydrocarbon

343
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,789
and the other systems in this

344
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:13,129
presentation but I just kind of wanted

345
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:16,009
to show everyone where the textures

346
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:17,689
break down because there's a lot of

347
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:22,129
variation here and it's something you

348
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:25,639
hear about a lot so I wanted to cover

349
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:27,379
some myths that again these are all

350
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,509
based on questions that we get in our

351
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:31,549
inbox and get a call all day every day

352
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:34,399
is that solvent list is less potent

353
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:38,000
that's the first one people have found a

354
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,059
way to isolate THC a with a rosin press

355
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,860
where you're getting 99% potency with it

356
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:44,750
or it's white crystals that are coming

357
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,519
out and they're nucleating those

358
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,750
crystals into the large diamonds and

359
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,860
then

360
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,720
sometimes they're putting them into

361
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,938
other products but the fact that matter

362
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,660
is is that with a solvent was set up you

363
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:57,730
can actually make extremely potent

364
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:01,269
concentrated products at chalice of last

365
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,879
year the highest rosin test result of

366
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:07,078
just a dabble oil product was in the low

367
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,430
90% range so extremely potent and

368
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,109
generally speaking in this some we're

369
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,849
going to talk about a lot is it really

370
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,470
boils down to quality and what's in

371
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,720
there in the first place so if you're

372
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,028
running very high quality material the

373
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,730
potency of your solvent Wisconsin traits

374
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:24,429
can be extremely high

375
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,470
60% tends to be what we've seen test

376
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:29,289
result wise to kind of be the bottom

377
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,930
threshold and that's not necessarily a

378
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:33,909
bad thing not everyone wants to take a

379
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,059
dab of THC isolate I mean I know I don't

380
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:38,230
it's too it's not really what I want

381
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,208
some people are looking for a little bit

382
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,949
more of a mellow experience and they can

383
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:45,039
have that with a solvent list product

384
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:46,990
the second one shattered does not equal

385
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:51,129
VH oh you know one of the biggest

386
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,629
misconceptions that we hear is can what

387
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:55,449
what is shattering you know what is this

388
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:57,430
even and shatter is simply a texture of

389
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:59,500
cannabis concentrates that behaves like

390
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:02,229
a thin glass you can break it with your

391
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,240
hands it flakes there's a couple

392
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,129
companies out there that have really

393
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,049
perfected the process of making rosin

394
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:09,759
shatter and it's one of the more popular

395
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:11,948
products that a lot of companies

396
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,659
especially a couple of years ago you

397
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:15,188
know it is popular it was popular it

398
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,448
depends on what state you're in but

399
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:19,179
sometimes shatter is the buzzword

400
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,799
shatter equals concentrates people

401
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:23,198
almost don't even think about the other

402
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,558
textures it's just Cham Cham Cham people

403
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,899
are making shattered with solvent less

404
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:30,730
concentrated setups the third big one

405
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,879
here is that solvent list has less

406
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,639
terpenes you know terpene content we've

407
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,800
seen tested as high as 16 percent or

408
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,808
more just slightly over with salt on the

409
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,969
sauce that's a company called a vlog if

410
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:44,350
you're in Denver that we work with it's

411
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,120
pretty incredible some of the test

412
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,759
results that people are getting with

413
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,350
their material they're able to get I

414
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:55,500
mean even some of the lower range bubble

415
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,509
hash frozen's are getting 5 to 10

416
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,120
terpene content so when you open that

417
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:02,490
jar it you know it's hitting you you're

418
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,840
smelling it it's extremely potent and

419
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,909
what you're really finding is that

420
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,910
you're getting a full spectrum extract

421
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:11,009
with most rosin you're finding that as

422
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:12,389
well as with bubble hash and just as an

423
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:15,000
aside even though it's not about beer

424
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,699
just for everyone's information full

425
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,769
spectrum basically means that you have a

426
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:24,720
range of cannabinoids and terpenoids

427
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:26,669
concentrates are going to offer a full

428
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,950
spectrum package meaning you haven't

429
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:30,269
distilled it down to simply just THC a

430
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,759
even though just like we talked about

431
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,559
that can basically be done here but

432
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,360
you're offering the full range of

433
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,069
terpenes and cannabinoids depending on

434
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,960
what the plan is giving you which can

435
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,970
lead to the entourage effect more

436
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,300
palliative effects for certain people

437
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,730
it's basically going to be the most

438
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,859
genuine representation of whatever plant

439
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,720
that was grown when it's being processed

440
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,269
into solvent that tends to be the most

441
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,610
genuine and authentic way of making a

442
00:16:54,269 --> 00:17:02,039
concentrate the last one can't be used

443
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,380
hemp is being processed into CBD hash

444
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,029
and people are selling that even on the

445
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,829
Internet I mean in Canada it's the Wild

446
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:11,009
West right now it's absolutely bonkers

447
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:12,269
up there you can buy CBD hash rosin on

448
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,609
the internet today and have it mailed to

449
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:17,309
your door I wouldn't recommend it you do

450
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:19,019
not want you know people don't want the

451
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:20,539
FBI know that you're buying that from

452
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:23,099
Canada

453
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:25,649
one thing that we've heard a lot too is

454
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,629
people haven't had great experiences

455
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,730
with rosin you know for all the people

456
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,070
that have had burnt popcorn flour rosin

457
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm sorry you know the industry is still

458
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:37,230
learning but now out there you will find

459
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,390
products if you look for them that are

460
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,970
the highest end that you can pretty much

461
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,630
imagine and we're really excited to see

462
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,120
where can be used with rosin it's a

463
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,800
process that doesn't play as nice with

464
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,989
solvent less extraction for reasons I'll

465
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,549
get into but it's pretty exciting what

466
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,700
people are doing across the board here

467
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:58,500
with extremely potent concentrates the

468
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,420
textures that we're talking about the

469
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,019
terpene content and being able to use

470
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,330
hemp in it as well

471
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:08,399
so to kind of get to the beef here we've

472
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:11,129
got our three primary categories of

473
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:14,038
solvents concentrates ice water hash

474
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,049
this is one probably most people are

475
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,210
familiar with at least at some level and

476
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:20,908
that's where you're using cold off cold

477
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,590
water and ice they're breaking and

478
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:25,049
making the trichome heads and stocks

479
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:27,808
brittle and they're breaking it off of

480
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:30,058
the canvas material itself into a slurry

481
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:32,460
of water which is then filtered through

482
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,319
different micron screens and then it's

483
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,409
dried so that that's the basic process

484
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,470
of making bubble hash it's made by hand

485
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:42,870
and drums it is made in portable washing

486
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,278
machines that people would buy for using

487
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:45,750
out in the backcountry people make

488
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:49,138
bubble hash in all kinds of different

489
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,849
ways and probably something that will

490
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:52,079
continue to be improved upon we feel

491
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:54,869
that that is actually one of the

492
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,148
categories that is expecting to see the

493
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:59,308
greatest evolution here in the next

494
00:18:57,148 --> 00:19:01,138
couple of years because many of the

495
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:02,638
professional bubble hash washers out

496
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:04,199
there either washing by hand

497
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:05,819
or again using one of these you know two

498
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,980
or three hundred dollar you know

499
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:10,378
portable plastic washing machines making

500
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,569
grams of bubble hash full melt that

501
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:14,459
sells for $100 a gram California you

502
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,288
know there's something there's something

503
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,000
not right there but if that's what it

504
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,308
takes to make that product then people

505
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,829
are doing a very good job of it the

506
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:24,869
drying process is something that has

507
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:27,750
been extremely tricky and has been the

508
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,408
realm of virtually experts only until

509
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,690
just recently

510
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:33,120
drying bubble hash you have this wet

511
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,308
sopping mass of trichome heads and

512
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,689
stalks if you're doing it right and then

513
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:39,240
actually dry that down so you're not

514
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,830
getting mold microbial issues it's a

515
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,720
very tricky process doing with air

516
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:44,579
drying but now people have found out

517
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,370
that with the life--all ization process

518
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:49,589
using freeze dryers you can pretty much

519
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:51,449
take all the headache out of making

520
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,980
bubble hash by popping it in a freeze

521
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,870
dryer and 24 hours later it comes out

522
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,149
perfectly dried it's a little more

523
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:58,649
complicated than that but a point being

524
00:19:57,148 --> 00:20:00,689
it's a lot easier to

525
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,180
than air-drying and you don't have to be

526
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:06,420
an absolutely tried true 10-year veteran

527
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,590
of drying it dry sister Keith again this

528
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,660
is probably going to be the most

529
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:11,279
familiar category my picture is pretty

530
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,450
blown out there so you can't see it just

531
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,210
pretend that there's Keith in that

532
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,730
little box what we've got here is

533
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,860
instead of taking your cannabis material

534
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,180
and putting it through water to break

535
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:23,279
off those trichome heads with cold

536
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,920
temperatures you're just sharing it so

537
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,829
the best Keef is usually made very

538
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,660
gently we find that a lot of the bubble

539
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:32,039
hash when people come to or excuse me a

540
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,009
lot of the dry sip that people come to

541
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:36,659
have us press for demonstrations is

542
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:39,000
sometimes less than 50 percent trichomes

543
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,009
and the rest plant material that reduce

544
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,319
all kinds of stuff and that just doesn't

545
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:45,329
do very well so when you're making dry

546
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:46,980
Ceptor Keith you know you definitely

547
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,769
want to be gentle on it less is more

548
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,259
sure everyone has smoked Keith and joy

549
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:54,000
Keith seen it and smelled it

550
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,559
Keith can be a little tricky though

551
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,390
because people want to beat it up a

552
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,579
little bit too much but the goal with

553
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,710
both of these products is to keep the

554
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,990
trichome heads as intact and unbroken as

555
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,850
possible when you start feeding up Keith

556
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,470
you're gonna find that those trichome

557
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,480
heads are splitting open you're getting

558
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,190
your oil and all these other things in

559
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,250
your mixture which is not going to be

560
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:16,350
conducive to rosin which is where pretty

561
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,470
much all this is heading and polo hash

562
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:21,569
and sift are now mainly being used as

563
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,240
precursors that are being pressed into

564
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:27,000
rosin because consumer preferences for

565
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,920
Keith have come way down people simply

566
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,559
aren't buying very much of it a lot of

567
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,720
the dry sift on the shelf isn't very

568
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,909
good in some places so a lot of places

569
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,950
are taking that Keith and processing it

570
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,900
into rosin and same goes with ice water

571
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,490
hash you know what could have passed is

572
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,380
high-quality bubble hash a couple of

573
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,180
years ago is now something that might

574
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,790
not ever move on a dispensary shelf

575
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,650
because of people's preferences and how

576
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:52,710
they've learned to you know love other

577
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,470
dabs basically a lot of places that are

578
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,779
doing all of these are still making full

579
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,269
melt bubble hash which is something that

580
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:02,190
is fairly difficult to create but what

581
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:05,500
that essentially means is that is the

582
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,450
highest quality level of your trichomes

583
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,460
that you are receiving through your

584
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,049
bubble hatch washing process sometimes

585
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,390
when you're watching hatch none of your

586
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:14,889
trichomes are full mountain and full

587
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,360
metal basically meaning that if you put

588
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,430
it on a nail you melt it you're trying

589
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,399
to dab it there's zero residue left

590
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,230
behind so what many solvent lists

591
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,390
extraction Labs are doing that are

592
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,220
focused on this are they will take their

593
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,190
full melt bubble mash if they're able to

594
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:33,100
produce it they will sell that in grams

595
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,380
or half grams for high prices and then

596
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:36,939
the rest of their grades that wouldn't

597
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,470
pass as full melt is what they're going

598
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,809
to go ahead and do is mix those all up

599
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,730
together and then press it into rosin so

600
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,980
with rosin you're using heat and

601
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,349
pressure to break open the trichome

602
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,240
heads and stocks which is releasing the

603
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:52,569
oil and then it's being filtered through

604
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,549
a fine mesh bag so that leaves a lot of

605
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:56,470
the plant material and the other stuff

606
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:58,599
you don't want behind it has the oil

607
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,789
coming out it doesn't need to be purged

608
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:03,369
it's ready to consume pretty much

609
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:05,740
immediately and this picture here again

610
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:07,809
the fidelity isn't there but that is

611
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,120
actually an example of rosin chatter

612
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:13,329
that's classed over that somebody

613
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:15,219
pressed out so I just want to talk a

614
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:17,409
little bit about the physics of rosin

615
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,150
and how rosin is being made because

616
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,279
people are gonna find that rosin is

617
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,500
extremely disruptive to the concentrate

618
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,210
industry in general rosin is something

619
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,279
that people can safely make at home

620
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,380
rosin is something that any amateur

621
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,700
grower can purchase a rosin press and

622
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,650
make dabs at home with their own

623
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,269
material knowing that they grew it it

624
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,190
doesn't have pesticides in it they're

625
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:37,750
comfortable with the quality that

626
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,630
they're growing hopefully and that they

627
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,569
can process it themselves so what we've

628
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,190
got here is a little bit of diagram that

629
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:46,648
one of my co-workers put together for us

630
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,889
which is either using compressed air or

631
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:52,768
a hydraulic cylinder you're pressing a

632
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:54,658
bag that is full of Kieff bubble hash or

633
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:56,819
flour one of your substrate materials

634
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,789
the pressure is being applied and then

635
00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:01,528
in between heat and then you have your

636
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:04,319
oil coming out and depending on the

637
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:06,388
distance between the center of the bag

638
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,888
and the edges of the plates that's

639
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:09,868
really going to dictate sometimes how

640
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:11,788
high-quality your oil is sometimes

641
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:14,908
people will press rosin on a giant

642
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:17,578
t-shirt press the evolution of rosin

643
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:20,278
presses has come a long way from hair

644
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:22,588
straighteners to t-shirt presses to

645
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:24,509
commercial rosin presses too now you

646
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:26,548
know we're on the verge of releasing a

647
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,979
pretty much fully automated version of

648
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:31,588
our press that press buttons it presses

649
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:34,409
it goes so in three or four short years

650
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:35,969
you've gone from you know guys Shanghai

651
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:37,619
and their girlfriends and wives hair

652
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:40,199
straighteners to squeeze the juice out

653
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:41,908
of a nut to you know a fully automated

654
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:46,339
system so it's pretty incredible to see

655
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:49,769
how fast things are changing here now

656
00:24:46,338 --> 00:24:51,808
this is one of the really big categories

657
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:53,098
that we get a lot of questions about

658
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:54,658
which is you know what are some of the

659
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:56,638
advantages of solving lists and then

660
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,649
where does solvent lists tend to

661
00:24:56,638 --> 00:25:00,718
struggle and I wanted to present you

662
00:24:58,648 --> 00:25:02,878
know very honestly and openly where

663
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:06,058
solvent list has challenges is where as

664
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:07,738
some of its advantages come in so I'll

665
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:10,229
start with the good which is that it's

666
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:12,389
vastly cheaper to get a solvent less

667
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:14,818
extraction system going I mean if you're

668
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:16,769
trying to do bubble hash and rosin and

669
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:18,449
you need sinks you need you literally

670
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:20,489
have an empty room and you were gonna

671
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:22,499
start making solvent less processing you

672
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:24,568
give that going anywhere from twenty to

673
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:27,709
forty thousand dollars you can get

674
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:30,358
started much much cheaper more easily

675
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:32,489
it's very simple and you sit and you

676
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:35,999
don't need that much to get going it's

677
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:37,440
much cheaper the yields are comparable

678
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:39,298
to hydrocarbon and other extraction

679
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,548
methods popular contrary to popular

680
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:43,150
belief this all really boils down to

681
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:45,579
quality which is something I'll get

682
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,670
the challenges section but that you can

683
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:50,679
get solid yields with solvent lists if

684
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,870
you know your grower and your genetics

685
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,269
or high quality that's really where

686
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:57,069
you're going to be the most successful

687
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:58,389
one of the biggest advantages is that it

688
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:00,609
doesn't require into safety

689
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,380
considerations you know see what do you

690
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:04,209
want rooms people that are familiar with

691
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,640
extraction rooms and build-outs

692
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,440
it could be extremely expensive some

693
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,520
people can spend as much as a hundred or

694
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,580
two hundred thousand dollars just

695
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,379
getting a C one D one room architected

696
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,639
and put in place not even including the

697
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,950
equipment that they're putting in there

698
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,900
so when you're pressing rosin we were

699
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,330
making bubble hash there's no solvents

700
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,640
there's nothing flammable it's pretty

701
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:26,710
straightforward the safety protocols or

702
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,020
much more simple fire departments are

703
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,370
very friendly we work with the Denver

704
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:32,470
Fire Department and I actually gave a

705
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:34,329
talk in LA earlier this year to fire

706
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,950
departments and they they almost laughed

707
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:38,139
me out of the room because of what I was

708
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,580
talking about like I'll solve unless

709
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,220
like why are you even here we know

710
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:44,439
that's fine so the last thing we've got

711
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,630
under the advantages is it retails for a

712
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,090
really high price per gram so again

713
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,770
every market in every area is gonna bear

714
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:52,928
different prices depending on different

715
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,819
consumer preferences but like I was

716
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:57,490
saying you know in California in

717
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:59,139
Colorado you're seeing premium grams of

718
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,210
these products retail from anywhere from

719
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,900
sixty to a hundred dollars sometimes

720
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,549
more on the recreational side of things

721
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,860
think craft brewing that's kind of the

722
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,869
best analogy that we have is you know

723
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:13,569
it's easier to get started with it it's

724
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:15,369
cheaper most the time that people are

725
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:16,659
really involved in this they have you

726
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:18,699
know boutique genetics that they're

727
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,308
really emphasizing and trying to put out

728
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,580
there some of the big challenges with

729
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:26,170
rasen scalability especially compared to

730
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:28,240
co2 or ethanol I mean if you're running

731
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,250
co2 machine you can put tons through

732
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,539
those with our equipment which has some

733
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,849
of the highest throughput on the market

734
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:36,220
you're looking at 10 to 15 pounds of dry

735
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:38,558
sift or hash in a day which is a lot for

736
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,420
a rosin press but compared to a ethanol

737
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:41,910
or a co2 machine you know that's that's

738
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,310
a drop in the bucket for

739
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:47,730
massive massive processing so again

740
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:50,669
smaller production if you're if you've

741
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,230
got a bunch of low-grade trim or middle

742
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,390
stuff that you're trying to run you know

743
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,160
rosin pressing might not be the right

744
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,900
method for you because you have so much

745
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,940
you have to go through the quality might

746
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,019
not be there it's probably not going to

747
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,620
deliver the results that you're looking

748
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:06,779
for the real real big thing here is that

749
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,959
it demands high quality material and

750
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:11,849
certain genetics to be successful so if

751
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,650
your material is very high quality you

752
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:16,679
can be successful if your material is

753
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,210
not your yields will suffer you are not

754
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,920
going to be making good bubble hash you

755
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,480
are not going to be making great Keef

756
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,330
and you are not going to be pressing

757
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,009
good rosin frankly so you know people

758
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:28,409
sometimes they'll come do demos with us

759
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:30,089
and they bring their all this swaggiest

760
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,160
material they can find and they think

761
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:34,349
you know I saw this all this gold

762
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,700
pouring out on your YouTube channel can

763
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:38,639
you do that and you know we're not

764
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,230
alchemists you know rosin and solvent

765
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,360
list is not alchemy you cannot turn lead

766
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,940
into gold and when it comes to solving

767
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:48,779
lists it's really an arms race to who

768
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:51,720
can be the best grower to make the best

769
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,920
nugs the top-shelf crystal mugs to put

770
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,140
into their solving the system

771
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,759
so Dad logic for example one of the

772
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,530
companies in Colorado we work with they

773
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,720
probably made more rosin than anyone in

774
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:02,789
Colorado they work with a company called

775
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,579
Verde natural which is their grow arm in

776
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:06,990
the business there are two companies and

777
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:08,549
what they do is with Burt a natural

778
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,589
every time they pull a harvest down dab

779
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:12,389
logic comes in and they take all the

780
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:13,949
buds they want they get first pick they

781
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,300
come in they pick out all the best stuff

782
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,000
and then they sell everything else on

783
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:19,529
the shelf daba logic washes it now to

784
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,720
some people that is a horror story

785
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:23,639
because they're selling a flower they

786
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,579
want to sell their best notes but again

787
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,259
as these markets evolved resin farming

788
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:29,639
is going to be more and more of a thing

789
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:32,519
where people are actually growing

790
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,620
specifically for the purpose simply of

791
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,210
extracting Green Dot labs and Boulder is

792
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:39,419
a great example there are innumerable

793
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:41,130
examples in California and of course in

794
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,620
the northwest as well there's last but

795
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,300
it's a growing

796
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:45,189
practice where people are simply growing

797
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:46,539
just to extract they are not even

798
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,789
selling their buds they are watching it

799
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:50,799
they're blasting in everything and then

800
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:53,349
again it works best with premium flower

801
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,069
whole plant fresh frozen or high-quality

802
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:56,319
Siddiqui

803
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:58,450
you cannot just run trim through a rasa

804
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,099
press it is not going to be successful

805
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,990
there's too much plant material in the

806
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:04,000
bag itself your yields will really

807
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,009
suffer so there's always a little bit of

808
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,420
post-processing going on to make some of

809
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:09,369
those premium products whether you're

810
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,200
washing your stuff and hash whether

811
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:13,119
you're sifting it there's a little bit

812
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,319
more work on the front end a little bit

813
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,449
less work on the back end because you

814
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,250
don't have to purge it whole plant fresh

815
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,740
frozen is really the way that a lot of

816
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,720
the elite labs are washing bubble hash

817
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,940
to make the best quality products and

818
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,860
then one of the real big ones is it

819
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,920
doesn't reduce or remove contamination

820
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:31,240
so if you've got PM in your product and

821
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,460
you're trying to press it into rosin

822
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,170
well you got PM in your rosin and that

823
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,610
is bad nobody wants to smoke that so

824
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:41,080
please don't do that it's my humble

825
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:42,729
request to all of you whatever problems

826
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:44,169
are having in your grow it's gonna come

827
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,940
through the bag there's just no way to

828
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,880
get around it you would need a micron

829
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,279
screen of a coffee filter three four or

830
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,860
five microns to be able to filter that

831
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,440
out and maybe not even there so you know

832
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:58,649
it has to be clean and if you've got a

833
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,210
big crop of stuff that's contaminated

834
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,650
rosin and solvent list will simply not

835
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,049
work unless you're trying to poison

836
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,370
people so you know a lot of people

837
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:09,129
they'll take that material and they'll

838
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:10,899
blasted co2 there are better efficient

839
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,240
ways to process material that's been

840
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:17,140
compromised solvent lists just simply is

841
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,789
not one of those ways so just some

842
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,050
market information just kind of go over

843
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:22,089
what we got here

844
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:24,159
premium full melt bubble hash and live

845
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:27,459
rosin to retail for sixty five hundred

846
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,500
dollars a gram in 2017 rosin was the

847
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,630
fastest-growing subcategory in Colorado

848
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,279
in Washington the growth is really

849
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,870
happening there and then overall

850
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,539
concentrate consumption growth has grown

851
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:40,089
by 11 percent Oregon last year

852
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:40,879
MJ Piz I'd highly recommend anyone who

853
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:42,470
does

854
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
purchase or check out their Factbook

855
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,710
they come out with one every year them

856
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,569
and had said they it's worth the money

857
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,799
if you want to learn the data this is

858
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:52,159
where this is pretty much all coming

859
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,960
from and then 13% of the processors pull

860
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,940
reported using solvent list as their

861
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,289
primary extraction method so to us we

862
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,400
were surprised to see that we thought it

863
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:59,569
would be less than that but there's

864
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,700
actually a lot of companies out there

865
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:06,619
really pushing solvent lists and that

866
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,930
number is absolutely growing so getting

867
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:10,669
towards the end here premium fresh

868
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,890
frozen bubble hash can be turned into

869
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,900
some really really cool products that

870
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,670
people would expect on the bottom left

871
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,259
here you have a hundred percent solvent

872
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:21,410
less cartridges that are being sold by

873
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:24,049
dad logic no PG no VG no holes of fires

874
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,190
is coming off the press exactly as it

875
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:28,009
goes into the cartridge that is

876
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,580
absolutely possible can't tell you guys

877
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:33,890
how it kill me but it is happening

878
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:35,990
solved it with sauce that retails for so

879
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,880
much it's crazy and then you've also got

880
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,950
THC isolate these are things we talked

881
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,350
about as well as food grade oil from

882
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,850
leftovers so whatever isn't your primo

883
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:46,279
stuff can also be made into high-end

884
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:47,869
edibles so pretty much you can use all

885
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:50,000
parts of the buffalo with solvent less

886
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:53,299
no matter what you're doing there's a

887
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,890
place for it and again the premium fresh

888
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:57,039
frozen derived bubble hash is really the

889
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,150
building block for a lot of these exotic

890
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,829
concentrates textures and things that

891
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,830
are being made with prosit

892
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:09,049
so in some solvents concentrates are

893
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,660
really quickly becoming a huge part of

894
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:13,490
the market here especially the high-end

895
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,340
market because of versatility someone

896
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,500
can go buy arroz impress make all these

897
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:20,899
different textures at home and you could

898
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,519
be a one-man band and and make some of

899
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,660
these products you don't have to invest

900
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,059
a million dollars and getting your

901
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,830
extraction lab started most of our

902
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:29,539
customers are actually existing

903
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:31,759
processing labs that might do

904
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:33,440
hydrocarbon or co2 is their primary

905
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,450
extraction method but they add on

906
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,000
solvent list to create a premium product

907
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,830
so doesn't take up a lot of space it's

908
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,250
easy to get started it's also very

909
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:45,019
simple to learn so we really see solvent

910
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,420
list as becoming you know one of the

911
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:49,940
bigger ends of the boutique concentrate

912
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,259
market as things evolved in the United

913
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,900
States and abroad

914
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:55,039
it's a highly versatile system you can

915
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,440
make all kinds of different products

916
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,509
with it it's not very expensive and it's

917
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,580
very safe and easy to learn so you know

918
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:03,890
as it becomes more known we're expecting

919
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:05,990
more and more and more people to really

920
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,730
latch on to this and have you know my

921
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,230
little girl I'm gonna process some of

922
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,820
this and then I'm gonna share it so

923
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,648
these are some of the big companies we

924
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,360
work with Willamette Valley alchemy is

925
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:16,460
here in Oregon same with Queenie labs

926
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,780
they do really great work and we were

927
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,610
actually at a dispensary yesterday and

928
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,140
we saw some bull valley alchemy hash we

929
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,519
were really excited to see that there

930
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,329
are definitely companies out here making

931
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:28,099
really good products so I'm pretty much

932
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:30,769
right there thank you all for coming

933
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,329
love to answer as many in all questions

934
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:34,130
and whatever questions that we don't get

935
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:36,289
through in the next couple minutes we're

936
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,300
at booth 406 right in front please come

937
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:39,860
talk to me and come talk to us we're

938
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,149
here all weekend and love to answer

939
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,149
whatever questions don't get there so

940
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,540
so every question go ahead and raise

941
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:53,128
your hand we've got about 10-12 minutes

942
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:53,128
for questions and I'll bring you the mic

943
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:00,429
the back back in the back so if you have

944
00:34:57,789 --> 00:35:02,619
a pound of really high premium flour and

945
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:04,599
you take it through a good rosin press

946
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:06,849
site from your company what kind of

947
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,980
yield in grams of rosin comes down the

948
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:11,380
bag and a typical situation yeah great

949
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,119
question there's a range of yields we

950
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,780
see anywhere from ten to thirty percent

951
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,029
so with premium high resin strains you

952
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,500
know well grown gorilla glues chem

953
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,480
strains there are certain strains that

954
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,909
really overperform you're gonna see in

955
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,289
the high teens low 20s and that's just

956
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:29,289
with flour Oz and the highest I've ever

957
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:32,019
personally witnessed was 31 or 32

958
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:33,550
percent roughly out in California some

959
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:35,969
guy that's the material that didn't even

960
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,960
look good and it just important so to

961
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:40,389
expand on that question just a little

962
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:44,199
bit too with Keith and sift you're

963
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:46,420
looking at 30 to 60% for a sift rosin

964
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:49,059
and then to bubble hash anywhere from 40

965
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,710
to 80% we've seen it go as high as into

966
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:52,420
the high 80s some people have claimed

967
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,860
low 90s we're not really sure where that

968
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,400
falls but with bubble hash it goes way

969
00:35:53,860 --> 00:36:00,420
up from there raise your hand if you've

970
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,420
got a question they're very good

971
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,300
we I used the freeze dryer and now you

972
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:07,769
put like you put like four or five

973
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,300
pounds of web-savvy

974
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:12,358
you know if you don't wash it with a

975
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,880
freeze dryer and when you bring it out

976
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:17,880
you get like these you get wafers anyway

977
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,230
like nothing I mean but then the liquid

978
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,289
that comes out of the freeze dryer

979
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,789
smells so good you slap your own mother

980
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:25,980
for what's in there let me just have

981
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:28,710
this cloudy foggy material with this

982
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:33,000
light oil that like builds up on the top

983
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:34,889
of it why is all my wonderful yummy

984
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,889
smells leaving my bubble hash and a

985
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:42,838
freeze dryer man yeah so what happened

986
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:44,368
how in God's name yeah so when you're

987
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:46,489
freeze drying bubble hash is what's

988
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,050
happening is you are warming up and

989
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:50,129
freezing it's the sublimation process of

990
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,300
your trichome head so when they're in

991
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,769
the freeze dryer they're gonna be warmed

992
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,289
up slightly it's all happening under a

993
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:56,940
vacuum so that water that's coming out

994
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:58,469
that's draining out can have a lot of

995
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,190
terpenes in it you know it's coming out

996
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:02,489
of the drain

997
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:04,920
wow this this smells so good yeah yep so

998
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:07,199
the short answer is that it kind of

999
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,088
comes down to process you know we we

1000
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,009
come come by the booth and let's talk

1001
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:13,380
about that because temperatures dry

1002
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,900
times how long are drying it there's

1003
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,059
ways to try and minimize terpene passive

1004
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,068
turkey loss through your you know the

1005
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,869
water that's actually being extracted

1006
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:23,639
there are definitely methods and things

1007
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:25,349
that we can you know hopefully point you

1008
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:26,699
in the right direction on that you know

1009
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,289
good bubble hash when it's being

1010
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:30,000
freeze-dried right in the terpene

1011
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:31,739
content you know hopefully your hash on

1012
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,300
the other end is still smelling is still

1013
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:34,739
smelling really good but there's

1014
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,269
definitely some ways and things that you

1015
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:37,769
can even do with that water potentially

1016
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:41,110
so

1017
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:44,380
[Laughter]

1018
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,990
I'm gonna have the same thing yeah so so

1019
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,880
some of my clients are running into

1020
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:50,889
processing rosin that's really Turkey

1021
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,079
okay and it has a hard time staying

1022
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:55,449
shelf stable because the tur player

1023
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,759
tends to separate do you find that that

1024
00:37:55,449 --> 00:38:00,669
is more process-oriented or more

1025
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,580
cultivar or strain oriented good

1026
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:06,820
question so what we find a lot is very

1027
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:10,539
high terpene content rosin tends to be

1028
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:12,910
less viscous so it's very oily it can be

1029
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:15,009
hard to work with a lot of it comes down

1030
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:17,139
to a storage properly so making sure

1031
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,730
it's in an airtight container as best

1032
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:20,710
you possibly can making sure it's in a

1033
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:23,139
refrigerator or a freezer you know

1034
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,760
slowing that process down because with a

1035
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:26,650
lot of rosin if you leave it out it will

1036
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,360
naturally tend to auto butter you're

1037
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,570
gonna get that separation it kind of

1038
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,130
sweats so it depends on the strain it

1039
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:36,220
depends on the material all kind of the

1040
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:38,110
the the short answer is storage can

1041
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:41,439
probably have a huge effect on how well

1042
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:43,329
the separation slows way down we tend to

1043
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,829
have customers telling us that when

1044
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:46,690
they're doing it right that their shell

1045
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,789
stability is somewhere in the realm of

1046
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,250
two to three months if they're using

1047
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:52,929
those techniques if you leave it out at

1048
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,820
room temperature if you're leaving it in

1049
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:56,710
a non airtight container it could I mean

1050
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,019
24 hours big-big can auto butter

1051
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,269
sometimes so and then the strain itself

1052
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:03,699
again I think that oils more down to the

1053
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:05,170
terpene content within it and what kind

1054
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:09,000
of textures you can have available to

1055
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,000
you other questions

1056
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,230
what would you say in general are the

1057
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:19,170
best strains to put through one of your

1058
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:22,139
pieces of equipment yep so the component

1059
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:24,840
at the baseline more resin higher

1060
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:26,879
potencies gonna there's more to work

1061
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,970
with there when you're making rosin so

1062
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,800
again grill glue almost a little played

1063
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:34,559
out at this point people still love it

1064
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,620
huge producer a lot of the chem strains

1065
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,599
really really do well chem dogs there's

1066
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,579
there's a million back crosses in the

1067
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,619
chem strain one of the one of the

1068
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,329
companies that we work with a lot Oney C

1069
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:46,739
code Tropicana cookies there's some

1070
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:49,380
fruity strains that work really really

1071
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,849
well Crockett's farm some people might

1072
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:54,360
be familiar with them strong Nana

1073
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:57,029
there's some fruity strains I wish I had

1074
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:00,720
a more specific answer about the exact

1075
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:02,910
terpene profile that some companies have

1076
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,189
latched on to that they know overperform

1077
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:06,509
I was given the explanation once but it

1078
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,059
kind of fell right through my head

1079
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:11,550
because it was super high level but

1080
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:13,710
basically you're very resinous high

1081
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,539
yielding high potency plants are always

1082
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,119
going to be typically over performers

1083
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:20,869
when it comes to making solvent listen

1084
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,869
right now we got time for one more

1085
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,329
covered everything well if you're Eric

1086
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:34,840
thank you very much

1087
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:34,840
[Applause]
