2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:11,089
pain and chronic illness are so dynamic

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,798
that they injure us on multiple levels

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:15,449
certainly there is the obvious pain and

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,059
suffering that comes with chronic

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,579
illness for those we use cannabis and

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,169
other herbs and medicines but then there

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,179
are the other injuries from not being

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,220
able to work or perhaps play with our

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,368
kids or be intimate with our lover

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,528
those are injurious to our soul our zest

12
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,600
for life that last one

13
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,729
feeling so broken that we cannot manage

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,420
to rise up and Express sexually with our

15
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:40,468
partners can be incredibly soul-crushing

16
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,870
sometimes it leaves us feeling very

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,390
lonely and ashamed and I know cuz I've

18
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,729
been there after both my accidents I was

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,820
so broken that while cannabis helped the

20
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:53,698
pain my inability to move properly made

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,378
me feel like a broken man that's why

22
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:57,329
we're doing this show today because I

23
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,939
work with cannabis patients every day

24
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,308
and I know of the internalized emotional

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,188
pain that comes from being vibrant and

26
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:07,739
energetic inside with an inability to

27
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,819
actually perform on the outside it

28
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,819
totally sucks

29
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,978
but maybe this episode can help there

30
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,809
are solutions for these challenges

31
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,239
you'll need an open mind but there are

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,159
indeed best practices to be learned so

33
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,500
that you can have fulfilling intimacy

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,350
and sex even if your human body is

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,269
suffering if you want to learn about

36
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:28,828

00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,270
podcast perhaps better known as pleasure

at pleasure mechanics calm today's show

62
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,320
is going to be something special

63
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,180
during the first set we will discuss the

64
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,949
mental and emotional challenges of

65
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,770
having sex while experiencing chronic

66
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:29,329
pain or chronic disease the second set

67
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,500
is all about interacting with your

68
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,270
partner and how to communicate

69
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,189
effectively when either you or your

70
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,200
partner or perhaps both of you are

71
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:38,150
suffering from a debilitating ailment

72
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,489
and in the third set we will talk very

73
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,500
specifically about sexual positions toys

74
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,659
and some creative strategies for

75
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,379
sexualizing your everyday life even in

76
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:50,000
pain as you can imagine today's episode

77
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:52,460
is probably not one to listen to with

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,889
your kids in the car while most podcast

79
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,990
distributors give our show and explicit

80
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,549
rating due to cannabis we are really

81
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,850
going to earn that explicit rating today

82
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,800
welcome to the show Chris it's such a

83
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,479
pleasure thank you for having me

84
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,790
I'm really grateful for you sharing your

85
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,949
valuable time with us and your life loss

86
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:11,929
lifelong experience on this really

87
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:12,469
important topic so so let's get right

88
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,590
into it

89
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:17,840
so many pain patients feel alone in

90
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,580
their suffering because you know most

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,490
folks just don't usually talk about

92
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,560
sexual difficulty at all let's start out

93
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,469
by getting everybody in the same boat

94
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,090
and feeling less isolated you know it's

95
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:31,609
it's pretty do you find it that it's

96
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,879
pretty common that painful injury or

97
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:38,450
disease inhibits a person expressing

98
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,509
their sexuality mm-hmm I mean yes yes

99
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:43,909
and yes all right I'm finding the human

100
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:45,560
condition in this human culture inhibits

101
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:48,049
us from expressing our human sexuality

102
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,920
and that's kind of the thing is we're in

103
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:55,280
a sex negative pleasure phobic culture

104
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,669
to begin with and a culture that has a

105
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,750
very narrow window of what it tells us

106
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:06,099
is sexually permissible and for who and

107
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,580
so when something like illness or injury

108
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:12,379
whether it's temporary or chronic

109
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,170
strikes us when our lives change

110
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:17,389
dramatically and things we have their

111
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:21,560
light on our whole lives our identities

112
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:24,289
change sometimes non-consensual II

113
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,329
sometimes very dramatically our

114
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,620
sexuality is one of those things that

115
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,399
gets thrown in

116
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,500
to such dramatic upheaval and yet we

117
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:35,479
don't have a lot of support for it we

118
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,879
don't have an occupational therapist to

119
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,680
help us get back on track very many of

120
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,829
us don't even have friends we can talk

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:48,530
to you honestly about it and so when

122
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:51,859
change strikes our lives in any way and

123
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:55,250
we have to allow change in our sexual

124
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:01,100
lives this can be a moment of such huge

125
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:03,319
disruption shame guilt fear shutdown

126
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,080
because our options that we wants relied

127
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,209
on or no longer available to us yes this

128
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,740
is huge it's huge for all of us kind of

129
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:11,449
no matter and that's why you know I've

130
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,360
been doing this work my whole life and I

131
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,909
will be doing it till I die because

132
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,220
sexuality isn't easy for any of us for

133
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,740
any of us even you know some of my

134
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,639
coaching clients are quite literally

135
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:29,300
supermodels it's not easy for them and

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,280
so if complications are thrown at us or

137
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:36,139
changes are thrown at us it's especially

138
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:40,119
not easy but but change is also a moment

139
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:43,189
of possible transformation of growth of

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,560
curiosity and so it can also I think as

141
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:49,310
a lot of us discover when illness or

142
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,410
pain comes into our lives it can have

143
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,110
strange blessings to it as well it can

144
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,939
have strange silver linings and this is

145
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,310
especially I think true and sexuality

146
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,560
because it's an opportunity to get to

147
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,848
know ourselves again to get to discover

148
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,240
something about ourselves and our

149
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:07,250
partner to meet one another anew so

150
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,949
that's how I approach it is with both

151
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,009
holding the full complexity of this

152
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:15,110
conversation and also honoring all the

153
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:17,089
potential that is here with us the

154
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,069
pleasure and the joy and the love and

155
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:21,469
connection that sexuality is designed to

156
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:24,199
give us so the question becomes how to

157
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,360
access that one of the things I've

158
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,288
learned from working with pain patients

159
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,330
is that so often the life decisions they

160
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:33,709
have to make because now they are

161
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:36,620
injured or they've been given a

162
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:38,629
diagnosis means that that not only do

163
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,370
they have the pain and the diagnosis but

164
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:42,439
they also have to do other things maybe

165
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,970
have to move into a less expensive

166
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,709
apartment or maybe they have to move

167
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,340
back with her family for goodness sakes

168
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:50,149
and and it's so challenging I would

169
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:54,198
imagine

170
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:56,269
because not only do you have this trauma

171
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,509
that has happened and now you have this

172
00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:01,789
this pain experience but also at the

173
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,579
same time you're trying to do these

174
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:09,020
important interactions with with your

175
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:11,000
partner and and it's like it's like it's

176
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:12,500
like so it's not super easy for most

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,668
people to talk about their sexuality

178
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,439
even at the best of times and and and to

179
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:21,228
be in a place where you're experiencing

180
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:24,610
so much pain and need to go through this

181
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:28,879
this significant vulnerable and growing

182
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,800
time with your partner it's like oh man

183
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,199
this is the worst time for me to even

184
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,478
try to be open with my partner and try

185
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,210
to you know grow emotionally to where I

186
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,219
need to be to do that mmm well that's

187
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,259
one perspective on it I want to offer a

188
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,180
few others and I also want to say going

189
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,819
into this conversation

190
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,370
I want all bodies to feel included in

191
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,649
this and we need to honor that illness

192
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,319
and injury is such a huge spectrum of

193
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:56,449
how it impacts our bodies what it gives

194
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,478
us to work with what it takes away from

195
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:02,389
us some things are temporary but what

196
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:05,060
all of us have in common just from being

197
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,949
humans is change so that's what I really

198
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,019
want to come back to over and over again

199
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,180
because also even if you have a terminal

200
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:15,198
diagnosis there's gonna be a thousand

201
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,538
changes along the way and so so much of

202
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,210
this becomes dancing with change and

203
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,939
allowing change and changing our

204
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:25,219
attitudes and that's the other theme I

205
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:28,788
want to weave in here is allowing our

206
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,139
attitudes about sex to change and one of

207
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,279
the attitudes I want to just bring up

208
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,269
right away as you keep mentioning

209
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,259
partners our first and foremost

210
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:39,799
relationship and our sexualities with

211
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:42,110
ourselves and whether or not you have

212
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,879
one partner many partners no partners

213
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,810
for the foreseeable future you have a

214
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,610
sexuality and so as we talk about

215
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:51,529
sexuality I want to talk about our

216
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,169
relationships with ourselves how we feel

217
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:57,049
about our bodies what we desire what we

218
00:08:54,169 --> 00:09:00,349
allow for ourselves and how we meet

219
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:02,708
another person naked in bed right his

220
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,480
sexuality lives in all of those spaces

221
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:08,359
so let's talk about that relationship

222
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,050
with our own body because you know

223
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:16,659
having been a pain patient myself I know

224
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:20,479
that after my car accident my body fell

225
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:23,379
foreign to me and it was acting in ways

226
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,110
that I had not experienced before and

227
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:28,399
and you know there luckily I have two

228
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,778
pretty good headspace about my

229
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,578
relationship with my body but there were

230
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,259
certainly times that I was angry and I

231
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:34,969
felt like my body was letting me down

232
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:36,769
even though it was doing everything a

233
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,199
good to heal

234
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:42,440
since our primary relationship with

235
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:44,389
sexuality is with ourselves what kind of

236
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,089
advice do you have to offer people who

237
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:49,549
feel that you know maybe their their

238
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,620
body has become diseased and is selling

239
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:55,219
them out and so it becomes an

240
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,320
adversarial relationship totally there

241
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,680
can be a sense of betrayal there can be

242
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,820
a sense of grief for what was lost there

243
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:06,198
can be in a sense of anger like why me

244
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:11,240
and this is especially true if you've

245
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:13,578
been able bodied um athletes or soldiers

246
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,970
I've talked to who have been able-bodied

247
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:20,778
and used their body as a tool that could

248
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,699
be relied upon right and even dialed in

249
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:24,139
their body for optimal fitness right

250
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:27,819
like the we all carry different

251
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:30,620
relationships going into our illness so

252
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,660
when you wake up many of us we wake up

253
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,320
in a hospital bed we emerge into this

254
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:37,789
new condition we're diagnosed first you

255
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,129
have to really go through all of that

256
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:43,309
[ __ ] you have to be real with the anger

257
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:46,850
you have to be honest with the grief and

258
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:49,219
then try to find the mental space of

259
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:53,540
asking okay what now what next what's

260
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,500
possible and also remembering that will

261
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:59,179
change so my own kind of health crisis

262
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,698
when I woke up in so much pain there can

263
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:05,120
be such a sense of will it be this way

264
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:07,399
forever and that breeds despair right

265
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,610
like why why would I even try my

266
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,730
sexuality has been taken

267
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,899
from me I'll never love again like we

268
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,060
can have these sense of just complete

269
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,309
betrayal and despair from our bodies

270
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,469
it's usually not true and sometimes we

271
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,208
need friendly faces or voices telling us

272
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,550
that's not true things will change

273
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:27,299
you're still worthy and lovable people

274
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:28,379
will still find you desirable that can

275
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:32,309
be more or less hard to believe

276
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:34,259
depending on your circumstances but even

277
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,389
again with yourself a sexuality as

278
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,909
possible pleasure as possible joining

279
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:41,278
connection as possible kind of no matter

280
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:43,828
what and you and I know this but from

281
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,870
working with people in terminal

282
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:50,129
conditions at end of life after

283
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:52,679
disfiguring accidents pleasure joy love

284
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:56,220
all of these things that we want out of

285
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,049
sex are still available to us so maybe

286
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,360
it's my voice reminding of you of this

287
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:02,609
for the first time or a friend sitting

288
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,720
with you at the bedside or your partner

289
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:09,870
still looking at you with love desire

290
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,339
wanting even if that wanting has changed

291
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,269
right so Charlotte and I were together

292
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,339
for a decade before I got sick our one

293
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:19,889
ting used to be feisty and playful and

294
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,410
full of passion and lust and like I want

295
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,149
to tear your clothes off and do nasty

296
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,219
things to you right now that wanting

297
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,759
changed who I want you to be alive with

298
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,028
me I want you to take your next breath

299
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:35,879
but that wanting was deeply romantic too

300
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:36,958
because we let ourselves feel it so so

301
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,838
much of this is going to go back to

302
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,819
feeling letting yourself feeling letting

303
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,190
yourself feel what you feel in the

304
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,320
moment being real with it and then

305
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,300
trying to have a sense of agency of what

306
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,690
you want to feel next what do you want

307
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:54,419
to experience next what is possible for

308
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,220
you given your condition you might have

309
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:57,689
pain for the rest of your life great how

310
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,820
are you gonna have a sexuality with pain

311
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,290
in the back seat that's now your

312
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,310
question and a lot of this is about

313
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:06,778
context we forget sometimes how

314
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:10,698
context-dependent our sexualities are

315
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:13,559
and if your context is now the

316
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:15,479
ground-level bedroom at your parents

317
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,250
house that's a very different erotic

318
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,829
context than your own apartment in the

319
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,528
city yeah how are you gonna make it work

320
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:25,649
that's gonna take curiosity

321
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:31,679
creativity courage commitment practice

322
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:33,688
iteration mistakes but it's possible and

323
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:38,448
if you know it's possible and you start

324
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:41,370
asking that question it can be array of

325
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:42,990
warmth and pleasure admits all of the

326
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,259
rest of the horror your life has become

327
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:51,509
for the moment it can become a thread

328
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:53,188
you follow back towards a new life and

329
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:55,139
that also reminds me half we can't ask

330
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:58,379
the question when will normal come back

331
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,720
when will I get my old body back after

332
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:04,680
change you never go back

333
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,509
you always go forward these these ideas

334
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,388
that these ideas that you're talking

335
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:12,389
about being open to change and to be

336
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:14,999
willing to change the context of your

337
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:18,990
sexuality that seems like that would be

338
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:20,759
the same path out of you know the the

339
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,899
feelings of depression that normally

340
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:27,629
come with pain as well you know we we

341
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,789
there's there's this initial shock when

342
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:32,879
suddenly the pain arrives or or if it

343
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:34,919
pains the pain comes slowly sometimes it

344
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:39,120
hits you when you get like a fin

345
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:42,028
official diagnosis but not only does the

346
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,269
pain itself like that I don't want to

347
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:48,360
perform in this way because it hurts but

348
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:51,209
then there's also this this depression

349
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,688
that comes along with it where it's like

350
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:58,588
like damn I'm broken and I'm never going

351
00:14:54,688 --> 00:15:01,558
to be happy and love again and that can

352
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:03,480
be so heavy independently that you know

353
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:06,058
some people are so depressed that they

354
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,860
lose a will to express their sexuality

355
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:09,480
just because they're depressed and they

356
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,818
don't even have the pain and my heart

357
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,938
goes out to those folks too but it

358
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:17,250
sounds like they they both share this

359
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:22,049
this pathway out that you're describing

360
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:26,339
of essentially releasing the definitions

361
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:28,919
of what our society tells us is that is

362
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,769
this the pretty strict bandwidth of

363
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,948
where sexuality lives and and it doesn't

364
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,448
have to be that that's small of an area

365
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:38,008
mmm totally and you know we

366
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:42,778
people using the word pain it can be

367
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:44,220
also nausea it can be mental fog there's

368
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:47,249
a lot of things that can come with

369
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:50,839
illness or injury lifestyle changes

370
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:53,189
health changes that impact our sexuality

371
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,119
pain is kind of a short word for all of

372
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:59,578
them because they're all a pain in the

373
00:15:54,119 --> 00:16:03,019
ass embracing this change totally so

374
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:05,909
much of it is about scripts and

375
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:08,068
recognizing that our sexuality is for a

376
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:10,858
lot of us for a lot of our lives have

377
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:13,759
been very dependent on identity based

378
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:16,980
scripts that tell us what we should do

379
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,889
usually as men and as women what people

380
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,739
want of us what successful sex looks

381
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:26,668
like what sex even means what it is what

382
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:30,209
activities it involves and it's kind of

383
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:31,828
shocking especially if you're not queer

384
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,868
if you haven't already spent a lot of

385
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:35,969
time opening up your sexuality and your

386
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,918
sexual attitudes when you start looking

387
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,678
at it you realize what a narrow script

388
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:43,558
most of us are operating in and what it

389
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:46,769
should zhan us like the shooting on us

390
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:49,528
is and I use that kind of intentionally

391
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:51,239
as almost like a nasty verb because

392
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:53,850
that's how it feels what does a man

393
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:57,059
should like what should a man do in bed

394
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,100
what should a woman do in bed how should

395
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:02,238
a man feel and for a lot of us these

396
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,068
gendered scripts tell us a man should be

397
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:07,288
the active initiator the one that gets

398
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:09,509
on top and thrusts the one that

399
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:13,828
initiates with you know a rock-hard

400
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:17,068
penis at any moment a woman should be

401
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:21,388
desirable she should be able to receive

402
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:23,338
penetration she should be wet and it

403
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:26,009
turns out none of these actually align

404
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:28,369
with our lived experience of sexuality

405
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:32,269
none of them align with the human

406
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:35,879
physiology and mechanics of sex and

407
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:38,909
there's so much more available to us

408
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,120
beyond the script and so this is the

409
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:43,710
liberation that's possible when all of

410
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,018
us that in our script is burned in the

411
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,840
bonfire of life and we're like holy [ __ ]

412
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,039
what am I left with my dick doesn't work

413
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,019
or it doesn't

414
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,940
stay hard long enough my [ __ ] doesn't

415
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:57,839
want to be penetrated anymore do you

416
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,360
want softer words realizing no I think I

417
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,069
mean we're already okay the show and

418
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,659
we're we're we're Network we count as

419
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:07,919
explicit so I guess we're just kind of

420
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:11,580
earning it today my body doesn't want to

421
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,590
be penetrated anymore or as often

422
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,139
I am tired all the time right like these

423
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:19,139
changes that come that throw our scripts

424
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:23,730
in the fire what are you left with and

425
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:26,370
this is the kind of deep inner work that

426
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,829
we get to do not that we have to do that

427
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:31,829
we get to do when we have big changes in

428
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:34,649
life that reveal so much about ourselves

429
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:37,529
that we reveal what is left of our

430
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,930
desire when the scripts get tossed out

431
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:44,339
the window what actually is possible

432
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:47,789
from these two bodies right now as is I

433
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,470
was on another podcast disability after

434
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,990
dark which is another great resource to

435
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,519
check out especially for folks who get

436
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:57,539
thrown into kind of major life

437
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,490
disabilities and Andrew and I boiled it

438
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:02,909
down to like we end up being just two

439
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,890
bodies in a room together asking you

440
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,470
know what do you want how can I please

441
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,630
you how can I serve you and that is such

442
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,519
a beautiful place to be with another

443
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,380
human being when all the [ __ ] is

444
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,200
stripped away when there's just this

445
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,600
urgency of life and of time which is

446
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,880
also another gift of disease gives us is

447
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:26,730
we have an urgency of life again and

448
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,940
from the hot place the homeless pleasure

449
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,430
is possible human bodies and I know this

450
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,380
is you know a polymorphous queer person

451
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,960
who is [ __ ] and been [ __ ] by all

452
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,180
sorts of bodies human bodies can fit

453
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,400
together in all sorts of ways and

454
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:46,380
pleasure one another in all sorts of

455
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,900
ways and we don't need anyone specific

456
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,950
you know capability or ability to engage

457
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:55,160
with that some of the most beautiful

458
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,710
lovers and kinkiest people I've known

459
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:01,950
have had the most limitations and the

460
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,450
most creativity and willingness to play

461
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,220
with one another

462
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:09,778
so I don't know I just really want to

463
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,798
like have the attitude of because I

464
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:13,829
can't perform

465
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,558
sorry bumped my mic I think what is

466
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:18,678
essential here is confronting the

467
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,599
attitude that tells us all is lost

468
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,179
you'll never love again it'll never be

469
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,740
the same therefore there's nothing to

470
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:29,250
look forward to you know that despair

471
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,740
does not help us heal it doesn't help us

472
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,259
manage our pain it doesn't help us

473
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,970
connect with our current lover or

474
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:40,888
partners we want to be engaged with

475
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:44,579
right like a despair is not useful for

476
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:46,949
very long it can be a very temporary

477
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,829
state to kind of languish in for a while

478
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,110
and feel it fully grieve what has been

479
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:54,538
lost and then if you're gonna choose to

480
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:57,058
continue living the question has to be

481
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:57,778
what next what now what do I want to

482
00:20:57,058 --> 00:20:59,879
experience

483
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:02,130
well then let's let's talk about that

484
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:09,330
that place at the beginning because you

485
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:12,169
know when well I after my accident you

486
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:14,548
know after I got over the initial

487
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:17,159
awareness that I had been in an accident

488
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:20,009
and I had a brain injury and I was in a

489
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,409
lot of pain and experienced a lot of

490
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:23,908
exhaustion and you know there was the

491
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:27,090
firt I don't even really remember the

492
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:30,380
first three weeks after it I just kind

493
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:34,199
of I disappeared and from from everybody

494
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:37,950
and I mostly just slept and and when I

495
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:44,750
really came to grips with the reality of

496
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:48,990
my life I felt scared and alone and so I

497
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:51,019
called up my partner at the time and and

498
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,159
and I said hey you know I know I've been

499
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,450
missing but I told her I wanted I'd love

500
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,490
to get together with her and we got

501
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:02,308
together and and you know it touching

502
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:06,599
led to lovemaking and suddenly the

503
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:08,819
vertigo was there and and the like you

504
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:13,500
were talking about the male role earlier

505
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:16,619
as I was going through traditional male

506
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,420
roles leave it bet that I got really

507
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:20,000
dizzy

508
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,779
and I and I and and I was above her and

509
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,289
and this combination of feeling dizzy

510
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:30,170
and swooning and kind of falling to the

511
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:32,000
side at the same time I realized what

512
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,880
was happening and what this meant for my

513
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,880
life and I started crying and then I'm

514
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,690
realizing that oh my gosh I'm injured

515
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,510
and I'm crying what a disappointing guy

516
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:48,860
right it all builds up yeah fast right

517
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:52,099
in the moment and you know luckily I am

518
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:55,669
a you know I'm a I'm a pretty vulnerable

519
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:57,649
speaker anyway and so so I was able to

520
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,220
speak with her about what was going on

521
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:04,280
for me and I'm grateful for that but but

522
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:07,240
for people who are at that place and

523
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:09,589
their self-worth is so diminished

524
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,470
because of whatever this health

525
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:13,970
challenges that they're dealing with you

526
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,579
know it takes a certain amount of

527
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,230
self-worth or Moxie to start down this

528
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:19,939
path you're talking about right you know

529
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,339
being vulnerable and recontextualizing

530
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,480
sexuality for oneself that's not really

531
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:30,769
easy work so so what would you say the

532
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,930
baby steps are in in concrete terms for

533
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:36,500
somebody who realizes that they're here

534
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:39,980
but they are emotionally ready to change

535
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:43,880
it yes well thank you for sharing that

536
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:46,160
story because it encapsulates so much so

537
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,360
much of our moments when I say you know

538
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,160
our scripts have gone in the fire

539
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,990
fuck'em I say that with a certain amount

540
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,790
of queer irreverence but I also say that

541
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,190
knowing that our scripts are deeply

542
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:58,670
comforting they are what have told us

543
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:03,410
that we have value that we belong that

544
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:06,350
we are wanted and when we think about

545
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:09,320
that moment of you know seeing your

546
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:12,649
lover again and conversation leading to

547
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:15,259
kissing leading to lovemaking the heart

548
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:18,080
of what's going connect and you're

549
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:22,670
trying to establish like we can still do

550
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:24,439
this right and the question that has to

551
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,210
be asked is like what is the this we are

552
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,960
still trying to do and what is the new

553
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,370
way we are going to do it and this

554
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,038
starts with

555
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:36,528
this starts with communicating about sex

556
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:39,950
and I want to say again like this step

557
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:41,210
of changing our erotic lives can happen

558
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,749
with or without illness with or without

559
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,669
disease but the more loaded your life is

560
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:49,370
the harder this is the more pieces that

561
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:51,440
you can control right you're not doing

562
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:54,168
this erotic transformation under the

563
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,149
best of circumstances you're a little

564
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:58,490
bit transforming under duress so there's

565
00:24:56,148 --> 00:25:02,109
a lot of self compassion that has to

566
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:05,329
come into play here and patience and

567
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:10,128
just baby stepping into it so some of

568
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:12,249
this is like taking stock of what this

569
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:16,158
situation is right what is your body

570
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:21,409
capable of right now how has your body

571
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:23,210
changed and that process can take months

572
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:25,460
and again like changes can happen so

573
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:29,090
quickly in illness that this has to be

574
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,798
an ongoing process in mindfulness we

575
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:32,569
have one of our courses is mindful sex

576
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,480
which I actually developed while I was

577
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:38,569
sick and healing because the way I

578
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,788
managed my pain and my rapidly changing

579
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:43,808
body was so much with my mindfulness

580
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:46,940
training I had from ten years earlier

581
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:48,980
and so much of that is about paying

582
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:53,210
attention moment to moment without

583
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:56,118
judgment right really easy to say hard

584
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,980
to do but it's an essential practice

585
00:25:56,118 --> 00:26:00,589
when we're sick because we have to pay

586
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,860
attention to our bodies a lot of us have

587
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:06,019
to track our symptoms that becomes kind

588
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:07,849
of a superpower over time where we get

589
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:10,548
to know our bodies really well we can

590
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:13,189
talk about that later but the first step

591
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:16,548
and of taking stock where's my body at

592
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:19,070
what can I feel what capabilities do I

593
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:22,368
have do I not have and how different

594
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:23,808
does my sex life need to look because

595
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:26,058
for some of us the changes will be

596
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:28,548
subtle but really profound for others of

597
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:30,558
us it's completely different the

598
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:31,999
activities and positions and

599
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,359
interactions we are used to are no

600
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:38,509
longer available and that might take

601
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,579
some really serious creativity bringing

602
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:43,099
in toys you've never even heard of to

603
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:45,529
assist you in having the experiences you

604
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:48,199
want but all of this starts with

605
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:49,789
sation either with yourself first right

606
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,190
you're lying in bed you're trying to

607
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:54,019
heal and you're like all right body what

608
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,259
do we have what do we have to work with

609
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:59,480
what desires are there because your

610
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:01,430
desires might have also changed the sex

611
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,160
like you used to have might be even like

612
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:07,009
not even thinkable to you going out to

613
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,200
the club dancing picking up girls if

614
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:12,019
that was your sex like before it might

615
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,970
not even be possible anymore if you used

616
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:17,569
to make love to your wife four times a

617
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:19,610
week that might not even be on your mind

618
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,429
right and I'm curious with you and your

619
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:25,729
process like as sexuality got on your

620
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:28,430
mind was it about will I belong will I

621
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,620
be lovable will I be dateable will I be

622
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,090
alone or was it about like when's the

623
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:35,000
next time I'm gonna be able to have sex

624
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:36,709
like we need to stop thinking about sex

625
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,789
as this package deal and start realizing

626
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,420
how much we get out of sex physical

627
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:44,299
touch

628
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,259
perfection for me it was about about not

629
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:50,180
mattering anymore because you know how

630
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:53,390
our sexuality and how we present

631
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,740
ourselves about about sex like gives

632
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:59,150
people an impression about what our

633
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:02,809
thoughts are about sex and and and for

634
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:06,700
me it was like have I made myself no

635
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:11,029
longer relevant to the saucy you know

636
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,250
sexy people who I identified with when I

637
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:14,930
was that age and granted I was going out

638
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,759
to clubs and things more at that time

639
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:19,100
and you know since my brain injury

640
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:23,390
III stopped going out to clubs and

641
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:27,529
entirely and I it was is my feelings of

642
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:30,230
being irrelevant and and that's scary

643
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:33,170
right when when somebody perceives

644
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,210
themselves as being you know going to

645
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,039
art openings and going to restaurant

646
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,900
openings and you know getting to all go

647
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,649
all the cool stuff and then realizing

648
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,900
that you know I'm in a lot of pain and I

649
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,420
can barely walk and I get overstimulated

650
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:51,200
and am I really just gonna be at home

651
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:53,150
sitting here alone forever and a lot of

652
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,830
this is about the modeling we have for

653
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,870
sick and disabled people which frankly

654
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:59,178
sucks and so I also encourage people to

655
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:02,148
start following and fee

656
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:05,839
like their social media feeds with the

657
00:29:02,148 --> 00:29:08,658
disability justice community who talk

658
00:29:05,838 --> 00:29:10,249
and speak about their bodies with

659
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:12,289
respect and reverence and honor no

660
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:16,190
matter what it's a beautiful community

661
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:19,128
to learn a lot from but that thing of

662
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:21,200
belonging right and I was with Charlotte

663
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:23,388
for ten years we had been sex educators

664
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,538
we were like committed to eros as a

665
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:30,348
spiritual path I got sick and I was like

666
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:33,858
go on without me leave me find a better

667
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:37,398
lover you know and that self deprecating

668
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:40,428
I am worthless now that is our

669
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:43,248
internalized ableism speaking that is

670
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:45,409
our culture telling us you are no longer

671
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:48,108
valuable you are no longer worthy you

672
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:50,929
are no longer lovable and it's just not

673
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:52,939
true and hopefully the people in your

674
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:56,179
life will start showing you that showing

675
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:59,239
you how deeply lovable you are no matter

676
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:01,339
what if not start surrounding yourself

677
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:04,460
hopefully with people who can reflect

678
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:06,528
that back to you my ice just linked

679
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,358
hopefully we're surround yourself with

680
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:09,798
people who can reflect that to you but

681
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:12,678
ultimately this is a gift we give

682
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:15,858
ourselves we find our worthiness again

683
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,919
and again this is about identity the

684
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:20,808
things that we identified with our

685
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,499
communities that we felt a part of that

686
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:27,168
we found joy and belonging with may not

687
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:29,598
be accessible to us part of that is on

688
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:31,820
that community to be more accessible and

689
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:34,189
inclusive but it's also part of is like

690
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:37,398
our desires might shift as you said your

691
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:40,489
love of music might transform from going

692
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:42,678
to festivals to listening deeply at home

693
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:46,548
with headphones on to totally blissed

694
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:51,729
out your desire for nature might change

695
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:54,348
from surfing to sitting on the shore

696
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:56,359
meditating right like how does your body

697
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:58,038
now fit with your pleasures and your

698
00:30:56,358 --> 00:30:59,928
desires this is going to be the

699
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:03,019
adventure of a lifetime to figure out as

700
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:04,909
your body continues to change but I

701
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:08,569
think what we know from people who are

702
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:12,940
ill even with terminal cancers even with

703
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:14,470
persistent pain that would you know the

704
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,330
pain patients here all the times like I

705
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,159
just can't imagine living that way it's

706
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:21,460
like well if the option is death you get

707
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:25,179
used to a lot and our bodies are so

708
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,308
resilient and adaptive that eroticism

709
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:29,409
and sexuality can be a part of that how

710
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:31,868
will your sexuality adapt how do your

711
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:34,179
attitudes need to change and that's

712
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:36,788
where it starts for so many of us I get

713
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:39,099
emails every day about the struggles and

714
00:31:36,788 --> 00:31:40,898
people want the solution but what

715
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:43,358
happens if we swim upstream to the

716
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:45,158
attitude that is generating that

717
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:47,798
experience of the struggle that is

718
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:49,599
telling you that because your penis is

719
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:52,598
in hard sex is impossible

720
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:55,598
well let's swim upstream change that

721
00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:57,428
attitude show you what sex is possible

722
00:31:55,598 --> 00:32:00,908
and then you can choose from the menu of

723
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:03,129
delights right changing our attitudes

724
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:07,210
because frankly our sexual attitudes are

725
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:09,579
just really really toxic in this culture

726
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,590
so we all need to do this work but when

727
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:13,358
we do it through this lens of change and

728
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:16,388
transformation in order to give

729
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:20,249
ourselves the joy of sex back in our

730
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:22,628
lives it's really a gift to ourselves

731
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:24,700
and I really want to remind people this

732
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:27,638
doesn't have to look even like partnered

733
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,558
sexuality like if you are facing a

734
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:31,538
terminal illness you're errata sysm

735
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:34,628
might look like a lot of solo time in

736
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:37,690
nature taking deep joy and pleasure out

737
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:41,769
of that time that might be your erotic

738
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:43,840
expression it's really variable but

739
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:47,589
what's important is that it's yours and

740
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:50,558
on your terms so I've got one more path

741
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:52,959
I want to take on this idea of our

742
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,598
relationship with our self first before

743
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,798
we go to our first commercial and during

744
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,348
the second set we'll talk a lot more

745
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:00,608
about vulnerability and communication

746
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:02,019
with other people but I think it's I

747
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:05,048
think it's really important that we get

748
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:08,319
that relationship with ourselves good

749
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:11,138
and grounded first and that's this you

750
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:15,098
know if you go to the extreme if you go

751
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:17,678
beyond just the pain and then just the

752
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:20,289
depression and then just the diminished

753
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,780
self-worth if you continue that

754
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:26,649
there are people who have gotten to a

755
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:28,569
point that performing sexually under

756
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:32,470
duress of pain in the bed in the bedroom

757
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:35,230
can be is so bad that people begin to

758
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:38,289
form negative associations around sex

759
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:42,120
generally so far what you and I've been

760
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:46,990
talking about there seems to assume some

761
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:50,019
some seed of wanting to be sexual again

762
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:53,620
right and we know that sexuality is is

763
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:56,170
part of an overall healthy human you

764
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:57,759
know makeup and life experience what

765
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,490
kind of insight would you have to offer

766
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:05,500
with people who have felt like this for

767
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:08,159
so long that that sexuality or the

768
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,599
expression of it has become like a

769
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:15,299
contrast for them a conflict it's the

770
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:19,900
enemy and and and though they know that

771
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,460
it might be good for them mm-hmm the

772
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,190
word that really stuck out in your

773
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:27,010
question was performance to perform

774
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:31,750
under duress that sounds miserable for

775
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:33,040
anyone in any arena and so much of sex

776
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,429
again when we're talking about scripts

777
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,409
you perform a script and we have been

778
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:42,550
taught that sex is a performance and you

779
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:44,469
do it well or you fail you are a sex God

780
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,330
or you're a total loser right like we

781
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:50,619
are taught that sex is a performance

782
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:53,049
that you get a grade on sex is something

783
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:56,409
we experience through our bodies through

784
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:59,530
our beings right we can stop performing

785
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:01,719
sex and start being sexual beings and

786
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,000
again this isn't just like you know cute

787
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:08,469
language for Instagram this is really an

788
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,719
important attitude shift where if the

789
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:13,089
question is not can I perform sex

790
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,039
tonight according to a script and I have

791
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:18,370
to hit these certain marks in order to

792
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,230
be successful if the question is what do

793
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:23,139
I want to experience what is my body

794
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:25,300
capable of what's available to me how

795
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:29,079
can I serve you how can I pleasure you

796
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:33,940
if you have a partner then you have an

797
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:36,909
open-ended path to take together

798
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,530
and it's so important to remind people

799
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:41,949
of this because so much of that not

800
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:46,630
tonight honey or dodging sex or avoiding

801
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:49,629
the rejection cycle comes out of this if

802
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:52,030
I initiate sex we have to do X Y &amp; Z and

803
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,769
it's a package deal and if your body

804
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,019
isn't feeling like being kind of traded

805
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:57,909
and your husband initiates sex it's so

806
00:35:56,019 --> 00:36:01,480
much easier to be like nope not

807
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:04,598
available then to communicate well I'm

808
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:08,829
not really available for penetration but

809
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,780
X Y &amp; Z sounds good and let's see after

810
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:12,940
the foot massage right let's start with

811
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:16,119
the 10-minute foot massage see how that

812
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,579
makes me feel and know that there's no

813
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,930
pressure to continue either way and if

814
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:21,849
you want to get off after my foot

815
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:24,129
massage I will watch you as you stroke

816
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:27,338
yourself right but this level of sexual

817
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:30,880
communication is almost unthinkable to

818
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:32,858
most people this level of sexual knowing

819
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,559
of having that ease and fluency of

820
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:37,269
talking about sex is unthinkable so

821
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:40,088
where do we need to start by talking

822
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:42,460
about sex by thinking about sex by

823
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:45,219
getting new ideas so we have a

824
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,650
vocabulary of what might be possible if

825
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:49,419
that intercourse you know a few minutes

826
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:52,289
of oral leading to intercourse script is

827
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,030
no longer available to you what then

828
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:57,849
there is so much available to you and

829
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,480
people like me are here to tell you and

830
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:01,269
root you on

831
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,539
and remind you that you are not alone

832
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:06,579
and in the end that's that's pretty much

833
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:09,670
what the goal I had with this show is

834
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:11,920
because I know that a lot of folks who

835
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:14,559
are not in the best relationships with

836
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,450
their body and who use cannabis for pain

837
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:21,219
or other relief they could probably use

838
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:21,789
hearing this message too so thank you

839
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:23,500

fire I'm your host Shang golos and our

961
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:20,549
guest this week is sex educator Chris

962
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:23,340
Maxwell Rose so as we saw in the first

963
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:25,740
set common challenges to fulfilling sex

964
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:28,590
for pain patients or really anybody who

965
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:31,459
is looking for body relief is often a

966
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,269
blend of emotional and interpersonal

967
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,039
communication and physical issues

968
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:37,679
there's like this is working on a lot of

969
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:40,199
different levels so let's talk next

970
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,539
about the communication aspects because

971
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,669
you know these insights likely work for

972
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,230
anyone who hesitates from talking about

973
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,360
sex at all you don't necessarily have to

974
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,519
be injured but since today we're really

975
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,400
focusing on cannabis patients with

976
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:55,230
chronic pain or other chronic issues

977
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,200
Chris what sort of advice do you give to

978
00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:00,630
folks who want to initiate conversation

979
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,419
with their partner or potential partner

980
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,940
to get them talking about their desires

981
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,809
and physical limitations because so

982
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,210
often it's just

983
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:11,070
oh the getting started part that's so

984
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:14,059
hard you open your mouth and you want

985
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:17,519
sound to come out and and it's hard so

986
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:20,159
where can people start with that mmm

987
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,489
it's such a great question and we need

988
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,329
to remember when we're talking about all

989
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:26,039
communication one of the things we're

990
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:30,900
doing is we're making the invisible

991
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:33,750
visible we are bringing our interior

992
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,490
life outward to be shared and that's can

993
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,800
be vulnerable it can be scary but it's

994
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:39,989
also what makes things possible so I

995
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,230
just want to give you a little bit of

996
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:45,419
cheerleading that while opening up your

997
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,340
mouth and speaking about sex might be

998
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,409
one of the scariest things you do in

999
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:53,700
this process it will also be deeply

1000
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:56,269
rewarding if you stick with it because

1001
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:59,609
part of communicating about sex is

1002
00:43:56,269 --> 00:44:01,980
getting specific we've been talking

1003
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:04,260
about the script we all get kind of this

1004
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,059
cultural download about what sex means

1005
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,610
what it means to be a man or a woman

1006
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:13,230
what it means to be sexy what it means

1007
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:16,260
to be desired a lot of that information

1008
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:19,079
is frankly just wrong or it comes from a

1009
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,780
deeply sex-negative place that's trying

1010
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,880
to very limit your sexual experience so

1011
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,250
what we want to do is open up our minds

1012
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,619
open up our vocabularies

1013
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:35,760
and start getting ideas insights and

1014
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:39,690
operate like options ideas are pathways

1015
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,450
to possibility we need to have that in

1016
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:44,789
order to envision what is possible for

1017
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:46,679
us because if you're a man who's just

1018
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:49,650
gotten a prospect to me and you've lost

1019
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:52,109
your penis function or you're in so much

1020
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,360
lower back pain the idea of thrusting is

1021
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:56,099
just nowhere on the table the question

1022
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:00,870
has become like well then what is

1023
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:04,679
possible communication can start with

1024
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:07,380
listening reading or watching right that

1025
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:09,529
is a form of communication where you are

1026
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,480
starting kind of in the receptive role

1027
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:15,300
there are great podcasts ours is just

1028
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,309
one of them there are books you can read

1029
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,400
we'll try to put some resources together

1030
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:22,590
for you but that can be a really gentle

1031
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,059
way to start as you're lying in bed as

1032
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:27,030
you're going for your healing walks

1033
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:29,039
whatever it is listen to a podcast and

1034
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,110
when there's an episode that resonates

1035
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,730
for you share it share it either with

1036
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:35,400
your intimate partner or even with a

1037
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:38,010
friend and talking about sex with

1038
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,380
friends can be less scary maybe than

1039
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:43,080
talking about it with your partner you

1040
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,820
want to find a zone of safety and when

1041
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,889
I'm talking about safety I'm not talking

1042
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:50,760
about just physical safety from violence

1043
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:52,139
I'm talking about the social safety and

1044
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,910
there's a lot of brain science we can go

1045
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:55,980
in here but I'll keep it simple the

1046
00:45:53,909 --> 00:45:59,129
social safety where you feel connected

1047
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:01,800
and like you belong and you're accepted

1048
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,800
where you can feel calm and interested

1049
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,080
in conversation that's the zone you want

1050
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,330
to try to talk about sex out of if

1051
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:13,739
you're feeling scared and activated and

1052
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:15,299
ashamed and fearful your brain can't

1053
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:18,029
really work you can't really communicate

1054
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,950
well and so that's maybe a signal to you

1055
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:22,590
if you feel that in your body like oh

1056
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:25,230
this is feeling too scary that you want

1057
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,809
to take a baby step back and listen to

1058
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:30,240
some more podcasts or try something

1059
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:33,210
different one of the resources I'll give

1060
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:36,869
to you is episode we did about nonverbal

1061
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:39,769
communication you can write your lover a

1062
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:42,900
letter you can start

1063
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:44,789
choose your own adventure book with your

1064
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,910
lover where you say would you rather

1065
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:50,130
this or that you can listen to a podcast

1066
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:52,649
together walking on the street with

1067
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,630
headphones on and then stop at a bench

1068
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,960
and discuss it and you already have this

1069
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:00,329
whole banquet of language to talk about

1070
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,300
you can print out an article and

1071
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:04,619
highlight a few sentences and just say

1072
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,050
to your lover you know I saw this

1073
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:09,269
article about this thing what do you

1074
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,769
think right you're not saying I want

1075
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:13,320
this will you do it to me

1076
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:14,730
that's a really charged question it's

1077
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,630
just saying what do you think about this

1078
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:20,639
idea but for many of us talking about

1079
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,010
sex is scary because of all the shame

1080
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:26,339
all of the guilt all of the stigma

1081
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,870
associated with sex in general and we're

1082
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,059
on different places with this right like

1083
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:33,359
there's generational issues here there's

1084
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:34,829
cultural differences but you also want

1085
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,789
to get to a place where you can think

1086
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:40,559
and talk about sex on your own even in

1087
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:44,159
your own mind in your own authentic

1088
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:47,849
voice in a way that doesn't start with

1089
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:49,829
shame that doesn't start with fear and

1090
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:52,860
that can take some excavation if you've

1091
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:54,630
learned you know different people have

1092
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,660
different cultural backgrounds that tell

1093
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:00,630
them that sex itself is dirty or that

1094
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:05,369
pleasure during sex is not the goal or

1095
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:08,490
the body should not be seen all sorts of

1096
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:10,199
messages we internalize and sometimes

1097
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:12,000
it's shocking you know what we realize

1098
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:14,759
what we have to kick out of bed like we

1099
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,650
think were really sexy free beings and

1100
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:21,660
then we realized just how constrained we

1101
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:24,300
are by shame or traumas from the past so

1102
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:27,449
a lot of this is again that self inward

1103
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:29,519
stuff of like alright this is going to

1104
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:31,619
be scary to talk about but the truth is

1105
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,380
after an illness and injury a disease

1106
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:35,759
there's so much you need to talk about

1107
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,890
your mobility might have changed your

1108
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,780
diet but probably has to change your

1109
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:41,759
cannabis use might change so you need

1110
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,590
conversations with your lover or your

1111
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,200
partner or the people you're living with

1112
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:47,880
and yourself about all of these things

1113
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:49,949
and sex is just going to be one of them

1114
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,950
and what I find is that a lot of

1115
00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:53,338
partners are really relieved when the

1116
00:48:52,949 --> 00:48:57,298
subject

1117
00:48:53,338 --> 00:48:59,518
comes up because I think when you know

1118
00:48:57,298 --> 00:49:03,059
your partners in a hospital bed or has

1119
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:05,818
this new injury sex can feel unimportant

1120
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,289
to name very few of the doctors will

1121
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:09,318
bring it up especially if they don't

1122
00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:12,479
perceive that children are an issue and

1123
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:14,608
there's so much there you know like the

1124
00:49:12,478 --> 00:49:16,889
medical industry needs so much training

1125
00:49:14,608 --> 00:49:18,239
about sexuality but they might not even

1126
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:20,518
mention it or they might say something

1127
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,719
flip slip in like wait six weeks and

1128
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:27,899
then you should be able to resume normal

1129
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:29,400
activities like really and I always wish

1130
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,858
like I could pop into people's bedrooms

1131
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,349
as the sex fairy and just be like it's

1132
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:37,558
okay there are options but we don't have

1133
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:39,930
that magical sex fairy and so we need to

1134
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,719
be bold and courageous to just like look

1135
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:45,690
our partner in the eye and be like how

1136
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,639
are we going to connect what are the

1137
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:50,278
stages here what are the seasons ahead

1138
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:53,940
of us right like are we heading towards

1139
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:55,920
a terminal illness and we're facing a

1140
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,869
very specific season ahead of us is or

1141
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,088
is this the acute phase and things are

1142
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,640
gonna get better

1143
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:05,130
most of the time you don't actually know

1144
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:06,808
and so it's just about being and this is

1145
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,269
a language that really came out of my

1146
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:12,660
illness was being in the current sexual

1147
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:14,218
season that you are in looking at your

1148
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:16,440
partner being like this is where we are

1149
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:19,170
right now what do you need what do I

1150
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,739
need how can we meet each other where do

1151
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:25,950
our Venn diagrams overlap they might not

1152
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:27,298
be touching at all and some of this and

1153
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:29,038
I think well maybe touch on this later

1154
00:50:27,298 --> 00:50:31,440
but is what is your partner like what is

1155
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,660
the non ill person need assuming just

1156
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,170
one of you is more deeply impacted

1157
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:38,940
although that's not always true

1158
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:40,349
what is the healthier partner need the

1159
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,880
more able-bodied partner need because

1160
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:43,588
sometimes their needs get totally

1161
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,749
overlooked it becomes all about the sick

1162
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:50,608
person and resentment starts to build

1163
00:50:45,748 --> 00:50:52,798
and they start you know that can lead to

1164
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:56,670
other things and so it's a conversation

1165
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:59,579
about both of you and about recognizing

1166
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:03,588
the season you're in deeply with honesty

1167
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:06,420
with humility with all the fields and

1168
00:51:03,588 --> 00:51:07,199
then starting the conversation about

1169
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,180
okay

1170
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:13,439
like what do we need what do we need to

1171
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:15,358
talk about to move forward and sometimes

1172
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,470
talking itself is the erotic

1173
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,809
relationship for a while

1174
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:20,009
you know if you can't physically move

1175
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:23,639
maybe you're gonna be in a conversation

1176
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:27,119
for a few months and that's an

1177
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:29,009
opportunity to read erotica together to

1178
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,070
listen to podcasts to get more honest

1179
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:33,420
about what you're both wanting but it

1180
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,859
doesn't always go this smoothly right

1181
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:38,670
like I'm painting a picture of what is

1182
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:39,750
possible you know people are gonna find

1183
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,250
themselves in all sorts of different

1184
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:44,639
contexts and all sorts of different

1185
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:48,809
conversations I think what we want to

1186
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:51,629
try to Center is the dignity the idea

1187
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:53,039
that sexuality can be a pleasurable part

1188
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:56,789
of your life no matter what

1189
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,920
it just might look different and embrace

1190
00:51:56,789 --> 00:52:00,539
this idea of change this is where we are

1191
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:04,530
right now we don't know where we'll be

1192
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:06,480
in three or six months so what fun what

1193
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:09,390
pleasure what connection can we share

1194
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,130
right now some people will be in the

1195
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:12,838
mood to like have an orgasm

1196
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:15,300
the second they wake up in a hospital

1197
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:17,460
bed that impulse is there and they are

1198
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,940
ready to like reclaim their sexuality

1199
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,710
for other people it is dormant asleep it

1200
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:27,530
gets buried under a ton of other

1201
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:31,740
survival needs and it wakes up slowly

1202
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:33,780
so it's so much about seeing where

1203
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:37,348
you're at honoring it fully and then

1204
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:39,540
going from there with support yeah you

1205
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:42,420
have set up a couple different scenarios

1206
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:44,489
so that people can you know create this

1207
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,889
vulnerable environment right where

1208
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:49,078
whatever whatever that looks like for

1209
00:52:46,889 --> 00:52:52,650
them with whoever they're choosing to

1210
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:56,519
speak to and that and that's good I like

1211
00:52:52,650 --> 00:53:01,410
you though have this idealized picture

1212
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:03,750
that that once once folks start talking

1213
00:53:01,409 --> 00:53:05,489
and they and they get the ball rolling

1214
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:09,119
that the world the words will come

1215
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:11,129
freely and and the conversation will be

1216
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:15,210
animated and they'll just be all this

1217
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:17,430
wonderful healing but you know I know

1218
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,789
that for a lot of people that is not

1219
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:21,219
going to be the case

1220
00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:24,130
there there their partner might be in a

1221
00:53:21,219 --> 00:53:27,759
place where they are traumatized from

1222
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:31,390
the other person's injury or whatever's

1223
00:53:27,759 --> 00:53:34,239
going on for them the they may not they

1224
00:53:31,389 --> 00:53:35,978
may be they may have their own sexual

1225
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:38,349
hang-ups where they're like I don't want

1226
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:41,649
to talk about this so so why don't you

1227
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:44,709
share some insights on that if if you're

1228
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:47,918
the patient and you are trying to create

1229
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:50,798
this vulnerable and sharing dynamic so

1230
00:53:47,918 --> 00:53:52,358
that you can kind of get off script and

1231
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:55,239
create this new context as you're

1232
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:58,119
describing but the partner is a little

1233
00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:03,639
resistant because they're just not there

1234
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:06,338
with you in their head yet yeah and

1235
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:08,498
again this is a disparity that can come

1236
00:54:06,338 --> 00:54:10,739
up with or without illness the idea that

1237
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:13,629
one person wants to talk about it and

1238
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:16,900
explore and the other is unwilling and

1239
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:18,219
so much of this again is excavating and

1240
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:22,119
meeting the other person where they're

1241
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:25,958
at and recognizing you know I know you

1242
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:27,278
come from a long line of stubborn women

1243
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:29,078
who aren't willing to talk about my

1244
00:54:27,278 --> 00:54:30,548
things it's really important you know

1245
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:33,189
it's like maybe that's not the best

1246
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:35,650
lead-up what are the best questions I

1247
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:38,379
really like is how can I love you right

1248
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,639
now what is one way I can take care of

1249
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,849
you

1250
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:45,548
especially when I was sick and my role

1251
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:47,199
is like the giver and the lover and the

1252
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:49,438
one with the magic hands like all of

1253
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:52,209
that was gone and part of my

1254
00:54:49,438 --> 00:54:55,178
worthlessness that feeling of despair is

1255
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:56,788
I have nothing left to give I'm taking

1256
00:54:55,179 --> 00:55:01,469
so much as a patient

1257
00:54:56,789 --> 00:55:03,969
I'm not producing right I'm not working

1258
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:06,278
giving your partner giving the sick

1259
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:08,528
partner opportunities to show up and

1260
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:11,159
love and do something is a gift to both

1261
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:14,380
of you so if the healthy partner can say

1262
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,939
what I love is to sit and you know [ __ ]

1263
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:19,179
at you all about my day and have you

1264
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:21,098
just listen great or you know are you

1265
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:22,809
available to give me a foot massage you

1266
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:26,709
might be really sick but still available

1267
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:29,528
to touch your lover are you willing to

1268
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:31,748
sit with me and watch porn and just be

1269
00:55:29,528 --> 00:55:32,949
with me while I watch a little porn and

1270
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:36,879
masturbate like

1271
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:39,639
is that in your vocabulary looking at

1272
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,019
what options are there but okay this

1273
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:44,109
cooks about like you're asking about the

1274
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:45,519
people who are I'm talking about

1275
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,470
watching porn together and you're asking

1276
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,059
about talking about sex there's this

1277
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:51,689
huge gap and you know I work with this

1278
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:54,610
gap every day like our audience

1279
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:58,059
represents this huge range of human

1280
00:55:54,610 --> 00:56:01,210
sexual experience from the frozen and

1281
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:03,549
mired in shame and trauma to the point

1282
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:06,639
that you barely want to look at your own

1283
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:08,070
eroticism to like I am ready to explore

1284
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:11,379
the mountaintops of what's possible

1285
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:13,809
we're all somewhere in that process and

1286
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,369
we swing wildly within it we've been in

1287
00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:19,690
our lives I've been at all stages

1288
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:22,119
multiple times when you're sick the

1289
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:26,650
vulnerability and just like that holding

1290
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:29,859
on to life is so precious and can be so

1291
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:31,539
erotic that your pleasures will make

1292
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,250
themselves known to you because when I

1293
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:35,769
say erotic I don't mean like this is

1294
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:38,590
deeply sexual and sexy I mean erotic as

1295
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:40,659
in you are feeling big feelings you are

1296
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:46,150
feeling alive you're feeling that pulse

1297
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:48,489
of vitality at my sickest is when I felt

1298
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:51,910
that thrumming through me of like what

1299
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:54,219
am i alive for what pleasures are still

1300
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:59,469
available to me you might be someone who

1301
00:56:54,219 --> 00:57:01,869
loves flowers go deep into flowers like

1302
00:56:59,469 --> 00:57:04,949
put flowers by your bedside every day

1303
00:57:01,869 --> 00:57:07,599
and marvel at them and let that fuel you

1304
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:09,939
your relationship with sexuality doesn't

1305
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,909
have to be like the far-out sexy sex we

1306
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:17,470
think about it's this whole range of

1307
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:19,000
pleasure joy connection so if you're

1308
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:22,029
starting this conversation with your

1309
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,510
partner and things have changed so much

1310
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:27,610
of the question is like how what are you

1311
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:30,810
scared of might be a really good place

1312
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:33,039
to start what are you worried about

1313
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:35,079
because that will allow the quite the

1314
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,250
vulnerability from both of you I'm

1315
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:39,099
worried I'll never be able to make love

1316
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:40,840
to you the same way I'm worried we won't

1317
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:42,610
be able to have children I'm worried if

1318
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,900
we do have children we won't be able to

1319
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:46,460
parent the way we thought we'd write

1320
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:49,190
like your worries will come bubbling up

1321
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:51,679
that is going to be scary but you're

1322
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,929
both holding them anyway that's the

1323
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:56,149
thing and I like that too because you're

1324
00:57:53,929 --> 00:58:00,469
not you're not initiating the

1325
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:03,858
conversation with let's do new sexual

1326
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:06,049
things you're starting with tell me your

1327
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:09,108
story that you're saying inside to

1328
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:12,769
yourself and I think that that if the

1329
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:14,000
other partner is you know potentially

1330
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:15,108
going to feel awkward with this

1331
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,679
conversation

1332
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:21,230
starting with them saying their truth

1333
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:24,279
telling their story I would say that

1334
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:27,588
that would be one of the easier places

1335
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,540
to start when somebody's feeling super

1336
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:31,039
hesitant because maybe they have been

1337
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:32,929
traumatized by their partner being

1338
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,088
traumatized and maybe they're not too

1339
00:58:32,929 --> 00:58:37,779
comfortable talking about sex at all I

1340
00:58:35,088 --> 00:58:40,820
mean my gosh I have you know I have

1341
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:45,170
dated women who you know the main thing

1342
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:50,269
they wanted was to just be treated not

1343
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:54,710
meanly right and and and to put someone

1344
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:58,639
in a position where where they're being

1345
00:58:54,710 --> 00:59:02,389
asked to share what matters to them even

1346
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:06,588
just emotionally I would say that that

1347
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:11,838
that may be a really softball entree to

1348
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:13,759
get words and emotions flowing yes yeah

1349
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:16,070
and you know that soft flummery place

1350
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,800
where you're both kind of like torn open

1351
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:21,140
a little bit is a good place to be if

1352
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,880
you can get there safely and again I

1353
00:59:21,139 --> 00:59:25,368
want to come back to that how do you

1354
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:29,210
create a context for these conversations

1355
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:32,390
to happen where you both feel regulated

1356
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:34,300
you feel connected you feel like you can

1357
00:59:32,389 --> 00:59:36,889
say things and mess up and be forgiven

1358
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,380
this is what we call the culture of your

1359
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:40,848
relationship and so depending on what

1360
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,530
the culture of your relationship was

1361
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:46,880
kind of you know before and after

1362
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:48,830
whatever this big change was you'll have

1363
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,140
your own strategies one of the best

1364
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:53,088
strategies is getting in the car and

1365
00:59:51,139 --> 00:59:54,469
driving together for that harder

1366
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:56,179
conversation because you're not forced

1367
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:59,139
to look at each other you're not forced

1368
00:59:56,179 --> 01:00:00,289
into that eye contact that can become

1369
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:02,089
confrontational

1370
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:04,340
some people and there is some kind of

1371
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:05,690
magic about road trip talks isn't it I

1372
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,070
don't know what that's about really and

1373
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,559
maybe it is because you're not looking

1374
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:11,720
at each other or that so often part of

1375
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:14,389
the road trip is at night right and so

1376
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:16,969
somehow we seem maybe we feel a little

1377
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:19,369
safer by the dashboard lights alone but

1378
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:21,469
there really is some magic about the

1379
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:24,079
kind of depth that comes when you're in

1380
01:00:21,469 --> 01:00:26,299
the car for hours together yeah and

1381
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,309
solutions then can start coming up once

1382
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,310
you know what the fears are once you

1383
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:32,630
know what the vulnerabilities are

1384
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:34,279
sometimes you'll say the thing allow

1385
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:36,140
that you're so afraid of and your

1386
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,030
partner will be like Oh baby you don't

1387
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:40,699
need to worry about that that's not even

1388
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:44,330
on my mind and that relief is just

1389
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:46,429
palpable or they'll say I've been

1390
01:00:44,329 --> 01:00:48,349
thinking about that I've been waking up

1391
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:50,239
at night with these thoughts so what do

1392
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:52,339
we do and you can look at each other

1393
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,409
knowing okay now we're both in this

1394
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:56,360
together

1395
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:58,369
or they'll say you know I never even

1396
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,230
thought about that this is what I'm

1397
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:01,309
worried about this is what's right in

1398
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:03,769
front of me preventing me from

1399
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:05,750
connecting with you and then you can

1400
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:07,670
address that together right you need to

1401
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:10,699
get on a same page so you can start

1402
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:14,320
writing what is next what is coming for

1403
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:18,769
you the vast number of changes

1404
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:20,780
adaptations pivots you're gonna have to

1405
01:01:18,769 --> 01:01:22,489
make in your life and this is just try

1406
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,680
again you know we're recording this in

1407
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:26,929
2020 in the middle of a global pandemic

1408
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:30,769
and so we're getting a master lesson in

1409
01:01:26,929 --> 01:01:32,539
change and resilience this is what the

1410
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:35,030
human condition is about and we're

1411
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:37,849
actually really good at it and we're

1412
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:39,950
better at it when we do it together with

1413
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:43,579
people we have established love and

1414
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:46,029
connection and affection with and so you

1415
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:48,079
can leverage this right like

1416
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,820
relationships will change sometimes

1417
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,009
illness injury comes relationships will

1418
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:54,769
end right one partner is just not in for

1419
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:56,090
the ride and that has to be valid you

1420
01:01:54,769 --> 01:01:57,530
know there can be huge amounts of

1421
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:00,079
abandonment betrayal and all sorts of

1422
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:02,090
things there but if you are in for the

1423
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,650
ride together if you are saying all

1424
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:06,590
right we're gonna embrace this change

1425
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:08,930
and keep on loving each other this is a

1426
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:11,300
moment where everything gets to change

1427
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:14,629
and both of your needs get to be more

1428
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:18,470
fully met and you get to be in that

1429
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:21,619
crazy wild adventure of living together

1430
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:23,538
right illness can wake you up and create

1431
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:25,789
this urgency if we allow it

1432
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:33,349
it can also be terrifying and put us in

1433
01:02:25,789 --> 01:02:35,660
states of freeze but if we are awake to

1434
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:38,000
our condition if we don't feel alone

1435
01:02:35,659 --> 01:02:39,739
with it if we feel resourced which is

1436
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,199
very hard in this particular country

1437
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:43,848
with our healthcare system and again

1438
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:45,409
like what is your stress right because

1439
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:47,630
we talked about all these things if

1440
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:49,219
you're ill probably the top stressors on

1441
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,289
your list have nothing to do with your

1442
01:02:49,219 --> 01:02:55,068
sex life it's health insurance it's

1443
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:57,259
medications it's your job but all of

1444
01:02:55,068 --> 01:03:00,469
those things create a context where you

1445
01:02:57,259 --> 01:03:02,690
no longer feel the place to play you no

1446
01:03:00,469 --> 01:03:07,368
longer feel the desire or the permission

1447
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:09,230
to let go and enjoy yourself and so we

1448
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:11,630
need to look at the whole life context

1449
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:15,380
what the stressors are how you're gonna

1450
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:16,880
relieve your stress cycles together your

1451
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,829
partner might need permission like you

1452
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,420
go to your yoga class three times a week

1453
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:22,880
I'll call in my other friend for the

1454
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:25,400
assistance I need for bath time right

1455
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,900
like you need care networks also to get

1456
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,690
through this the idea that your partner

1457
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:31,579
is gonna be your caretaker help you with

1458
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:33,980
all the health insurance paperwork maybe

1459
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:36,528
be a co-parent and be your lover that's

1460
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:38,240
a lot to ask yeah who else in your

1461
01:03:36,528 --> 01:03:39,559
community can help who else in your

1462
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,379
community can even provide you with

1463
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:43,759
companionship or conversation to lighten

1464
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:46,789
the load between you so there's more

1465
01:03:43,759 --> 01:03:48,650
space for this connection this play but

1466
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:50,630
it's a lot right like we're this is a

1467
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:53,750
lot and I want to say you and I have

1468
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:55,940
both been in it I'm now about four years

1469
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:59,719
out of my health crisis and now living

1470
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:01,789
with chronic illness and pain and it has

1471
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:04,578
completely transformed how I approach my

1472
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:06,289
work as a sex educator I've always been

1473
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:08,539
aware of the complexity of sex we've

1474
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:13,220
always approached it that way this has

1475
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:17,690
been such a humbling lesson in how

1476
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:20,868
complicated how nuanced it can be but

1477
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:22,940
also how powerful it can be to give

1478
01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:24,619
yourself even when you're sick even if

1479
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,920
you're dying even if you're riddled with

1480
01:04:24,619 --> 01:04:28,430
pain permission to ask the question what

1481
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,369
would make me

1482
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:33,949
feel good right now what would give me a

1483
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:36,069
little bit of pleasure in my day maybe

1484
01:04:33,949 --> 01:04:38,389
how can I give someone else pleasure

1485
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:41,750
because a lot of us giving someone else

1486
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:45,289
pleasure is a joy for us too that makes

1487
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:47,989
us feel worthy of being alive again so

1488
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:51,079
even having a shred of that that is like

1489
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:54,829
bring me flowers from my bedside that is

1490
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:55,579
an act of erotic agency on that day and

1491
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:58,670
it counts

1492
01:04:55,579 --> 01:05:01,579
I like this term that you used the

1493
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:04,940
culture of a relationship and I think

1494
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:08,630
that it's something that is probably not

1495
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:10,880
uncommon that someone gets injured or

1496
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:14,300
gets a bad diagnosis in a relationship

1497
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:17,869
and they're already in a really crappy

1498
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:20,840
cultural relationship and you know the

1499
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:23,179
the the the vulnerability and the

1500
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:27,460
strategies that that we're talking about

1501
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:30,169
today they kind of assume a modicum of

1502
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:32,599
healthy culture in the relationship and

1503
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:37,730
I think that it's probably worth

1504
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:41,539
addressing the idea that that maybe you

1505
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:44,840
have got this you know new pain or

1506
01:05:41,539 --> 01:05:46,670
disease or whatever in your life and you

1507
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,269
actually don't want that other person

1508
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,849
around

1509
01:05:47,269 --> 01:05:54,170
they are the trauma has made you realize

1510
01:05:49,849 --> 01:05:58,339
that they are they're not going to be

1511
01:05:54,170 --> 01:06:00,559
helpful during this time and I was

1512
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:02,269
thinking about the first set when you

1513
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,219
talked about how the primary sexual

1514
01:06:02,269 --> 01:06:06,289
relationship is with ourselves

1515
01:06:04,219 --> 01:06:09,109
certainly self gratification but even

1516
01:06:06,289 --> 01:06:11,300
getting yourself flowers right and I

1517
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:17,420
think that people should remain free to

1518
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:19,850
know that they can make a decision to no

1519
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:22,599
longer be with the partner that they

1520
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:26,690
were before the accident or whatever and

1521
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:29,960
it doesn't mean that they are they're

1522
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:32,990
choosing to fire sex right they are

1523
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:34,610
probably choosing to express it

1524
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:39,379
themselves for a while and they're going

1525
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:41,380
to have to you know develop some skills

1526
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:43,269
to

1527
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:45,519
you know attract find another partner

1528
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:48,820
that they could build a healthier

1529
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:51,480
context of relationship with but there

1530
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:55,330
is certainly enough stress that comes

1531
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:57,039
from a from a trauma like that that will

1532
01:06:55,329 --> 01:07:00,099
just go ahead and take a bad

1533
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:02,289
relationship and just crush it well I

1534
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:05,110
think many of us will be nodding along

1535
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:06,789
when we talk about this moment of you

1536
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:10,450
know you see who your friends are

1537
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:12,099
after you get sick you see kind of what

1538
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:15,339
people can hold and I don't want to

1539
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:18,940
judge people who cannot hold the

1540
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:21,490
intensity or some people will just slip

1541
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,869
away but some people in your life will

1542
01:07:21,489 --> 01:07:24,369
show up for you in ways you never

1543
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:26,679
expected

1544
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:28,750
the sad thing here is we don't have a

1545
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:30,669
culture that teaches us how to love one

1546
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:33,130
another this is something I've been

1547
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:35,170
raging against recently we don't have a

1548
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:36,820
culture that shows us how to show up for

1549
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:39,430
our friends in the hospital how to love

1550
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:45,010
people who are dying most of us get

1551
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:46,719
totally freaked out and ghosts so a lot

1552
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:48,670
will change your Friendship Circle will

1553
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:51,489
change your family network will change

1554
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:54,550
let the people in who are offering help

1555
01:07:51,489 --> 01:07:58,119
and as you said show people the door who

1556
01:07:54,550 --> 01:08:02,920
are making you feel lesser than who are

1557
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:05,109
making you feel like a burden you will

1558
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,820
think all about of yourself you do not

1559
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:09,099
need people in your life telling you

1560
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:15,490
that that is their ableism at work that

1561
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:18,430
is their fear of mortality it's it's an

1562
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:20,550
uncanny thing how little healthy people

1563
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:23,230
like to be reminded of their mortality

1564
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:26,050
and so especially again if you come out

1565
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:28,209
of a community of athletes like some of

1566
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:31,119
your friends are gonna be really shitty

1567
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:33,010
to you some people and often it's the

1568
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:34,420
people who have had a sick mother or a

1569
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:37,329
sick friend who have gone through an

1570
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:40,029
illness themselves will show compassion

1571
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:41,350
for you let it in and allow your life to

1572
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:44,289
change in that way too but yes

1573
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:47,680
absolutely if your relationship is not

1574
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:51,430
one that can change with this change in

1575
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:54,400
your life it takes an act of courage to

1576
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:55,210
be even more you know I don't use the

1577
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,358
word alone

1578
01:08:55,210 --> 01:09:00,659
without partnership without that support

1579
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:03,250
but bad support is actually a burden so

1580
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:04,930
yeah yeah bad support just makes

1581
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:06,810
everything worse right sometimes like oh

1582
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:09,279
my gosh I wish my helper would go away

1583
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:11,200
I'd rather be trying this on my own and

1584
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:14,140
there might be a step there what is your

1585
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:17,289
helper need like you know again we're

1586
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:19,539
not trained to be caretakers and I've

1587
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:21,759
been in both the role of caretaking

1588
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:24,039
someone with a huge major illness and

1589
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,479
being taken care of to the point where

1590
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:28,479
you know I couldn't lift my limbs and

1591
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:31,389
they were being arranged for me the hat

1592
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:32,379
role is like a sacred beautiful role and

1593
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:36,930
if you're not getting professional

1594
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:40,989
support you might as a family in it as

1595
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:43,029
an individual need to ask for more help

1596
01:09:40,988 --> 01:09:45,519
about how to make these changes our

1597
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:47,319
medical system again you get sent home

1598
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:50,650
from the hospital with a brochure and

1599
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:52,600
it's like good luck figuring it out so

1600
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:55,119
for me it's you know online communities

1601
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,340
of people with my condition podcast like

1602
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:59,710
this are where you will get the support

1603
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:01,810
to figure out the changes ahead of you

1604
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:03,579
ask other people with your condition

1605
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:05,590
about their sex life

1606
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:07,180
right get on the Facebook group and be

1607
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:08,739
the bold one to be like so what have you

1608
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:14,100
guys figured out about your sex life

1609
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:16,869
after this any tips you'll get responses

1610
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,250
you have to be willing to talk about

1611
01:10:16,869 --> 01:10:20,469
this and know that you're not alone

1612
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:22,300
whatever you're facing right whether

1613
01:10:20,469 --> 01:10:25,270
that's sex through pain sex through

1614
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,860
disease sex at the end of life there are

1615
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:30,150
people who have done this before and

1616
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:32,289
have your back and can be in loving

1617
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:34,229
conversation with you to figure this

1618
01:10:32,289 --> 01:10:36,729
[ __ ] out you do not have to go it alone

1619
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:38,799
another thing that our American culture

1620
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:42,189
is not super great at at the moment is

1621
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:45,510
self-care and in the first set we hit on

1622
01:10:42,189 --> 01:10:48,009
depression as an obstacle to sexuality

1623
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:50,500
you know any suggestions on getting

1624
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:52,210
yourself in the mood like I it sounds

1625
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,819
like it can be obvi you know it should

1626
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:57,869
be an obvious thing but I think that

1627
01:10:54,819 --> 01:11:01,000
with the with the general lack of

1628
01:10:57,869 --> 01:11:05,019
self-care that we have in our country

1629
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,750
and then if you add pain or a diagnosis

1630
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:09,520
or something that pushes up us off our

1631
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:11,770
game

1632
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:16,650
that it may not be immediately obvious

1633
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:19,420
to people to kind of get themselves back

1634
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:23,799
in their own mindset to even want to be

1635
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:26,010
sexual yeah so this is another one of

1636
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,869
those moments for a swimming upstream

1637
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:31,270
and getting a new framework that will

1638
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:33,849
help here and that is one of the two

1639
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:36,969
forms of desire the two forms of sexual

1640
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:39,190
interest we talked about spontaneous

1641
01:11:36,969 --> 01:11:41,469
desire a lot right I'm just in the mood

1642
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:44,669
I get horny it was like a thunderbolt

1643
01:11:41,469 --> 01:11:47,890
comes out of this guy and bam that is

1644
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:50,469
not often how people get aroused

1645
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:53,170
there's also responsive desire where

1646
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:55,689
something feels good your brain tracks

1647
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:58,350
it it says mmm that feels good more of

1648
01:11:55,689 --> 01:12:00,579
that please and it builds on itself so

1649
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:02,829
when we kind of know that both

1650
01:12:00,579 --> 01:12:06,609
spontaneous desire and responsive desire

1651
01:12:02,829 --> 01:12:09,850
possible responsive desire is the one we

1652
01:12:06,609 --> 01:12:13,059
have a lot more agency over we can start

1653
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:15,340
cultivating an attitude of curiosity

1654
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,929
about pleasure

1655
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:19,060
right so so much of this is a curiosity

1656
01:12:16,929 --> 01:12:20,829
towards pleasure what is bringing me

1657
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:25,840
pleasure today I'm going to follow that

1658
01:12:20,829 --> 01:12:29,079
thread and in the mood for what again if

1659
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:31,300
it's a package deal of kissing oral sex

1660
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:32,948
intercourse and I'm not in the mood for

1661
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:35,590
intercourse I'm just gonna throw out the

1662
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:39,339
whole package maybe I'm in the mood to

1663
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:41,260
cuddle and I can express that like it

1664
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:43,420
would feel really good just to lie in

1665
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:46,150
bed turn all the lights off get under

1666
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:49,690
three duvets and have you lie behind me

1667
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:52,988
naked can you give yourself permission

1668
01:12:49,689 --> 01:12:55,928
to ask for what you want that is a huge

1669
01:12:52,988 --> 01:12:58,059
skill set and the first part of that

1670
01:12:55,929 --> 01:12:58,750
skill set is like tuning into your own

1671
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:01,330
body

1672
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:02,859
this is interception of feeling your

1673
01:13:01,329 --> 01:13:06,340
feelings feeling how your body is

1674
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:08,229
feeling noticing little sparks of desire

1675
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:11,980
like oh it would feel so good to be held

1676
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:14,079
right now and then giving yourself

1677
01:13:11,979 --> 01:13:19,419
permission to move towards that to ask

1678
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:20,738
for it you know the word depression can

1679
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:22,239
mean a lot of things it can mean

1680
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:22,539
clinical depression that needs to be

1681
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:24,849
like

1682
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:28,619
read it as its own thing but for a lot

1683
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:33,579
of us it can also mean context and the

1684
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:35,800
context is so important for arousal and

1685
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:37,479
this brings up another framework and

1686
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,960
again we'll link to deeper podcast so

1687
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:43,479
you can geek out on what interests you

1688
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:45,550
but arousal works kind of like a gas and

1689
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:47,889
brakes model and we are often thinking

1690
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:49,750
about what would put more gas on it what

1691
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:51,310
would give me more interest but it's

1692
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:54,010
really useful to think about what is

1693
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:55,750
putting the brakes on my desire what is

1694
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:58,449
putting the brakes on my interest or my

1695
01:13:55,750 --> 01:14:00,159
willingness and those are some of the

1696
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:03,340
things we can start actively managing

1697
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:05,979
maybe my bedroom has become like filled

1698
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:07,960
with medical equipment and it just

1699
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:10,179
doesn't feel sexy is there anything you

1700
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,430
can do to make your bedroom have more

1701
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:15,640
context and the medical equipment live

1702
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:19,450
in another room or can you do a hotel

1703
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:22,840
room once a month what about your

1704
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:25,269
context can you change are there

1705
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:27,940
medications that are deeply impacting

1706
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:30,760
things can you tweak that are there ways

1707
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:32,469
of like parts of the day like you have a

1708
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,810
lot of energy in the morning at night

1709
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:36,670
your pain is spiking can you have a

1710
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:38,380
conversation about like can we have a

1711
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:40,119
little bit of time in the morning to

1712
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:42,850
just roll around in bed because that's

1713
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:45,930
when my body feels best

1714
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:51,100
we each develop our strategies here

1715
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:52,990
based on our conditions but so much of

1716
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:55,780
this comes back to permission are you

1717
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:58,899
giving yourself permission for pleasure

1718
01:14:55,779 --> 01:15:02,439
and I dare you to even start

1719
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:04,059
prioritizing your pleasure when we're

1720
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:05,769
sick when we're like you know there's

1721
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:07,630
always insurance calls to make there's

1722
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,950
always work to catch up on we always

1723
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:12,310
feel like we're not contributing enough

1724
01:15:08,949 --> 01:15:15,069
to the household do you have the mental

1725
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:16,900
space to say it's okay to take 20

1726
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:19,569
minutes and just do something because it

1727
01:15:16,899 --> 01:15:22,539
feels good for a lot of us like that's

1728
01:15:19,569 --> 01:15:24,099
the first like is there permission for

1729
01:15:22,539 --> 01:15:26,979
pleasure in your life anymore

1730
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:30,070
if not how do you give that to yourself

1731
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:33,699
and then what's important is noticing

1732
01:15:30,069 --> 01:15:36,359
the impact of it because pleasure is

1733
01:15:33,699 --> 01:15:40,599
some of the best medicine we have

1734
01:15:36,359 --> 01:15:43,210
pleasure is what allows us to connect

1735
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:44,740
with others and share deep feelings that

1736
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:47,800
makes us feel like part of the human

1737
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:51,159
family pleasure is what motivates us

1738
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:53,199
into the next day and pleasure can be an

1739
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:55,689
amazing painkiller orgasms can be an

1740
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:58,689
incredible painkiller pleasure can get

1741
01:15:55,689 --> 01:16:01,479
your mind off of your disease for like

1742
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:06,839
15 precious minutes where you are not

1743
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:11,069
your illness and that freedom can

1744
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:14,650
transform your experience of being ill

1745
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:18,789
this is about agency like I am ill but I

1746
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:22,779
am still also a mother a lover a friend

1747
01:16:18,789 --> 01:16:25,510
I am ill but I'm also still loving

1748
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:28,029
massage and a little kinky I am ill but

1749
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:30,100
I also still want orgasms and oral sex

1750
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:33,429
right like you're ill but what else is

1751
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:37,420
true about you let yourself have

1752
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:39,640
permission to be an erotic being on your

1753
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:44,050
own terms right now and see what that

1754
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:47,079
looks like for you knowing it doesn't

1755
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:50,320
have to be the pornstar model at all to

1756
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:52,119
be deeply satisfying and nourishing and

1757
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:55,439
that's another thing I get after a

1758
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:59,260
decade in this field plus what is

1759
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:03,069
satisfying and fulfilling to us as

1760
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:06,130
erotic beings it's so vast and variable

1761
01:17:03,069 --> 01:17:09,189
and changeable but that feeling of like

1762
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:12,489
yes I am here in my sexuality I am a

1763
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:16,719
whole person pleasure is available and

1764
01:17:12,489 --> 01:17:18,880
accessible to me that is available to

1765
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:21,400
all of us in one form or another that

1766
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,770
sense of freedom and erotic wholeness is

1767
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:26,619
what we all long for like how do we get

1768
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:28,150
there now and that's the

1769
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:32,470
choose-your-own-adventure that's the

1770
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:34,269
dance all in so you know in an ideal

1771
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:36,640
world we would end that line of

1772
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:38,140
questioning there because because oh you

1773
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,610
know we're essentially giving the

1774
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:41,829
message you know that there are

1775
01:17:39,609 --> 01:17:44,139
solutions for you you know you guys do

1776
01:17:41,829 --> 01:17:44,920
you think out of the box and and you can

1777
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:47,800
get there

1778
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:48,460
but I think that I want to ask a

1779
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,430
question

1780
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:54,730
to give voice to a certain group of

1781
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:58,390
people who have already tried this and

1782
01:17:54,729 --> 01:18:02,079
they have been unsuccessful in getting

1783
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:04,060
themselves in the mood and their pain is

1784
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:07,059
overarching or their disease is

1785
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:09,520
overarching and they have not been able

1786
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:12,670
to reignite their sexual vibes because

1787
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,170
of it and you know maybe they're there

1788
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:16,750
for their partner for their for their

1789
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:20,260
pleasure or not but for themselves

1790
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:22,420
they've decided they're done with sex

1791
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:24,550
right they've given up on having sex

1792
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:26,949
they've just decided that I'm not even

1793
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:29,949
going to try anymore because I have done

1794
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:32,229
all the trying I can do we have anything

1795
01:18:29,949 --> 01:18:35,109
heartening for those folks who are

1796
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:36,759
afraid that their their relationship

1797
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:41,349
with their sexuality and maybe their

1798
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:44,260
relationship is doomed hmm well there's

1799
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:47,230
two pieces here you can give up and have

1800
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:49,659
that be okay you can have very little

1801
01:18:47,229 --> 01:18:51,218
interest in sexuality in general or

1802
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:54,189
sexual connection with another person

1803
01:18:51,219 --> 01:18:57,640
and some people are asexual their whole

1804
01:18:54,189 --> 01:18:59,289
life and that is not a struggle for them

1805
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:01,360
so it's not a problem if it's not a

1806
01:18:59,289 --> 01:19:04,779
problem for you there's no magic number

1807
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:07,869
of kinds of sex or frequency of sex that

1808
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:10,359
makes a sex life healthy it's healthy if

1809
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:14,019
it feels good and right and fulfilling

1810
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:15,429
to you so what are the areas that don't

1811
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:17,080
feel right what are the areas that still

1812
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:18,880
feel like a struggle you may say like I

1813
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:21,279
am never have I just talked to a woman

1814
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,319
who is like I am never having sex again

1815
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:25,269
and she was like I've given up on

1816
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:29,469
sexuality turn it on she went all into

1817
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:32,110
it but she delights in all of these

1818
01:19:29,469 --> 01:19:33,489
other things with human beings and has

1819
01:19:32,109 --> 01:19:35,259
all this whole other set of pleasures

1820
01:19:33,488 --> 01:19:38,859
that she fills her life with and has

1821
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:40,719
like a really fulfilling life so giving

1822
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:45,759
up on what are you giving up on pleasure

1823
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:47,829
because that sounds um that's to be me

1824
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,719
yeah that's different and I don't even

1825
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:52,479
want to problematize that because I'd

1826
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:55,810
like their depths of human experience

1827
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:59,649
that I cannot understand when I was at

1828
01:19:55,810 --> 01:20:01,150
my most ill you know I had lost a

1829
01:19:59,649 --> 01:20:02,229
hundred pounds I had lost all of my

1830
01:20:01,149 --> 01:20:04,750
muscle mass

1831
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:07,119
and I was like my life was reduced I was

1832
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:10,569
in bed feeling the sheets against my

1833
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:15,970
very frail body and all my body was was

1834
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:17,920
pain right at that moment I also had a

1835
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:19,869
one and a half year old daughter I had

1836
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,569
this beautiful wife I had this purpose

1837
01:20:19,869 --> 01:20:24,699
filled work I loved and so my pleasure

1838
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:27,219
just became about stayin alive

1839
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:30,760
my pleasure became about hoping for

1840
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:32,739
healing became about doing research into

1841
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:36,909
my own healing so I could try at least

1842
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:40,629
to you know keep my feet pleasure had

1843
01:20:36,909 --> 01:20:42,488
totally changed for me and then it

1844
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:48,220
changed again and then it changed again

1845
01:20:42,488 --> 01:20:50,738
and then it changed again and that trust

1846
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,600
in change is what I think I really want

1847
01:20:50,738 --> 01:20:54,009
to bring to this because you might have

1848
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,870
just given up on sex like you might

1849
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:58,360
never imagine you're gonna be erotic

1850
01:20:55,869 --> 01:21:00,579
with anyone that is fine if that is what

1851
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:03,099
is healthy and feels real and right to

1852
01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:04,659
you good you might have other priorities

1853
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:07,060
in front of you you might have you know

1854
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:09,189
a diagnosis and be like I don't want to

1855
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:12,100
spend any time chasing tail I'm gonna

1856
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:16,000
write make that writing as pleasurable

1857
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:16,600
as you can buy the best pen you know

1858
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,738
like

1859
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:22,989
luxuriate and whatever we are doing with

1860
01:21:20,738 --> 01:21:24,819
these lives of ours I think you know

1861
01:21:22,988 --> 01:21:27,099
that's the urgency I talk about when we

1862
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:28,539
realize you know my disease is one I

1863
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,550
have to manage every day and kind of

1864
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:33,130
keep myself alive by pushing buttons and

1865
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:36,220
double-a batteries that action every day

1866
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:39,609
just reminds me of this preciousness and

1867
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:41,470
whatever spiritual overlay you have you

1868
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:43,960
know and I light up a bowl of cannabis

1869
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:48,340
and exhale and look out the window and

1870
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:50,319
feel alive in my human body even if it's

1871
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:52,270
pain I'm feeling I'm kind of like

1872
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:53,130
there's a gratitude of just being here

1873
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:57,489
for it

1874
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:59,710
so I think like give up on what you like

1875
01:21:57,488 --> 01:22:02,319
give it up we have we all have to give

1876
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:04,750
up a lot there's a surrender like give

1877
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:08,049
it up and then be like what's left what

1878
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:10,719
do I want to do as I'm drawing this

1879
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:14,130
breath as I'm exhaling this smoke as I

01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,689
the Mendocino California cannabis

1909
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:25,210
breeder called mandelbrot is one of

1910
01:23:22,689 --> 01:23:27,759
these people Mandelbrot was also known

1911
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:29,470
as roz truth and his cultivars are known

1912
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,409

1913
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:35,110
triangles world-famous gasoline scented

1914
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:37,119
terpene profile back in the day when it

1915
01:23:35,109 --> 01:23:37,989
was really hard to find quality genetics

1916
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:40,359
and education

1917
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:41,920
Mandelbrot was advocating for organic

1918
01:23:40,359 --> 01:23:43,779
growing techniques and providing

1919
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,510
exceptional seeds that would sell out as

1920
01:23:43,779 --> 01:23:48,250
soon as they hit the shelves

1921
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:51,220
Mandelbrot lived too short of life dying

1922
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:53,500
in 2015 but while he was with us he

1923
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:56,530
created several connoisseur level canvas

1924
01:23:53,500 --> 01:24:00,520
masterpieces like oil spill the truth

1925
01:23:56,529 --> 01:24:02,679

1926
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:04,600

1930
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:14,170
grow or to smoke Mandelbrot's creations

1931
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:15,579
excel in every category and that's why

1932
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:19,060

01:25:05,738 --> 01:25:09,879
business owner you are incredibly busy

1955
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:11,590
in reality you are responsible for

1956
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,690
everything your company does you've got

1957
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:15,279
so many responsibilities every single

1958
01:25:13,689 --> 01:25:17,349
day that often you just don't have the

1959
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,658
time to really dig into your marketing

1960
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:20,889
as deeply as you'd like you know there's

1961
01:25:19,658 --> 01:25:22,960
more that you could do to reach out to

1962
01:25:20,889 --> 01:25:24,639
new customers and encourage loyalty and

1963
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,380
the customers you already have but you

1964
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,550
certainly don't have the time for it and

1965
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:30,100
you're not ready to hire somebody

1966
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:32,800
full-time for that role either for you I

1967

excited to make your logo packaging and

1972
01:25:41,139 --> 01:25:45,250

1973

responsibility for improving your bottom

1974
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:49,569
line up to you they don't want that kind

1975
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:51,460
of responsibility but that's pretty much

happen to be a new cannabis company or

1983
01:26:04,658 --> 01:26:08,289
an established company moving from

for moon time medicinals and humbled at

1992
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:29,109
moon time medicinals calm Kirsten and

1993
01:26:27,609 --> 01:26:31,119
her team put together a whole brand

1994
01:26:29,109 --> 01:26:33,250
package for them built their website and

1995
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:34,840
wrote their sales materials no doubt

1996
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:36,460
this is a paid commercial spot but that

1997
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,650
does not mean they bought my opinion

1998
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:40,239
I've worked with blunt branding on five

1999
01:26:38,649 --> 01:26:41,259
projects now for various of their

2000
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:42,879
clients and ever

2001
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:44,500
single time they have done more than

2002
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,869
they have promised and over delivered on

2003
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:48,880
results I love how they generate new

2004
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:50,949
revenue and focus on that as the goal

2005
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,289
instead of just making a pretty logo

2006
01:26:50,949 --> 01:26:55,000
similarly every single friend I have

2007
01:26:53,289 --> 01:26:56,800
referred them to has come back to thank

2008

the right density to have a nice pull

2044

Shango losan our guest this week is sex

2082
01:29:46,659 --> 01:29:52,300
educator Chris Maxwell rose so Chris

2083
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:53,799
we've gotten to the meat of the

2084
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:56,500
situation that's probably what a lot of

2085
01:29:53,800 --> 01:30:00,520
people came for it's like how do I still

2086
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:03,069
have sex when I feel like this so let's

2087
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,570
start off with limited mobility so what

2088
01:30:03,069 --> 01:30:07,389
do you recommend to people with limited

2089
01:30:04,569 --> 01:30:10,689
mobility to figure out the new positions

2090
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:13,630
that will work for them uniquely totally

2091
01:30:10,689 --> 01:30:15,969
it is so much about finding what works

2092
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:18,220
not only for your body but how your body

2093
01:30:15,970 --> 01:30:19,590
fits with the other body for the thing

2094
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:21,520
your bodies want to be doing together

2095
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:23,260
right and so when we think about

2096
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,870
positions it's easy to think about

2097
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:30,220
positions for intercourse but there are

2098
01:30:25,869 --> 01:30:33,430
also positions for cuddling for spanking

2099
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:36,610
for cunnilingus and fellatio for all

2100
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:39,789
sorts of pleasures right and so so much

2101
01:30:36,609 --> 01:30:42,639
of it is finding that geometry the way

2102
01:30:39,789 --> 01:30:44,350
your bodies fit together now because how

2103
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:46,600
you fit together in the past is not

2104
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:49,890
probably how you fit together now how

2105
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:52,600
you can move to do those things right so

2106
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:55,030
again our mind might go to thrusting

2107
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:57,340
what position will be most comfortable

2108
01:30:55,029 --> 01:31:00,189
for my hips to move in a thrusting

2109
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:03,850
motion to have that kind of intercourse

2110
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:05,469
I used to have if that's the question

2111
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:06,669
that's like a very specific set of

2112
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:09,369
parameters

2113
01:31:06,668 --> 01:31:12,099
if the question is what are the

2114
01:31:09,368 --> 01:31:15,639
positions where my partner and I can

2115
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:18,010
have PVI penis vagina intercourse right

2116
01:31:15,639 --> 01:31:20,649
if that's the goal that kind of

2117
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:22,958
connection there's a lot of positions

2118
01:31:20,649 --> 01:31:24,969
you can be in if you're willing to give

2119
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:27,368
up the thrusting so how important is the

2120
01:31:24,969 --> 01:31:28,599
thrusting to you and so a lot of this is

2121
01:31:27,368 --> 01:31:30,219
kind of breaking it down to the

2122
01:31:28,599 --> 01:31:32,439
essentials like what does my body want

2123
01:31:30,219 --> 01:31:35,429
to be doing how do I make that happen

2124
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:39,280
a lot of this is getting out of

2125
01:31:35,429 --> 01:31:41,559
missionary style which I learned by

2126
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:45,458
being you know a woman wearing a

2127
01:31:41,559 --> 01:31:47,949
strap-on how much work it is to be in

2128
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:51,969
missionary style penetrating someone

2129
01:31:47,948 --> 01:31:57,578
it's like an athletic feat especially if

2130
01:31:51,969 --> 01:31:59,948
you want to make it big right and so if

2131
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:02,438
that athletic feat is not available to

2132
01:31:59,948 --> 01:32:04,388
you right now or ever again we're gonna

2133
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:07,449
look at all sorts of other ways of

2134
01:32:04,389 --> 01:32:10,449
creating penetration and movement so

2135
01:32:07,448 --> 01:32:13,328
some of this might be standing up is

2136
01:32:10,448 --> 01:32:15,398
standing up available for you where you

2137
01:32:13,328 --> 01:32:17,380
can position your bed height you know

2138
01:32:15,399 --> 01:32:18,789
their risers for your bed come in all

2139
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:21,189
sorts of different heights if you can

2140
01:32:18,788 --> 01:32:23,408
position your bed so your partner can

2141
01:32:21,189 --> 01:32:25,630
either be lying face-up bent over the

2142
01:32:23,408 --> 01:32:28,808
bed all sorts of positions and that's a

2143
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:31,328
good height for your hips to move for

2144
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:33,760
some people standing and moving is much

2145
01:32:31,328 --> 01:32:35,918
easier than being up on elbows or their

2146
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,458
hands holding their weight and then

2147
01:32:35,918 --> 01:32:42,099
moving so that might be an option

2148
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:45,578
there's all sorts of props and pillows

2149
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:47,860
and tools that you can bring into your

2150
01:32:45,578 --> 01:32:50,049
bedroom again if you get over the

2151
01:32:47,859 --> 01:32:53,348
attitude that these things are kinky or

2152
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:56,159
weird or you know just for women or toys

2153
01:32:53,349 --> 01:33:00,639
or for all of us tools are for all of us

2154
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:02,348
and there's so many different kinds of

2155
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:05,199
toys and tools that can assist you in

2156
01:33:02,349 --> 01:33:07,630
creating the kinds of experiences you

2157
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:10,779
want to be creating so I'm thinking

2158
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:12,429
about something like a sex sling for

2159
01:33:10,779 --> 01:33:14,438
some people they might think whoa that's

2160
01:33:12,429 --> 01:33:16,059
like a sex swing that's so kinky they

2161
01:33:14,439 --> 01:33:17,918
think of all the sitcoms where you know

2162
01:33:16,059 --> 01:33:19,779
the closet door has swung open to reveal

2163
01:33:17,918 --> 01:33:20,529
the little like dungeon inside with a

2164
01:33:19,779 --> 01:33:23,420
swing

2165
01:33:20,529 --> 01:33:27,170
yes they are found in sex clubs they are

2166
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:29,779
also an assisted mobility device if you

2167
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:32,210
think of it that way and having a

2168
01:33:29,779 --> 01:33:35,059
portable swing you can take out that you

2169
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:36,980
can put your partner in and that allows

2170
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:39,800
you to connect it doesn't have to be

2171
01:33:36,979 --> 01:33:41,449
kinky at all right wrap some silks

2172
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:43,850
around it and make it like you're a

2173
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:45,409
little love sure I and like put your own

2174
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:49,010
aesthetics on these things and they can

2175
01:33:45,409 --> 01:33:51,738
become yours if you claim them right

2176
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:53,719
like what is stopping you from getting a

2177
01:33:51,738 --> 01:33:56,509
sex pillow is it the idea of having sex

2178
01:33:53,719 --> 01:33:58,819
furniture well now they come in all

2179
01:33:56,510 --> 01:34:01,520
sorts of aesthetics so your sex pillow

2180
01:33:58,819 --> 01:34:03,920
can also be your reading pillow and if

2181
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,570
your cousin comes over it's like you

2182
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,619
know that's my wedge I use for reading

2183
01:34:05,569 --> 01:34:08,719
it's really great you should check it

2184
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:10,219
out right like we don't have to and then

2185
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:15,109
they're all like let me show you how to

2186
01:34:10,219 --> 01:34:17,510
use that wedge you use for reading it's

2187
01:34:15,109 --> 01:34:19,670
like the shame of bringing these things

2188
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:22,100
in can prevent them from being really

2189
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:24,819
powerful tools and devices for us and so

2190
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:29,030
I want to give you permission to explore

2191
01:34:24,819 --> 01:34:32,539
toys and tools assistive devices of all

2192
01:34:29,029 --> 01:34:34,479
kinds right so you asked about assisted

2193
01:34:32,539 --> 01:34:38,750
mobility that can mean a lot of things

2194
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:40,339
all the way up to being paraplegic or

2195
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:45,500
hemiplegic or semi plee Jake in a

2196
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:49,969
wheelchair where you're sex like it

2197
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:51,800
might have to be totally reinvent so

2198
01:34:49,969 --> 01:34:54,140
again it's assessing what's true for you

2199
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,960
now asking for help there are some great

2200
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:59,719
resources there's a sex educator named L

2201
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:02,420
chase and she wrote a book about sex

2202
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:05,300
positions specifically for fat people

2203
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:07,340
and people of size but what that enabled

2204
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:10,460
her to really look at is how do sex

2205
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:12,020
positions get adopted how do we move out

2206
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:15,140
of bed onto different pieces of

2207
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:16,880
furniture to allow all of our different

2208
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:21,170
bodies of all different sizes and

2209
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:23,329
abilities to fit together so bed is not

2210
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:26,960
necessarily the best place for sex for a

2211
01:35:23,329 --> 01:35:29,750
lot of us if you can sit in a chair or

2212
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:33,439
on a stool and your partner is able to

2213
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:35,930
straddle you and ride you

2214
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:38,359
that might be your new favorite position

2215
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:40,699
because your body gets to relax your

2216
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:43,698
lower lumbar that needs support has your

2217
01:35:40,698 --> 01:35:45,979
extra pillow you feel supported and now

2218
01:35:43,698 --> 01:35:47,988
you get you know your queen on top of

2219
01:35:45,979 --> 01:35:53,329
you riding you but again that requires

2220
01:35:47,988 --> 01:35:54,948
her to feel comfortable doing that you

2221
01:35:53,329 --> 01:35:56,750
know and we can take and there's all

2222
01:35:54,948 --> 01:35:58,309
sorts of assistive devices like if your

2223
01:35:56,750 --> 01:36:02,770
penis isn't getting as hard as you want

2224
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:05,000
it to be there are toys for that if

2225
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:07,850
penetration is harder than it used to be

2226
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,579
there are loops for that there are some

2227
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:14,180
great cannabis loops that are incredible

2228
01:36:10,579 --> 01:36:18,579
tools for pelvic pain and endometriosis

2229
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:21,590
or recovering pain after pelvic surgery

2230
01:36:18,579 --> 01:36:26,630
cannabis is a really great sexual tool

2231
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:30,230
to manage pelvic pain that would be a

2232
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:32,300
great whole episode yeah so I think it's

2233
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:35,238
so much again about what is possible for

2234
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:37,969
you so if the rusting in bed is not is

2235
01:36:35,238 --> 01:36:40,729
sitting if that's not is standing if

2236
01:36:37,969 --> 01:36:44,899
that's not like what is is lying flat on

2237
01:36:40,729 --> 01:36:47,059
your back and right so what positions

2238
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:49,698
are you able to do and then how do you

2239
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:51,260
adapt that and a book like el Chase's

2240
01:36:49,698 --> 01:36:53,299
will give you all of these pictures so

2241
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:55,159
you have possibilities you and they're

2242
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:57,350
more useful than like those Kama Sutra

2243
01:36:55,159 --> 01:36:59,448
charts that any college dorm rooms yeah

2244
01:36:57,350 --> 01:37:01,280
those are all like a hundred one

2245
01:36:59,448 --> 01:37:03,319
positions for the athletes and the

2246
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:05,389
Cirque de Soleil people what are the

2247
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:07,639
positions for real bodies with real

2248
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:11,930
limitations I think it's important to

2249
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:13,780
point out too that you know certainly

2250
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:17,150
it's it's actually kind of difficult to

2251
01:37:13,779 --> 01:37:18,948
de rata size like toys and dildos and

2252
01:37:17,149 --> 01:37:21,589
things like that but a lot of the the

2253
01:37:18,948 --> 01:37:23,059
supports and pillows and wedges and some

2254
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:27,610
of the other things that we've talked

2255
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:30,260
about they don't have to seem medicinal

2256
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:31,609
in in and I want to go two ways with

2257
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:35,239
that number one I liked what you said

2258
01:37:31,609 --> 01:37:36,559
earlier about claiming a device and you

2259
01:37:35,238 --> 01:37:38,750
know there's a lot of similarities

2260
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,539
between a sex swing and some of those

2261
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:43,369
types of traction I've seen for injured

2262
01:37:41,539 --> 01:37:45,710
people to get in and out of bed like you

2263
01:37:43,369 --> 01:37:48,140
know I can see some dual use there

2264
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:50,090
and if you recontextualize it mmm

2265
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:54,050
suddenly like the there are there are

2266
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:56,920
new options but also there are a lot of

2267
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:59,659
reasons why some of these you know

2268
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:03,350
wedges and pillows were developed to

2269
01:37:59,659 --> 01:38:07,369
begin with it doesn't have to be a oh we

2270
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:10,910
can't have sex the scripted way so we

2271
01:38:07,369 --> 01:38:13,340
have to have this second slightly lesser

2272
01:38:10,909 --> 01:38:14,359
than sex using these pillows so that we

2273
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:17,360
can manage

2274
01:38:14,359 --> 01:38:19,369
in my experience experimenting with some

2275
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:21,949
of that stuff I'm like oh this is

2276
01:38:19,369 --> 01:38:24,079
everything I liked about the scripted

2277
01:38:21,949 --> 01:38:27,019
kinds of sex but now everything is all

2278
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:31,760
way more convenient and nicer this can

2279
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:34,330
actually be an upgrade versus a oh I'm

2280
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:38,150
I'm sent back to the Junior League

2281
01:38:34,329 --> 01:38:40,250
totally totally and you know a goal here

2282
01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:42,559
can be making your sex life even better

2283
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:44,649
than before because you are more awake

2284
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,450
to it you're choosing it more actively

2285
01:38:44,649 --> 01:38:50,389
and the pleasure that is available to

2286
01:38:47,449 --> 01:38:53,630
you is not in any proportion to how

2287
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:55,850
young or able your body is I really want

2288
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:58,279
people to hear that like what is

2289
01:38:55,850 --> 01:39:02,300
accessible to you is so much about your

2290
01:38:58,279 --> 01:39:06,819
attitudes what you bring to it and your

2291
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:11,659
internal sense of freedom you know the

2292
01:39:06,819 --> 01:39:14,420
degree to which we are all mired under

2293
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:17,988
the shame of our sex culture really

2294
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:20,060
cannot be emphasized enough and it takes

2295
01:39:17,988 --> 01:39:24,169
a certain momentum to break through that

2296
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:25,430
and then see the it's like the storm

2297
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:27,170
clouds open and there's this whole

2298
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:28,400
possibility on the other side and

2299
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:32,469
there's this whole community where

2300
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:37,579
errata sysm is celebrated and safe and

2301
01:39:32,469 --> 01:39:39,800
revered and just more as possible for

2302
01:39:37,579 --> 01:39:41,449
you and yeah you might actually find new

2303
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,670
things that you like along the way

2304
01:39:41,449 --> 01:39:46,488
because if you're if you're being pushed

2305
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:49,279
off script that means that you are now

2306
01:39:46,488 --> 01:39:51,889
exploring and when you explore you often

2307
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:56,090
find unexpected things and you know

2308
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:58,680
listening to you know the show that we

2309
01:39:56,090 --> 01:40:02,440
are we have produced

2310
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:04,720
you know my kinks are you know emotional

2311
01:40:02,439 --> 01:40:07,809
vulnerability telling each other your

2312
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:10,990
secrets and win-win right for me that is

2313
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:13,930
super sexualized and this whole entire

2314
01:40:10,989 --> 01:40:16,179
show these these instructions for for

2315
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:18,579
two people coming together and sharing

2316
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:19,840
their hopes and their fears and there

2317
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:23,619
are things they haven't told anybody

2318
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:25,090
else that's hot for me right and so I

2319
01:40:23,619 --> 01:40:28,689
want to suggest to other people that

2320
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:31,449
that even though that sharing may seem

2321
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:33,879
like some emotional work and might seem

2322
01:40:31,449 --> 01:40:35,170
a little awkward or might seem scary to

2323
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:37,569
you before you do it

2324
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:40,390
you may actually feel like it's so

2325
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:42,729
liberating that you can actually have a

2326
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:45,160
more fulfilling sex than you've ever had

2327
01:40:42,729 --> 01:40:46,449
in your life just don't think of it you

2328
01:40:45,159 --> 01:40:50,109
don't have to think of all this as

2329
01:40:46,449 --> 01:40:51,849
medical no yeah I mean your medical

2330
01:40:50,109 --> 01:40:55,599
stuff will have to be managed and then

2331
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:59,079
the rest of it is play toys curious

2332
01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:00,789
exploration the word curiosity comes up

2333
01:40:59,079 --> 01:41:05,350
a lot with us because some of us can

2334
01:41:00,789 --> 01:41:07,510
feel really charged and the spirit of

2335
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:10,030
curiosity allows us to just take baby

2336
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:13,810
steps in and ask what if well what

2337
01:41:10,029 --> 01:41:16,929
happen is what would happen if I you

2338
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:19,420
know tuck my colostomy bag to the side

2339
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:23,710
put a nice pillow over it and then let

2340
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:25,480
myself experience oral sex right you

2341
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:27,250
might find that like that experience of

2342
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:29,019
oral sex is totally available to you

2343
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:30,340
your partner's completely used to your

2344
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:32,800
class me bag by now

2345
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:35,260
doesn't even notice it and it's a game

2346
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,579
changer and we can weep with that relief

2347
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:38,619
sometimes sometimes we have a

2348
01:41:36,579 --> 01:41:40,420
breakthrough moment or a moment where we

2349
01:41:38,619 --> 01:41:44,470
do something we're ashamed of and we do

2350
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:47,289
it anyway and we realize what we've been

2351
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:49,420
holding back and you can weep with

2352
01:41:47,289 --> 01:41:51,300
relief and gratitude at what we have

2353
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:54,250
given ourselves permission to explore

2354
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:57,220
and the baby steps are so important here

2355
01:41:54,250 --> 01:42:02,409
right especially if you've already been

2356
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:04,300
you know tenderized by illness and all

2357
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:06,279
the other kind of survival issues that

2358
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:08,770
come with us again that zone of safety

2359
01:42:06,279 --> 01:42:11,139
where can you establish that zone of

2360
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:12,610
connection where you feel like relaxed

2361
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,710
ready to explore

2362
01:42:12,609 --> 01:42:18,250
with curiosity and just ease into it

2363
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:21,908
maybe that is just reading erotica in

2364
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:23,859
the bathtub or listening to audio

2365
01:42:21,908 --> 01:42:26,948
erotica like while you're getting your

2366
01:42:23,859 --> 01:42:29,529
chemo or listening to audio erotica as

2367
01:42:26,948 --> 01:42:31,029
you're doing your deep breast every

2368
01:42:29,529 --> 01:42:34,509
afternoon that you need to get through

2369
01:42:31,029 --> 01:42:36,069
the day something as simple as that is

2370
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:38,230
just like listening to a naughty story

2371
01:42:36,069 --> 01:42:41,618
on your headphones and allowing yourself

2372
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:43,359
to be lulled into sleep by it you might

2373
01:42:41,618 --> 01:42:44,979
have sweeter dreams and you wake up the

2374
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,139
next day like feeling a little nourished

2375
01:42:44,979 --> 01:42:49,178
by it we do these things because they're

2376
01:42:47,139 --> 01:42:51,520
good for us right we don't seek out

2377
01:42:49,179 --> 01:42:55,510
sexual pleasures and buy all these toys

2378
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:57,100
and trick out our bedrooms because we're

2379
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:59,170
trying to recreate Vegas or something

2380
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:02,320
you know this is not like this is

2381
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:04,630
because it is good and nourishing and

2382
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:06,789
feed some part of our humanity that

2383
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:09,460
wants to be fed we do these things

2384
01:43:06,789 --> 01:43:12,279
because they're healthy right relaxation

2385
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:14,279
is healthy for us orgasms are healthy

2386
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:17,920
they are good for our bodies

2387
01:43:14,279 --> 01:43:19,868
so how do you make space for them how do

2388
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:22,090
you give it permission and how do you

2389
01:43:19,868 --> 01:43:24,250
give it permission to look totally new

2390
01:43:22,090 --> 01:43:26,230
and different and changed and be kind of

2391
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:29,469
excited I mean novelty is something we

2392
01:43:26,229 --> 01:43:30,939
all seek right all of the relationship

2393
01:43:29,469 --> 01:43:32,408
therapists will say oh you're in a

2394
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:34,618
long-term relationship seek novelty

2395
01:43:32,408 --> 01:43:37,329
create change do something different

2396
01:43:34,618 --> 01:43:40,179
life sometimes gives us more novelty

2397
01:43:37,329 --> 01:43:42,488
than we ever wanted to handle and all of

2398
01:43:40,179 --> 01:43:44,170
that change comes as at once but we can

2399
01:43:42,488 --> 01:43:46,238
face it and just be like all right

2400
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:49,929
what's next

2401
01:43:46,238 --> 01:43:51,849
buying your first vibrator is a huge

2402
01:43:49,929 --> 01:43:54,010
experience for people but once you have

2403
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:55,239
one you tend to have four or five and

2404
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:56,949
then you realize like these are just

2405
01:43:55,238 --> 01:43:59,289
tools that allow you to stimulate your

2406
01:43:56,948 --> 01:44:02,649
body like and maybe some of your sex

2407
01:43:59,289 --> 01:44:04,600
stories are like massage boys things

2408
01:44:02,649 --> 01:44:06,908
that help you manage your pain and you

2409
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:08,920
like we have so many body toys around

2410
01:44:06,908 --> 01:44:11,170
this house it's hilarious like we have

2411
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:15,460
all sorts of massage balls and back

2412
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:18,810
things and things that help us with our

2413
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:21,340
bodies manage our symptoms our allies

2414
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:23,110
and even the word medicinal right like

2415
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:26,498
my marijuana is medicinal but it's also

2416
01:44:23,109 --> 01:44:29,768
deeply pleasurable it's a sacrament

2417
01:44:26,498 --> 01:44:32,828
it's a way I socialize with friends and

2418
01:44:29,769 --> 01:44:35,469
it's good medicine just like a really

2419
01:44:32,828 --> 01:44:37,808
rich conversation is good medicine right

2420
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:40,899
I think it's also worthwhile since we're

2421
01:44:37,809 --> 01:44:43,960
all stoners here that you know to time

2422
01:44:40,899 --> 01:44:45,848
your cannabis consumption right so so I

2423
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:49,149
think that you know if you're gonna you

2424
01:44:45,849 --> 01:44:51,819
you know have cannabis be part of your

2425
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:54,609
of your sex play you know think about it

2426
01:44:51,819 --> 01:44:57,908
ahead of time so that you're you're not

2427
01:44:54,609 --> 01:45:00,219
overly checked out or or that you're

2428
01:44:57,908 --> 01:45:03,549
you've had enough so that your pain is

2429
01:45:00,219 --> 01:45:05,198
treated properly at the right time and I

2430
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:08,710
also think that it's important to

2431
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:11,768
remember that you know we become less

2432
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:14,260
inhibited when we use cannabis and that

2433
01:45:11,769 --> 01:45:18,219
and that is good and can be good but

2434
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:22,090
also if that inhibition goes a little

2435
01:45:18,219 --> 01:45:24,880
further than maybe we want we can

2436
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:26,739
actually reenter ourselves right we've

2437
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,319
all I think gotten into the swing of

2438
01:45:26,738 --> 01:45:32,228
things and and and found ourselves

2439
01:45:29,319 --> 01:45:35,768
holding up our bodies in ways that are

2440
01:45:32,229 --> 01:45:38,739
not not good for the injury or just for

2441
01:45:35,769 --> 01:45:42,039
the body in general and but we're like

2442
01:45:38,738 --> 01:45:43,839
we're in the zone you know and and we're

2443
01:45:42,038 --> 01:45:48,939
not gonna we're not going to change it

2444
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:54,340
in that moment and you know using enough

2445
01:45:48,939 --> 01:45:57,158
cannabis where we move through the where

2446
01:45:54,340 --> 01:46:00,099
we go too far we're going the wrong

2447
01:45:57,158 --> 01:46:02,018
direction right so so just be mindful of

2448
01:46:00,099 --> 01:46:05,800
your cannabis use so that you're using

2449
01:46:02,019 --> 01:46:07,030
the right amount in the right modality

2450
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,579
whether it's you know smoking your

2451
01:46:07,029 --> 01:46:12,788
tinctures or whatever and and get

2452
01:46:09,578 --> 01:46:14,618
yourself timed right and you know

2453
01:46:12,788 --> 01:46:18,038
especially if you're feeling awkward

2454
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:20,408
about this don't take more of it so you

2455
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:21,819
feel better but you take more of it and

2456
01:46:20,408 --> 01:46:24,998
then you start having a good time and

2457
01:46:21,819 --> 01:46:26,738
then you go too far mmm wise words yeah

2458
01:46:24,998 --> 01:46:29,198
and dial it in with your strains with

2459
01:46:26,738 --> 01:46:32,319
your terpenes again it's just another

2460
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:35,288
tool that you can use to be with your

2461
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:37,058
body then I want to say two things

2462
01:46:35,288 --> 01:46:39,518
really quick one is adjusting for

2463
01:46:37,059 --> 01:46:40,360
comfort when we get in the zone when we

2464
01:46:39,519 --> 01:46:42,880
feel like Oh

2465
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:45,339
is going good finally at last right

2466
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:49,389
we've made something happen you don't

2467
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:51,460
want to override discomfort or emotional

2468
01:46:49,389 --> 01:46:54,219
or physical discomfort in order to keep

2469
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:57,399
that going there are no martyrs in

2470
01:46:54,219 --> 01:46:58,689
pleasure so keep it pleasurable and if

2471
01:46:57,399 --> 01:47:00,309
you need to make adjustments make

2472
01:46:58,689 --> 01:47:01,809
adjustments and know that what you're

2473
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:04,659
building is doesn't have to be fragile

2474
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:06,250
and again that's the culture of pleasure

2475
01:47:04,658 --> 01:47:08,559
you create in your relationship where

2476
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:11,350
you both have permission to change and

2477
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,940
adjust and make requests and say oh my

2478
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:14,440
feet are cold grab a blanket or oh my

2479
01:47:12,939 --> 01:47:16,419
god I have to get off my ankles over my

2480
01:47:14,439 --> 01:47:19,448
hip just gave out and that's not like oh

2481
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:21,190
you poor weak pathetic thing it's oh my

2482
01:47:19,448 --> 01:47:23,349
gosh but let's find a position that

2483
01:47:21,189 --> 01:47:25,710
works now we want to keep this

2484
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:28,090
pleasurable thing going so let's make it

2485
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:30,550
more pleasurable what could make this

2486
01:47:28,090 --> 01:47:32,829
even better is one of my favorite

2487
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:35,079
questions to ask all the time is what

2488
01:47:32,829 --> 01:47:36,939
could make this even better because it

2489
01:47:35,079 --> 01:47:40,118
acknowledges we have a good beautiful

2490
01:47:36,939 --> 01:47:42,689
mutual pleasurable thing going what's

2491
01:47:40,118 --> 01:47:45,908
next what could make this even better

2492
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:48,250
let's optimize our time together right

2493
01:47:45,908 --> 01:47:52,029
like sex and play and touch these are

2494
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:53,770
all beautiful times we get to share how

2495
01:47:52,029 --> 01:47:55,329
do we take the performance out of it how

2496
01:47:53,770 --> 01:47:59,130
do we take the pressure out of it and

2497
01:47:55,329 --> 01:48:02,050
restore it to play and connection and

2498
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:04,000
that can be hard with medical devices

2499
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:06,789
flying around you know I wear an insulin

2500
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:10,300
pump so I have this like device dangling

2501
01:48:06,789 --> 01:48:13,329
from my body 24/7 an alarm will go off

2502
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:15,400
in the middle of sex it's gotten ripped

2503
01:48:13,329 --> 01:48:19,510
out and blood started spurting on the

2504
01:48:15,399 --> 01:48:23,439
sheets right yeah how do we just move

2505
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:26,560
with these moments or manage them as

2506
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:28,809
best as we can and also just have like

2507
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:31,929
the flexibility right it's like most

2508
01:48:28,810 --> 01:48:34,090
diseases are not static your symptoms

2509
01:48:31,929 --> 01:48:35,529
change day to day so you have to be able

2510
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:39,219
to have that conversation like what are

2511
01:48:35,529 --> 01:48:41,649
you up for now and again knowing a

2512
01:48:39,219 --> 01:48:44,679
five-minute foot massage can lead to a

2513
01:48:41,649 --> 01:48:46,658
blissful hour of sex if things get

2514
01:48:44,679 --> 01:48:49,029
flowing and you're both feeling good and

2515
01:48:46,658 --> 01:48:51,579
you lead like one pleasure to the next

2516
01:48:49,029 --> 01:48:53,948
or if it's just five minutes of foot

2517
01:48:51,579 --> 01:48:54,279
massage and after that five minutes you

2518
01:48:53,948 --> 01:48:55,839
tell

2519
01:48:54,279 --> 01:48:57,340
off your hands and you smile at each

2520
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:59,610
other and you just feel a little bit

2521
01:48:57,340 --> 01:49:03,039
more connected and relaxed that is a win

2522
01:48:59,609 --> 01:49:03,670
that is a like a good thing that just

2523
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:05,680
happened

2524
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:08,260
and you can build on that right I talked

2525
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:10,539
a lot about micro pleasures so for

2526
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:12,340
yourself and then how do you share micro

2527
01:49:10,539 --> 01:49:16,810
pleasures and build on them throughout

2528
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:21,610
the day on a recent episode also about

2529
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:24,700
pain and moving from opioids to cannabis

2530
01:49:21,609 --> 01:49:27,489
we we talked about not comparing your

2531
01:49:24,699 --> 01:49:30,609
experience to others because you know in

2532
01:49:27,489 --> 01:49:33,369
cannabis your dosage may be that you

2533
01:49:30,609 --> 01:49:36,159
need only 2 point 5 milligrams of whole

2534
01:49:33,369 --> 01:49:39,909
plant THC whereas somebody else may be

2535
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:41,199
looking at 25 or 50 milligrams and you

2536
01:49:39,909 --> 01:49:43,149
know in the cannabis scene there's a

2537
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:45,309
there's a little bit of ego coolness

2538
01:49:43,149 --> 01:49:47,379
factor about all that's all you take and

2539
01:49:45,310 --> 01:49:49,570
like I think that's so absurd you know

2540
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:51,970
you know individualized medicine is a

2541
01:49:49,569 --> 01:49:54,279
modern thing and calls for everybody to

2542
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:56,170
take the amount of cannabis that gets

2543
01:49:54,279 --> 01:49:57,789
them the relief that they're looking for

2544
01:49:56,170 --> 01:50:01,659
and it doesn't matter what your neighbor

2545
01:49:57,789 --> 01:50:04,930
is taking so similarly what I would love

2546
01:50:01,659 --> 01:50:07,149
you to speak to is the idea that you

2547
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:08,650
know the various sex toys you've been

2548
01:50:07,149 --> 01:50:11,259
talking about and that are available are

2549
01:50:08,649 --> 01:50:15,039
somehow gender related right like these

2550
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:16,329
are boys toys these are girls toys and

2551
01:50:15,039 --> 01:50:18,279
I've heard you talk about this before

2552
01:50:16,329 --> 01:50:20,859
but I'd like to you to talk you know

2553
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:24,539
address that idea of the universality of

2554
01:50:20,859 --> 01:50:27,609
these and use what the hell you want

2555
01:50:24,539 --> 01:50:29,979
totally more and more of the industry is

2556
01:50:27,609 --> 01:50:33,699
just releasing incredible toys that are

2557
01:50:29,979 --> 01:50:35,289
high tech vibrators and high-quality

2558
01:50:33,699 --> 01:50:37,929
materials that can be used to stimulate

2559
01:50:35,289 --> 01:50:40,479
all sorts of body parts we need to

2560
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:44,920
really get over this idea that vibrators

2561
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:48,189
are for the girls vibrators can be

2562
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:50,199
incredible tools for higher stimulation

2563
01:50:48,189 --> 01:50:53,559
right if your erectile function has

2564
01:50:50,199 --> 01:50:55,389
changed a lot goes into an erection that

2565
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:58,380
could be blood flow that could be nerve

2566
01:50:55,390 --> 01:51:00,220
endings that could be mental stuff

2567
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:03,670
sometimes it's just you want more

2568
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:06,100
stimulation and there's also this whole

2569
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:07,960
category of toys that are just sensation

2570
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:11,260
toys and we tend to think of them

2571
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:13,239
as kinky toys or leather toys or BDSM

2572
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:18,489
toys oh those aren't for me because I'm

2573
01:51:13,238 --> 01:51:22,479
not kinky there's a huge range of toys

2574
01:51:18,488 --> 01:51:24,369
and props in that world that can be used

2575
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:27,189
for just a lightful stimulation and

2576
01:51:24,369 --> 01:51:29,289
sensation and I also just want to

2577
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:33,609
mention a lot of people who experience

2578
01:51:29,289 --> 01:51:38,229
chronic pain find a lot of relief in

2579
01:51:33,609 --> 01:51:39,699
BDSM in heavier sensations and there's a

2580
01:51:38,229 --> 01:51:41,799
lot of really good studies going on

2581
01:51:39,699 --> 01:51:45,849
right now about how that works like how

2582
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:50,289
can we use intentional stimulation to

2583
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:52,450
override pain signals and so again give

2584
01:51:50,289 --> 01:51:54,569
yourself permission right like if some

2585
01:51:52,449 --> 01:51:57,250
part of you is intrigued by a spanking

2586
01:51:54,569 --> 01:52:00,250
read a story about it see how your body

2587
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:02,380
responds spank yourself a little bit

2588
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:04,630
during masturbation see how that impact

2589
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:06,640
play affects your arousal see if it

2590
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:07,930
helps your pain see where it takes your

2591
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:12,219
mind right a lot of this is

2592
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:14,320
experimentation and willingness without

2593
01:52:12,219 --> 01:52:15,819
the judgment right so going back to

2594
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:18,130
mindfulness which is paying attention

2595
01:52:15,819 --> 01:52:20,229
without judgment we have so much

2596
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:22,539
judgment about shame that limits we have

2597
01:52:20,229 --> 01:52:25,059
so much judgment about sexuality that

2598
01:52:22,539 --> 01:52:26,649
limits our experience and some of that

2599
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:28,810
can be like oh that's not for me because

2600
01:52:26,649 --> 01:52:30,519
I'm a man that's not for me because I'm

2601
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:33,880
not kinky that's not for me because I'm

2602
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:36,969
not queer if I did that what would it

2603
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:39,400
mean about my identity and I just want a

2604
01:52:36,969 --> 01:52:42,189
presence very briefly here prostate play

2605
01:52:39,399 --> 01:52:44,500
and anal play for men a lot of men

2606
01:52:42,189 --> 01:52:46,889
explore it under duress when their penis

2607
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:48,909
is no longer working and then discover

2608
01:52:46,890 --> 01:52:50,770
orgasms that are more powerful than

2609
01:52:48,909 --> 01:52:52,840
they've ever had in their life discover

2610
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:54,460
this whole new way of being sexual and

2611
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:59,110
wonder what what the hell is I ever

2612
01:52:54,460 --> 01:53:02,199
waiting for our bodies are capable of so

2613
01:52:59,109 --> 01:53:05,250
much more than we can imagine if we

2614
01:53:02,199 --> 01:53:08,769
explore them with curiosity and joy and

2615
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:11,560
without the shame and misinformation

2616
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:13,540
that limits our experience of it do you

2617
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:15,100
even know your own genitals right like

2618
01:53:13,539 --> 01:53:19,960
we've had this whole conversation about

2619
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:21,640
sex most of us aren't even in a aware

2620
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:24,699
relationship with

2621
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:27,310
our erotic Anatomy with our parts how

2622
01:53:24,699 --> 01:53:31,689
they function how they fit together we

2623
01:53:27,310 --> 01:53:34,020
haven't looked at them very well so some

2624
01:53:31,689 --> 01:53:37,359
of this is just like know thyself and

2625
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:38,710
know where sexuality can fit in the rest

2626
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:41,920
of your life and then give yourself

2627
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:45,640
permission to explore it little bits at

2628
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:47,890
a time with curiosity and get support

2629
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:50,350
right don't do this alone listen to

2630
01:53:47,890 --> 01:53:52,990
podcasts read books talk to your friends

2631
01:53:50,350 --> 01:53:56,829
people are starving for this

2632
01:53:52,989 --> 01:53:58,719
conversation so you'll find that as you

2633
01:53:56,829 --> 01:54:00,699
have the courage to speak up about sex

2634
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:02,920
there's a lot of people really ready to

2635
01:54:00,699 --> 01:54:07,559
talk about it I think it's also worth

2636
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:12,100
pointing out that both shopping alone

2637
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:15,280
online for all sorts of sex fun toys and

2638
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:17,710
with a partner itself is a really fun

2639
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:20,349
foreplay there's there's like what the

2640
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:24,579
hell does this do there's giggling about

2641
01:54:20,350 --> 01:54:27,660
it and and it creates the opportunity to

2642
01:54:24,579 --> 01:54:30,699
talk about these things kind of like

2643
01:54:27,659 --> 01:54:32,229
like not a kind of third person right

2644
01:54:30,699 --> 01:54:34,840
there's there's there's two people

2645
01:54:32,229 --> 01:54:38,529
talking about sex toys but if it's two

2646
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:42,250
people looking at a website now you're

2647
01:54:38,529 --> 01:54:43,750
not necessarily talking about what you

2648
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:46,539
want actually youyou were talking about

2649
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:48,520
this this method earlier where you're

2650
01:54:46,539 --> 01:54:53,229
you're actually talking about the sex

2651
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:54,970
toys as eight as a third party thing not

2652
01:54:53,229 --> 01:54:57,909
necessarily what you want but what do

2653
01:54:54,970 --> 01:55:01,900
you think about this object and I think

2654
01:54:57,909 --> 01:55:04,599
that it allows a lot more vulnerability

2655
01:55:01,899 --> 01:55:07,019
to come out naturally and you can learn

2656
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:10,329
a lot about yourself and your partner

2657
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:12,130
totally totally and you know the

2658
01:55:10,329 --> 01:55:13,960
shopping experience can be a game you

2659
01:55:12,130 --> 01:55:16,510
can fill the shopping cart and then send

2660
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:19,029
a link and ask your partner to choose

2661
01:55:16,510 --> 01:55:23,199
one you can send your partner a gift

2662
01:55:19,029 --> 01:55:24,670
card to a you know and a lot there's sex

2663
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:26,889
toys on Amazon I would really recommend

2664
01:55:24,670 --> 01:55:30,220
going to a dedicated store because

2665
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:32,650
there's a lot of rip offs and like

2666
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:34,840
falsely advertised toys on Amazon so

2667
01:55:32,649 --> 01:55:35,589
avoid shopping there go to a sex toy

2668
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:37,150
store that can

2669
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:39,159
give you education a lot of them have

2670
01:55:37,149 --> 01:55:41,289
buying guides they'll walk you through

2671
01:55:39,158 --> 01:55:44,198
they've got videos there's tons of sex

2672
01:55:41,289 --> 01:55:48,010
toy reviewers so yeah you can make that

2673
01:55:44,198 --> 01:55:50,259
part of your exploration but also don't

2674
01:55:48,010 --> 01:55:52,360
get overwhelmed by all the options and

2675
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:55,780
go back to the question what do I want

2676
01:55:52,359 --> 01:55:57,759
to experience how do we want to connect

2677
01:55:55,779 --> 01:56:01,090
what kind of pleasures are we looking to

2678
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:04,719
explore because sex toys can also be a

2679
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:07,179
really generous declaration right like

2680
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:10,000
if you can't touch your partner in the

2681
01:56:07,179 --> 01:56:13,449
way you used to if your female partner

2682
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:16,420
loves having sex loves being penetrated

2683
01:56:13,448 --> 01:56:20,259
loves being filled up you're having

2684
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:23,618
erection issues like it is so sexy and

2685
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:25,659
confident to buy a toy and then use it

2686
01:56:23,618 --> 01:56:28,210
with her you know go down on her hold

2687
01:56:25,658 --> 01:56:32,289
the dildo and [ __ ] her silly that is no

2688
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:35,319
less sex than you having penis vaginal

2689
01:56:32,289 --> 01:56:39,000
intercourse right you're there you're

2690
01:56:35,319 --> 01:56:42,158
right face-first in her pleasure and

2691
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:46,090
that is like so liberating because all

2692
01:56:42,158 --> 01:56:48,219
of a sudden her getting well [ __ ] if

2693
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:51,550
you excuse my language her but her

2694
01:56:48,219 --> 01:56:53,198
pleasure being centered isn't contingent

2695
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:55,239
on whether or not your penis is getting

2696
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:57,039
hard in that very moment and your

2697
01:56:55,238 --> 01:56:59,709
medications are on point and your pain

2698
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:02,408
is manageable like we can't wait for

2699
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:04,989
conditions to be perfect so we need to

2700
01:57:02,408 --> 01:57:07,388
be flexible and have options and when we

2701
01:57:04,988 --> 01:57:10,598
get beyond the script options are

2702
01:57:07,389 --> 01:57:12,190
limitless lying with your partner as

2703
01:57:10,599 --> 01:57:14,279
they're touching themselves and having

2704
01:57:12,189 --> 01:57:17,979
an orgasm is one of the most intimate

2705
01:57:14,279 --> 01:57:20,460
vulnerable beautiful erotic acts and all

2706
01:57:17,979 --> 01:57:23,439
it requires of you is your presence I

2707
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:26,079
remember cracking up when I realized the

2708
01:57:23,439 --> 01:57:29,879
similarities there were between buying

2709
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:32,139
sex toys and buying like bongs and pipes

2710
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:35,109
because you know you men should go to a

2711
01:57:32,139 --> 01:57:37,090
you know go to a quality store right and

2712
01:57:35,109 --> 01:57:40,329
it's the same thing right like you know

2713
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:43,179
there are lots of online head shops that

2714
01:57:40,329 --> 01:57:46,000
have got like poorly produced pipes and

2715
01:57:43,179 --> 01:57:46,310
bowls that are crappy and thin glass and

2716
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,850
then

2717
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:51,800
and there are like really nice custom

2718
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:53,390
glass and they're made with care and

2719
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:58,550
there's stainless steel involved in this

2720
01:57:53,390 --> 01:58:00,230
so you know if you if you like good you

2721
01:57:58,550 --> 01:58:02,329
know bongs and pipes that are made with

2722
01:58:00,229 --> 01:58:04,549
quality and consider your usage of it

2723
01:58:02,329 --> 01:58:06,649
use that same headspace when you're

2724
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:11,690
going to buy your toys because you know

2725
01:58:06,649 --> 01:58:15,259
this is certainly a market where buying

2726
01:58:11,689 --> 01:58:17,089
quality is rewarded totally and you can

2727
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:19,610
have your own aesthetic with it right

2728
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:21,829
and your own point of pride right we're

2729
01:58:19,609 --> 01:58:24,859
all excited to show off our favorite

2730
01:58:21,829 --> 01:58:27,019
toys in the cannabis realm and share

2731
01:58:24,859 --> 01:58:28,639
them with friends and there's no shame

2732
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:33,170
in it right there's no like oh you have

2733
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:35,900
to use that device for pleasure oh I

2734
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:38,899
love my volcano and I love my Hitachi

2735
01:58:35,899 --> 01:58:41,629
Magic Wand and they both are both top of

2736
01:58:38,899 --> 01:58:43,519
the game device as I plug into the wall

2737
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:46,430
I use with intention and they create an

2738
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:48,260
experience for me we're taught a lot of

2739
01:58:46,430 --> 01:58:50,360
shame around sex and a lot of this thing

2740
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:54,199
of like which orgasms matter more and

2741
01:58:50,359 --> 01:58:58,309
what sex counts and if you're ill you

2742
01:58:54,199 --> 01:59:01,099
know I was out of the game for a while

2743
01:58:58,310 --> 01:59:03,080
right like if you're ill and you still

2744
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:06,680
want to connect you have to get creative

2745
01:59:03,079 --> 01:59:08,859
you have to be flexible and savor the

2746
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:11,600
moments that are shared right like that

2747
01:59:08,859 --> 01:59:14,599
lying with your partner just naked under

2748
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:16,730
three duvets if you're fully present to

2749
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:19,130
that it can be enough and it can be

2750
01:59:16,729 --> 01:59:21,019
enough to sustain you through that

2751
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:23,390
sexual season that might be incredibly

2752
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:25,370
fallow that might be very scary where

2753
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:28,220
you might not even have hope that you'll

2754
01:59:25,369 --> 01:59:32,359
be you know at the top of your game ever

2755
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:34,300
again but you can still sustain yourself

2756
01:59:32,359 --> 01:59:36,799
and then start building pleasure

2757
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:39,829
incrementally and maybe discover whole

2758
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:41,720
new arenas that you never even would

2759
01:59:39,829 --> 01:59:44,359
have considered if your script hadn't

2760
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:45,829
been you know torched for you and I

2761
01:59:44,359 --> 01:59:48,559
don't want to silver align this too much

2762
01:59:45,829 --> 01:59:49,819
being ill sucks being in pain sucks

2763
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:51,740
there are days where I just want to

2764
01:59:49,819 --> 01:59:53,779
throw my pain out the window like you're

2765
01:59:51,739 --> 01:59:56,189
not allowed to be a passenger in my life

2766
01:59:53,779 --> 01:59:58,800
anymore

2767
01:59:56,189 --> 02:00:00,869
for me if I engage with that with a

2768
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:02,699
really deep intention and presence and I

2769
02:00:00,869 --> 02:00:05,550
learned to work with my pain I call it

2770
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:08,550
doing BDSM with God right I'm like in it

2771
02:00:05,550 --> 02:00:10,860
I'm awake to it I'm not in the struggle

2772
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:12,810
of denial options start becoming

2773
02:00:10,859 --> 02:00:15,059
available to me what would help me or

2774
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:19,830
just how can I ride this how can I just

2775
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:22,650
be with what is even if it sucks it's

2776
02:00:19,829 --> 02:00:24,479
still better for me as a strategy than

2777
02:00:22,649 --> 02:00:26,729
struggling against what's true and

2778
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:28,559
wishing it where another way and you

2779
02:00:26,729 --> 02:00:30,569
know yeah then that's not gonna take us

2780
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,970
anywhere yeah yeah you know in this kind

2781
02:00:30,569 --> 02:00:35,460
this kind of exploration together or by

2782
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:37,230
oneself to be really renewing renewing

2783
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:39,869
of the relationship or even if there's

2784
02:00:37,229 --> 02:00:44,069
not another person just renewing of

2785
02:00:39,869 --> 02:00:46,349
one's own life and so for for you know

2786
02:00:44,069 --> 02:00:49,109
pain patients all patients and those who

2787
02:00:46,350 --> 02:00:51,329
love have them who you know have had

2788
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:52,649
we're gonna have a little success with

2789
02:00:51,329 --> 02:00:55,319
this and they want to explore more

2790
02:00:52,649 --> 02:00:58,409
together I enthusiastically recommend

2791
02:00:55,319 --> 02:01:00,599
Chris's podcast called speaking of sex

2792
02:00:58,409 --> 02:01:03,119
which is how I first learned of her

2793
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:05,340
listening to her show and learning a lot

2794
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:07,349
and learning a lot about poop you know

2795
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:09,569
techniques sure but like perspective how

2796
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:12,570
to think about this stuff so Chris um

2797
02:01:09,569 --> 02:01:14,699
you know me describing your show will

2798
02:01:12,569 --> 02:01:17,039
pale in comparison to you describing

2799
02:01:14,699 --> 02:01:19,170
your show so would you just take a

2800
02:01:17,039 --> 02:01:23,180
moment and tell folks about the show so

2801
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:25,890
they have an idea of what they would be

2802
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:28,860
you know checking out if they if they

2803
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:31,950
bother to go over there mmm I love how

2804
02:01:28,859 --> 02:01:34,099
you describe it you know a lot of what

2805
02:01:31,949 --> 02:01:36,929
we've been doing here it's explicit

2806
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:42,720
conversation about the heart of

2807
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:45,090
sexuality unashamed uncensored

2808
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:48,060
but with soul and reverence and

2809
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:50,579
heartfulness My partner and I have been

2810
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:53,660
together for 13 years and we co-host the

2811
02:01:50,579 --> 02:01:57,180
show and also bring on guests and

2812
02:01:53,659 --> 02:02:00,479
sometimes we do deep dives into topics

2813
02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:02,369
like libido and we do a ton of research

2814
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:04,589
and try to understand like what is

2815
02:02:02,369 --> 02:02:07,229
libido and how does it work and other

2816
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:09,970
times we'll do single episodes about a

2817
02:02:07,229 --> 02:02:13,419
new kind of sex toy or you know so it's

2818
02:02:09,970 --> 02:02:14,890
we have 370 episodes we've been going

2819
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:18,220
for years so there's something for

2820
02:02:14,890 --> 02:02:20,260
everyone the episodes are sorted in a

2821
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:22,060
sex index on our website pleasure

2822
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:24,850
mechanics comm so you can kind of find

2823
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:26,380
quickly topics you're looking for and

2824
02:02:24,850 --> 02:02:27,910
I'll also curate a little section

2825
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:29,289
that'll be on the show notes page here

2826
02:02:27,909 --> 02:02:32,139
because it can be overwhelming to get

2827
02:02:29,289 --> 02:02:33,789
started but yeah it's explicit yet

2828
02:02:32,140 --> 02:02:35,680
soulful is what kind of what we've come

2829
02:02:33,789 --> 02:02:40,029
down to some people call us the cooking

2830
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:41,980
show of sex it's like a wholesome but

2831
02:02:40,029 --> 02:02:46,090
queer and irreverent you know like we

2832

02:03:35,949 --> 02:03:40,869
between the speaking of sex podcast and

2855
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:42,550
the online class series that's on the

2856
02:03:40,869 --> 02:03:45,269
website mmm

2857
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:48,550
the speaking of sex podcast is free

2858
02:03:45,270 --> 02:03:50,580
there's 370 episodes to explore and

2859
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:53,380
those are deep dives you can learn a ton

2860
02:03:50,579 --> 02:03:55,840
I have people who write to me all the

2861
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:57,520
time who say their lives have been

2862
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:58,960
totally changed their marriages have

2863
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:00,850
been saved and all they've done is

2864
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:04,720
listen to the podcast and I'm delighted

2865
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:06,520
by that the online courses are there for

2866
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:09,510
you when you are ready for a deeper dive

2867
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:12,550
especially in learning new erotic skills

2868
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:15,460
so we're both trained in massage and

2869
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:17,560
then became somatic sex educators so

2870
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:20,199
there's a lot on this site about erotic

2871
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:23,650
touch from couples massage you know

2872
02:04:20,199 --> 02:04:26,349
full-body massages like when I was sick

2873
02:04:23,649 --> 02:04:29,649
but Charlotte's giving me just back and

2874
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:32,710
butt massage just like stroking my body

2875
02:04:29,649 --> 02:04:35,170
was how we sustained our love couples

2876
02:04:32,710 --> 02:04:38,260
massage is amazing or you might want to

2877
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:40,840
learn foreplay techniques and arousal

2878
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:43,600
techniques or erotic spanking and kink

2879
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:46,510
and so we teach that all we also have a

2880
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:49,420
class on mindful sex so those are guided

2881
02:04:46,510 --> 02:04:52,110
deep dives in erotic exploration and

2882
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:54,489
techniques they're all available online

2883
02:04:52,109 --> 02:04:55,420
accessible in your own home and then we

2884
02:04:54,489 --> 02:04:58,090
are there for you when you have

2885
02:04:55,420 --> 02:05:01,510
questions and need a little personal

2886
02:04:58,090 --> 02:05:03,159
coaching on how we do our thing and

2887
02:05:01,510 --> 02:05:05,530
we've been doing it for 10 years and go

2888
02:05:03,159 --> 02:05:09,399
in and we love this work because it just

2889
02:05:05,529 --> 02:05:11,259
allows us to you know zip into your life

2890
02:05:09,399 --> 02:05:13,179
as that little sex fairy that you know

2891
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:14,680
at the right time can be there for you

2892
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:16,810
with a conversation that you need to

2893
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:19,750
hear and just connect with you and let

2894
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:22,300
you know you're not alone so much of

2895
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:24,699
this is relieving that feeling of you

2896
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:26,500
know you being alone in this and that

2897
02:05:24,699 --> 02:05:28,840
there's no hope and there's no options

2898
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:30,960
there's so much possible for you no

2899
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:34,500
matter what's going on with your body I

2900
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:38,380
love you I am here with you in this

2901
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:40,779
human condition that can be so painful

2902
02:05:38,380 --> 02:05:43,060
but also so pleasurable and so beautiful

2903
02:05:40,779 --> 02:05:45,729
well hopefully we have been able to

2904
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:47,950
serve that vision in some small way here

2905
02:05:45,729 --> 02:05:50,199
today Chris thank you so much for

2906
02:05:47,949 --> 02:05:52,779
joining us I know that this is you know

2907
02:05:50,199 --> 02:05:54,849
a little atypical to come on a cannabis

2908
02:05:52,779 --> 02:05:57,759
show and and and to share this

2909
02:05:54,850 --> 02:06:00,789
experience but you know I've just I I've

2910
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:03,190
talked to enough patients where I knew

2911
02:06:00,789 --> 02:06:06,069
that I wanted to be able to bring this

2912
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:08,109
kind of perspective to them and and then

2913
02:06:06,069 --> 02:06:10,269
if they want to explore more it was an

2914
02:06:08,109 --> 02:06:12,309
option so I really appreciate you

2915
02:06:10,270 --> 02:06:15,040
sharing your time your expertise or good

2916
02:06:12,310 --> 02:06:17,920
