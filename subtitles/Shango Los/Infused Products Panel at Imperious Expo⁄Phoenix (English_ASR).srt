cannabis

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,299
elements so very happy to have this an

71
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,519
experience count-o how we're going to do

72
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,810
this is best series of questions we're

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,280
going to start in one end and then the

74
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,069
other and then hopefully enlisted a

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,169
little bit of conversations around um so

76
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:22,319
so let's get going so let's start with

77
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,679
you here Jane and then we'll work our

78
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,859
way down

79
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,930
oh I get that

80
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,240
point out that you know that the topic

81
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,400
is kind of general with designing and

82
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,629
marketing of Canada's imbue spot so

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,090
you'll notice a little bit of the

84
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:37,359
difference in the answers because Jane

85
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,789
and Nancy are both while they both are

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,860
topical thereafter teas and edibles

87
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,750
insurance on the end is more about

88
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,420
hopping so we're going to read a little

89
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,400
creative on how we work questions but

90
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:51,819
don't don't know understand long

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,069
so Jane patients require a wide range of

92
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,829
doses you know some as well as two and a

93
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:59,620
half milligrams and others do up to and

94
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,480
over a hundred milligrams of THC even

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,539
border before considering the CBD

96
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:07,719
component so you know from the hippies

97
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:09,729
of a product designer when designing a

98
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:11,709
limited range of products that are

99
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:14,889
getting going the market for public sale

100
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:17,889
what do you think are the best default

101
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:23,909
settings dosages to bring from market or

102
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:26,259
patient you want to thank you

103
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,340
initiatives in Russia Asia

104
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:35,819
our products are five milligrams

105
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:44,279
and our high grams chopped apart and I

106
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:51,829
often take people on the chocolate a

107
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:51,829
hundred days of Bari have many of their

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:02,639
problems every letter but I for me

109
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,540
unless the pages in 104 I do have an

110
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,289
important occasion

111
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,870
I generally started by going over 2.5

112
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:15,840
cement I medicate the station at night

113
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:18,090
for 10 days so then I'm heading

114
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,279
information at night for 10 days the

115
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:22,349
best observer in their age is never have

116
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,989
hands before and then that makes a

117
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:31,129
transition someday a lot emails are not

118
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,129
white and do not to me you have to do it

119
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,059
it might not be everyone so so to

120
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,709
reorient you had independent when

121
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,810
designed products for the market

122
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,759
specifically because patients leave such

123
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,199
a wide range how do you know what

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,349
milligrams bring the market that's idiot

125
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:51,529
emotionally so you know we have two

126
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:55,280
options with the Kiva confessions

127
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:58,849
they're danced by milligram auctioneer

128
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:02,599
and family as a treatment and Russian

129
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:07,370
whatever that movies the people is

130
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:10,160
coming in as recreation you have to camp

131
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:14,959
artists if you sign up into what you

132
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,100
know so for example when I get like

133
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,049
people are home

134
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,110
it's unfortunate I love Graham swear

135
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:28,280
that I have a perimeter is 50 milligrams

136
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:31,460
of mind to iron my wall so something

137
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,709
your answer is on subdivide Bowl Noah

138
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:38,629
grant in whatever the product is right

139
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:41,120
great okay well to some sort of an

140
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:44,810
interesting question there's certainty

141
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,319
murder fest in this one is the dotage of

142
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:51,918
the individual donated products and in

143
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,740
Colorado we are mandated by law on the

144
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,729
adult side of the market so you have a

145
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,600
maximum of 100

146
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:03,600
the products on the right side and they

147
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,750
have to be 28 into no more than 10

148
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,530
milligrams unit so that part of the

149
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,170
dissent Stone Medical has more

150
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:17,579
flexibility now we have chosen to have a

151
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:20,670
range of dosages within our digital

152
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:24,870
products and we have a line of gummies

153
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:28,650
and heart lozenges and caramels and

154
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,209
other confectionery we have an option

155
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:33,299
the real answer

156
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:36,149
shondo is that only really truly know

157
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,000
what is most I could do because there's

158
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:40,649
something variables to that there's

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,709
individual metabolism there is the

160
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:48,049
condition that they treated their how

161
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:50,819
the body processes animal so our our

162
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,520
philosophy is to provide people with a

163
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,920
range of options so that they can

164
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,709
experiment and see with me what works

165
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:03,360
for them that we currently have products

166
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:07,209
that are 28 + 2 5 10 and 20 milligrams

167
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,689
division and we rough amount

168
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:15,250
Micra just a two-week time so I think

169
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:19,329
our basic a lot to be and what we help

170
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,870
promote the industry is start low and go

171
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:22,990
slow

172
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,240
is it not completely for people who are

173
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,460
new to candidates and vehicles

174
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,319
the last thing the probably wanted

175
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:32,348
somebody has not uncomfortable as

176
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,418
barriers to that and so we spend a lot

177
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,959
of time out of the field talking about

178
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:40,658
tenders about animal metabolism and how

179
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,819
people experience them and how they

180
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:45,278
should be working with their patients

181
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,580
and their customers and because of

182
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,889
Colorado Minnesota State and we're

183
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,830
particularly going to live to torrent

184
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:56,500
and movie who really have a child a

185
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,810
little thing work and always really

186
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,879
encouraging people to start low and

187
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:07,389
guess what their body can tolerate

188
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:12,669
before having a hundred kind of our

189
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:16,480
quantity on sure yet so careful to be an

190
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:19,459
apple into their hands I wanted over the

191
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,470
last two thousand five of and

192
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:27,889
or relationships and network that I

193
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:32,649
don't like go under 45 percent online

194
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:38,750
per unit for example in either CVD or

195
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:42,200
change in 2003 fabulous about a decision

196
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:45,769
that said I won't like you and on the

197
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:52,820
edibles because I love them starting at

198
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:54,049
you would punch 5mm there it's

199
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,180
interesting because one how's the

200
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:59,028
edibles you know there seems to be a lot

201
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,909
of the needs for variety up to around 25

202
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:03,889
milligrams people sweet spot you know

203
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:05,958
they went be at two point five and it

204
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:08,000
might be at 15 and sometimes this

205
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:10,278
different depending on who they're

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,799
purchasing from so there's a lot of a

207
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:15,679
lot of different than me up to 25 but if

208
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,689
something these above 25 milligram a

209
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,569
chances are likely that they are eating

210
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,550
to taste so much GHD to deal with no

211
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,890
kitronik pain or whatever their issue is

212
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:27,379
that they're probably gaining home and

213
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,899
so fast that third you know they're

214
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:31,610
gonna really be dating art and so these

215
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:34,278
are the people who take you know 100

216
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,680
milligram hard break it in half and half

217
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,629
now half later and so as far as the

218
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,819
product designer goes it sounds like has

219
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:45,919
a lot of variety of low end and it going

220
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,430
slow and great start Monica yeah there

221
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,169
you go

222
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,399
the silicon still know where we can

223
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:51,379
start on the other night so this much

224
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,990
for you trip this so so as far as on

225
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:56,028
infuse topicals go you know Canada stop

226
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,028
them to become very popular through pain

227
00:10:56,028 --> 00:11:00,590
relief but there's a lot of debate in

228
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:03,259
with product designer

229
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:06,680
that carrier oils are because some are

230
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:08,809
seeking to be on top of the derma for

231
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:11,149
some little writes that hang them up red

232
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:13,039
others who are self for pain early and

233
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,409
so you have to break through the derma

234
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,169
so I'd like to hear from you when your

235
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:19,699
are on carrier oils for both of those

236
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:22,699
applications and then we'll come this

237
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:27,440
direction up great so I first like you

238
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:31,460
probably one for an emergency room is

239
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:35,150
one towards faster than better than an

240
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,500
ER well however you come to the MoMA so

241
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,740
you have to choose a different sugar

242
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,220
little Cupid you lots of people like to

243
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,879
use coconut oil grapeseed oil I've heard

244
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:53,960
noggin I will but first one is my

245
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:55,399
favorite because it's light and I hope

246
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,040
you all are doing pop this with your

247
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,039
label we are an object optical and

248
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:10,190
we have Ungerman store in come in and

249
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,359
what the question they are thoughtful is

250
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,430
they're expensive

251
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,159
is there a chance without a builder to

252
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:19,578
this console and I always try to stop

253
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:22,490
them and say you're asking the person is

254
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:25,789
because we're in - you can step all

255
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,539
night so nothing's really no canvas up

256
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:32,448
but you know I try it ejected Lee most

257
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:36,139
of the canvas oil the knowledge is

258
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:39,758
basically an amenity times not topics in

259
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:42,019
the room until I come back

260
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,480
and I guess for a lot of patience no

261
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:47,120
stability is a big deal so especially

262
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,639
trying to get relief water bed work in a

263
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:56,139
collection Avenue I don't see your eyes

264
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:56,139
lips actually because they are smart and

265
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:04,899
users who are super to use our products

266
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,899
are not normally

267
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:14,539
codify necklace okay so in baseless is a

268
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:17,028
crystalline power form of just teach the

269
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:19,328
a or sweetie

270
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:23,139
I like using they don't smell like

271
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:26,048
whether that said most of the people

272
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:30,509
really capable really doesn't canvas on

273
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:36,679
the other form and we thought at first

274
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:39,769
we find the Gateway Eileen

275
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,769
[Music]

276
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:48,430
any any idea so what happened is is that

277
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,460
she's using the the CBD here in the CBD

278
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:53,169
or th da that's been blatantly separated

279
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,430
from the rest of the whole plant and so

280
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:56,529
you're not getting to the terpene

281
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:59,199
profile which is the aromatherapy of the

282
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:01,539
plan right and so she knows specifically

283
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,270
that she's are want to use th ba and or

284
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:07,149
CBD in reply so if you peel off the

285
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:09,939
terpenes in that day it doesn't and you

286
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,919
can use the positive aspects she's going

287
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,810
with but without without the smell that

288
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,289
would let lets your co-workers know with

289
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:21,009
the three and pardon us because the such

290
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:22,799
a little in use in my product also

291
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:25,389
nitrogen profiles that are beneficial

292
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:29,049
for pain inflammation is a trauma

293
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:31,389
so it's combining the three classic

294
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:36,729
energy in the formulation to clinical

295
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:39,159
depression great so much in Virginia you

296
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:43,149
know do you make a fifty-fifty Hanako

297
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:51,769
happy de I know it is what is it going

298
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:56,870
to mmm P and we're a really long time

299
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:59,159
made it work for everything right right

300
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,279
so so this next question we'll start

301
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,929
with immunity so so we're an

302
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,850
international day so we're going to

303
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:08,219
primarily I'm going to ask the question

304
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,759
in a way that we be speaking about

305
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,649
patience right but I know that you're

306
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,629
you working a lot of black market so

307
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:19,319
feel free to you know speak to that as

308
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:21,570
well but one be my I do not have infused

309
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,910
product manufacturers using artificial

310
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,480
ingredients of their products you know

311
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:30,419
colors sometimes they're using sugar and

312
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,860
it will talk about patient that's not

313
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:33,389
necessarily going to be best for

314
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,480
something with a compromised immune

315
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:39,000
system so in your experience how

316
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,820
important is it to avoid artificial

317
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,799
colors and flavors and sugar using these

318
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,170
inputs when making commercially

319
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,839
available edibles for the greater market

320
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:51,179
we all know that lots of people are

321
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,750
getting authorization and using medical

322
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:56,879
products or for light enjoyment as well

323
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,820
but in because we are here in Arizona

324
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:04,230
we're taking primarily in a medical way

325
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:07,129
so so please it's an eating question and

326
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:11,180
I will answer the couple different ways

327
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:13,769
the first is that there's actually

328
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:17,458
objective data that you

329
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:20,999
to be here tomorrow with Joe Harris from

330
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:23,628
be an analytic community speaking there

331
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:27,028
have been so I'm from Colorado in and

332
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:29,670
worse than Colorado Boulder and having

333
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:33,659
cancer at all things politically correct

334
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:35,639
and if it's at all natural so if there

335
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,249
was ever a place in the universe where

336
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:42,269
there's going to be people pushing back

337
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:43,769
on artisan colors and flavors and all

338
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:46,828
the rest of that it would be Boulder

339
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:50,188
Colorado and I have to tell you that I

340
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:52,979
definitely see images with you before as

341
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:55,379
all use in doesn't matter than most

342
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,749
people truthfully people will say it

343
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,509
matters but when it comes to what people

344
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:03,420
actually purchase we all know that we're

345
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:05,838
not a piece of dip right there are

346
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:09,058
plenty of products out there that have

347
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:12,208
artificial colors or flavors and

348
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:15,148
certainly almost every popular edible

349
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:19,649
product in Colorado has sugar mine

350
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:22,859
included and they all do just fine being

351
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:29,278
in the track sooner free product it

352
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:33,449
barely a blip on the screen of what is

353
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:35,759
sold so you know you guys can draw your

354
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:39,538
own conclusions about what I'm saying

355
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:43,108
certainly a perfect world if you are

356
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:46,349
compromised immune system or medical

357
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:49,678
issues in a perfect world it's probably

358
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:51,689
best to avoid all of those things on the

359
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,210
other hand if you're even coming this

360
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,999
this big I don't know that's a huge

361
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,950
shift personally if for some patients

362
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:02,389
the only way they can have be palatable

363
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:06,509
but they gain I am that's right yes yeah

364
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:09,148
so I I do adding a page when I'm

365
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:12,628
faulting them and I ask them what kind

366
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:17,128
of dietary decisions they develop on and

367
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:19,949
then I just call their lead and you know

368
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:22,048
there's teachers and honey you know

369
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,210
kinda animals that unions in cages that

370
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:28,710
are you know gateway sugar

371
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:31,098
um but I kinda concur with her even

372
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,619
though you know on the encirclement and

373
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:38,158
non-gmo organic defense rating them I

374
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:41,658
get quite like that but my little

375
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,659
fifteen now in the dark

376
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,970
Winston Churchill adjacent our

377
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:04,950
convenience helpers are genetically done

378
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:13,759
if I they were hot for the skin healthy

379
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:22,830
I need to put a German and a lap but

380
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:25,619
yeah a senior honey um since you're all

381
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:27,689
business people since you're here I'm

382
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:31,319
going to contextualise this little bit

383
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,210
worse business point of view even though

384
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,389
that wasn't exactly the question I

385
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:40,529
recognize that when you step back and

386
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:43,530
look at animal torture right now it's

387
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:45,599
not a highly segmented market and what I

388
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:47,809
mean by that is you know I have people

389
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:53,939
who come to me with some regularity

390
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:55,919
almost whispering things I have and I'm

391
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,580
always very polite and you know I think

392
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,500
you know unless ones like NBA with me

393
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:02,779
don't even tells me but they don't want

394
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,170
to tell us

395
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:08,629
and they do and always something closing

396
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:13,519
this she like it's working on a team

397
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:16,310
laws as you know and and what I really

398
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:19,009
want to say to that generally is into

399
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:21,980
the world you might have an issue that I

400
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:24,170
in the cannabis world you're going to go

401
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,750
out of business in about a month right

402
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:29,900
because the industry just isn't

403
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:33,680
segmented enough at this point of time

404
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,680
and the market is large enough for us to

405
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,330
have all these different locations so we

406
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,940
all want to do good in the world

407
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:42,259
but right now doing good in the proteins

408
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,630
that you have to stay afloat as a

409
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:48,799
business right so you have to take that

410
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:50,900
reality into account you know before you

411
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,079
come out with products that are so super

412
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,930
an issue that there just isn't enough of

413
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,789
a market to support them that's kind of

414
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,470
business reality island from my

415
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,359
perceptive yeah I think that's a good

416
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,579
way I was down in California speaking

417
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,839
and Buddha gave me a sample which ended

418
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:08,480
up being the best out of what I've ever

419
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:12,679
had and it was instead of fun version

420
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,839
and so it was the Persian style jelly

421
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,670
and it was delicious

422
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,889
I had want to do the fact that it was

423
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,590
Persian style jelly that it was again as

424
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,030
edible but when the packaging you know

425
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:24,500
we talked about in each of the niche

426
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,470
market first of all you have to know

427
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,940
what gives you is and then you have

428
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:34,569
joining in your candidates out of the

429
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:37,509
jelly so delicious so so so so Jane what

430
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:39,308
the challenges with marketing topical to

431
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:42,128
that patients want to use it sparingly

432
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:44,259
to save money and yet the whole thing

433
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:47,888
with topical that you maybe use

434
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:50,980
regularly throughout the day so you know

435
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:54,778
you work a lot with patients what part

436
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:58,240
of anything that you can share about

437
00:21:54,778 --> 00:22:01,359
encouraging patient compliance to use

438
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,128
the topical when they're at with a ton

439
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:07,778
of trying to save money but I'm not

440
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:11,109
using pop so I have a strange analogy

441
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:12,970
link you to paint in the night when they

442
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:15,428
come into the first time and I tell them

443
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:20,169
they're like a car with a lever base and

444
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:26,129
the one hanging image so I tell them on

445
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:30,370
that TV and should not reward if you're

446
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:32,829
division for 30 days you need to get at

447
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:35,500
least 30 days and I compare it I did

448
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:37,538
this here we are on Amol online okay

449
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,460
you're going to be delivered a much

450
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:41,609
bigger bag to me you don't know if your

451
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,350
body's working that you know we

452
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:47,329
translation so I get them on

453
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:50,000
and then I start talking about computing

454
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:53,359
job will turn around I say to them you

455
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,849
know it dis is best used when your pores

456
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,399
are open after a shower or you can grab

457
00:22:55,849 --> 00:23:01,609
a few mama tell you have gone through

458
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,600
the top lock don't make that resolve for

459
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:08,869
three to five days start unit using at

460
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:11,779
night for good reason I want you to know

461
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:15,759
they it determine our offices you got it

462
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:19,250
is not but I don't set any false

463
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,869
expectations I don't plan out and I

464
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:26,240
teach fourth grade I am that

465
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:28,969
authoritative here waitress but they

466
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,279
understand and they don't go home and

467
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:35,179
call me the nine days day Almighty eat

468
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:39,048
it work because they know they know you

469
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:41,630
can take time so when people come in the

470
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:43,429
day I'm heated here is I did / call my

471
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,440
prescriptions down the mother and our

472
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:48,080
people disappoint because you're going

473
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,830

and so I say to people sure you on in

475
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:58,009
Kansas to musicals you give it a month

476
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,379
two months three months and three months

477
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:02,900
reaching which is quantity and

478
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:06,740
accommodation where your reduced rate

479
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:09,620
you know if you have minimum but you

480
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:12,079
know everything takes time it took you

481
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:14,959
time to get a big to develop it and you

482
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,809
can try to get you off focus people want

483
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,890
instance

484
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:21,419
all digital media and I'm sorry but we

485
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,410
going to go back to the lighting crane

486
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:27,330
right now because you get all these

487
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,620
candies knocked at the Furious equipment

488
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:32,730
did you want to lay it let me go

489
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:36,539
corollary to this so we don't have a

490
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:38,579
chuckles but we do have a family of

491
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:41,099
extended-release castle to my knowledge

492
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:43,849
the only and release castle on the

493
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:46,679
market but it is the theory to the more

494
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:49,199
things which aim is talking about that

495
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,750
we have to do a lot of training with you

496
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,980
to understand and we need to build up

497
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:59,670
your system so for any amenities product

498
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:03,720
not just for Canada so I think it's an

499
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:05,610
expectation is the key to having you

500
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,769
have successful experiences with these

501
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:15,689
types of products the un's is love I run

502
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:18,359
this a lot so you know everybody

503
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,759
different so for some people they apply

504
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:27,599
the oil and women in it would be a

505
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:30,240
bigger problem my patience that's it

506
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,659
we have a location to let us know that

507
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:37,490
it took three days for them to get labs

508
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:42,930
and results and what analysis were the

509
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:44,289
analogy is that your honor than analysis

510
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,990
needs to be boosted

511
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,099
people are tradition right so when

512
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,650
you're applying them when you're

513
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:53,469
applying about the products to treat you

514
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,480
know pain your inhalation what you're

515
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,559
doing is in through here by ability to

516
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,299
take care of itself

517
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,819
in that spot over and over and over

518
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:02,919
again so the client you know classes up

519
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:04,539
at the day in the beginning will allow

520
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,670
the mutton cooling afternoon once or

521
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:11,289
twice a day or every other day you know

522
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:14,310
two weeks later so little analysis okay

523
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:18,369
when you were designing your packaging

524
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:22,029
how would you weigh how to you know

525
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:25,629
explain the usage of it because you want

526
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:27,970
them enough compliance that it helps we

527
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,700
also don't want to say that small feet

528
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,289
on weeks so don't want to wait it out

529
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,870
for yourself or the package suppliers

530
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:38,710
well that's a great question

531
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:39,099
so I recommend a cleanser put it where

532
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,990
it hurts

533
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:48,168
coming in pratik right

534
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:52,450
the most oxygen at maths and interaction

535
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:57,470
by my package it says to bury me I

536
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:59,269
guarantee ya soul on this next question

537
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,970
rift certainly at that problems that

538
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:04,099
were back here done in from this way so

539
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,190
I know this is kind of general question

540
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:09,379
but when were to elicit conversation so

541
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:12,350
so for generations infused products were

542
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:15,559
made from trim which until recently with

543
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:18,589
no tracks right and I hope you can do it

544
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:20,960
but today now infused product designers

545
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:22,849
have an array of mirin materials that

546
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,308
they can choose from they can go from

547
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:28,158
trims a whole flower to purchasing

548
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:30,829
extracted would added product designer

549
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,289
you've got a lot of options so so what

550
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:36,139
advice would you offer a hot designer in

551
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:38,408
the room considering one material to use

552
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:41,330
for their in cheese box

553
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:45,080
well the first thing to the pieman have

554
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:48,168
a sooner source so even into your mind

555
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:51,319
extracted oil you go to the farm labor

556
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:53,270
map check out another grown package of

557
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:56,960
large be how they care for their plant

558
00:27:53,269 --> 00:28:01,339
see what kind of chemicals even that

559
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:07,149
trying to or DNA really where that right

560
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:07,148
so no you know you're producing that

561
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,139
it's actually a very interesting

562
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,319
question so even in visiting Colorado

563
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,929
since 2010 and back in the day there was

564
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,149
no extract as well that you can buy and

565
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:25,490
I would like it into our Katie before in

566
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:27,409
Motor Company you said I want to build

567
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,230
cars you believe this fantastic first

568
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:33,289
you need to learn onyx deal right but

569
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,240
now we have choices so one of the

570
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:38,798
answers to the question depends on what

571
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,950
it is that you're trying to do so

572
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,779
Trixie was talking before about I slid

573
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,819
which are the purest format you can get

574
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:50,389
the other big trend in let's see right

575
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:52,609
now is dead fluid which is usually we

576
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,530
start out with an extract said well you

577
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:57,500
know co2 would extract the oil is the

578
00:28:54,529 --> 00:29:00,259
most general one in Egypt and secondary

579
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,880
technique which is called twelve ounces

580
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:04,129
which there's actually a variety of ways

581
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,340
to do this solution I mean with it the

582
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:10,250
strips out after the chlorophyll it

583
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:12,649
opens ourselves to some church okay and

584
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,808
the turkey in addition to adding smell

585
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:18,950
to the product although we have

586
00:29:14,808 --> 00:29:21,529
traditional data set and and they're

587
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:25,370
also the determinant of whether an

588
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:26,359
individual like indica or sativa feels

589
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:28,729
like a sativa

590
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:31,699
so what you're trying to make in the

591
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,349
class specific animal that has some

592
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,480
properties in it

593
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:39,319
pima's not cultivated we can talk about

594
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,089
later too but you wouldn't want to use

595
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:45,048
an extracted well that had gone through

596
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:47,990
this process you either want to extract

597
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:51,349
it yourself or you want to buy will be a

598
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:53,359
lot of collocation around so there's

599
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:57,379
that variable on what you're trying to

600
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:59,599
do that the other issue is just what

601
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,270
what are your capabilities as it

602
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:06,829
happening to do your own extraction

603
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:10,759
requires equipment a recorded guilt that

604
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:13,908
and the requires more time so you know

605
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:16,759
we read you about my extraction of oil

606
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:19,070
devices live and we also have co2

607
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:22,400
extractors and four years ago mutating

608
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:24,558
structures which we chose taken down but

609
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,830
you know one of the things that happened

610
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:30,019
is capture for you to the first level

611
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:32,899
extraction with the trend whether you're

612
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:35,569
using co2 or whether using solvent

613
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,820
systems work a level secondary process

614
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:40,308
that has to happen where your winter on

615
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:43,879
your removing the black soot and it has

616
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:46,970
a lot of time to the process so if

617
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,490
you're very kind of all you company like

618
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,680
we are there is a big advantage to you

619
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,599
and extract oil and using the

620
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,330
tell me some of the properties with the

621
00:30:53,599 --> 00:31:01,069
turkey that had these things up

622
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:05,269
instantly so it is not the home great

623
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:07,549
for answer real answer is it depends if

624
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:11,119
you are trying to get what we call the

625
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:13,730
entourage effect or get the added

626
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:20,269
everything the plans that you probably

627
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:24,319
wanted to your attraction to yoga so I'm

628
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:27,889
in a dingy John here I am you know this

629
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:32,569
years ago in a hand would you be trim

630
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:35,180
today I don't know but that right now

631
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:38,599
you're had an engineering major animals

632
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:42,350
at random or is there deserve reason why

633
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:47,149
that you're worth what number one you

634
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:50,419
know it quality and call me up and quit

635
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:53,690
I laugh on it look at like how to trim

636
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,830
that was one out semantical place it is

637
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,620
not a pretty sight

638
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:59,259
does not believe that the people that

639
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:02,229
are successful

640
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:03,629
you that padded on occasion Colorado

641
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,819
Japan to give a different perspective

642
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:10,900
most ethical companies in Colorado still

643
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:13,029
make your edibles from trim and they

644
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,429
extracted themselves really the

645
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:19,269
extracted oil industry is just starting

646
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:21,910
to really take hold in Colorado and to

647
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:24,609
have an option that larger companies are

648
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:30,029
looking at it obediently absolutely

649
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:36,029
beautiful trim with love THC and CBD

650
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:38,529
that rival you know a whole plant and

651
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:40,450
you know you get more on the coal plant

652
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,558
that you have to pay for a lot of times

653
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,798
much for it

654
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:47,609
so from an economics point of view I

655
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:51,579
would say if you're not in a state that

656
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:54,579
has a robot extracted oil awesome for

657
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:59,980
you jump shy away from trim it's a great

658
00:32:54,579 --> 00:33:02,379
way to point right have to know your

659
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,120
source be added even within any

660
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,770
particular state you can have people who

661
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,739
are producing high-quality trim and

662
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:11,289
beloved wishes my life over tracks right

663
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,980
grant oh so now I know your source and

664
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:17,019
then go to the facility and see how to

665
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,808
get you to rate the loan

666
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:21,819
time for able to quickly learn up one of

667
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:24,369
the things that we do in trend I highly

668
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:26,980
encourage anybody issues into Genesis we

669
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:30,219
track and measure every possible metric

670
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:33,400
there is contra we measure the potency

671
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:36,610
we measure the smell of color

672
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:40,120
the final meal after which rise

673
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:42,039
everything is measured as - the strain

674
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:45,459
levels so when were negotiating prices

675
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:48,250
on shrimp we do if Rene's a lot of mal

676
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,679
chattel over target I want to clarify

677
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,599
the loading remember ultimately I think

678
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,400
that you're talking about changers

679
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:57,730
active everything ships not moving

680
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:01,000
traveling directly to main thread yes

681
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:06,700
and and you're talking about lying to me

682
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:09,639
turning it into an extract right so I

683
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:13,300
you into an oil user by clicking a photo

684
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:17,740
like in other words people that trying

685
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:22,470
to visit don't use trim just straight up

686
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:22,469
meeting product to product

687
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:35,668
yeah yeah it is and to know this so you

688
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:37,769
can use pesticide on flower or other

689
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:41,239
plant and have their flower path or

690
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:44,219
pesticide test but the German will pass

691
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:48,059
so be really careful about that field

692
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:51,449
you know Emporium in the strictest test

693
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:53,489
regulation of the nation and it's really

694
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:58,618
important that we as we mature in our

695
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:59,579
life so they will start with you on this

696
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,358
last question

697
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:05,039
so what consideration should use product

698
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:11,489
designers think about when it comes to

699
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:14,039
shelf-life that's a great one so we

700
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:17,519
first started out we have in our lineup

701
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:19,949
a variety of base good and under time we

702
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,599
completely phase them out because we

703
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:24,269
found the arts we thought was really

704
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:29,119
things that have long shelf life the

705
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:31,858
only way that we could figure out how to

706
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,280
make a brownie class from where the two

707
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:38,000
weeks is with a multimeter

708
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:40,790
we didn't want to do now that said I

709
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,940
have good friends in the industry who do

710
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:47,690
they taste good and they have to get out

711
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:50,119
somehow and shelf-life we never did

712
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:53,450
so we dealt with as much as a great

713
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:55,909
whole thing so we just everything is one

714
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:58,639
of our core criteria for salon Jeanne

715
00:35:55,909 --> 00:36:01,909
process is that it has a shelf life of

716
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:06,920
at least six months and we also do shelf

717
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:09,199
like testings we actually when you're

718
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,250
making products we actually have a

719
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:16,179
little thing that we put in many kind of

720
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:18,769
simulates different durations long shelf

721
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:21,230
so it's a really really important

722
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:24,320
consideration in a state like ours which

723
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:26,539
is a fairly good-sized obtain for us to

724
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,150
get out to the western slope which is

725
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:32,179
you know we're in folders so that's a

726
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:35,510
good five to six hour drive we're only

727
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:38,419
sending our couriers or outside couriers

728
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,640
out there once a week so you know we

729
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,070
have a product that begins to get

730
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:46,009
stamper to week you're going to end up

731
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,610
having customers in on station we're not

732
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:54,220
very happy with it

733
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:57,640
so we have a we have a small basis and

734
00:36:54,219 --> 00:37:00,489
under mm perfect so when we order at

735
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:02,529
home and I'm not by much comprised of

736
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:05,379
German surprise Malo the kitchen

737
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:09,220
it's only a week order and we turn on

738
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:11,740
the bevel living [ __ ] and it's kind of

739
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:14,049
amazing to me how badly the patients are

740
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:18,759
because I am a the other day in LA

741
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:22,720
because ml by month if you have picture

742
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:25,500
is impression they know anyone and you

743
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,719
know you don't have to move to keep

744
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:32,170
those work in our favor that we turn me

745
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,299
on that plane and I don't want to camp

746
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,389
around the inside is actually a really

747
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:42,070
good it really is like a retailers right

748
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:44,529
because if your distributor is willing

749
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,670
to deliver to you more often it not only

750
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:50,380
does it mean that you got thresher

751
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:52,030
products but also your revenue stream is

752
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,769
going to be more balanced because you're

753
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,110
not putting out larger sums of money

754
00:37:53,769 --> 00:38:00,449
every two weeks it's a consistent amount

755
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:03,730
that's really a cycle just Imani happen

756
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:08,289
so top it with a little bit difference

757
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:11,409
again not our Boyle County or someone

758
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:14,769
deletes I'm usually important I'm

759
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:17,139
currently working on lotion and

760
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:18,400
not put after ingredient coalition and

761
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:24,789
how to have a great shelf life is

762
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:27,190
actually pretty challenging so I think I

763
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:31,679
found what we need in order to do it

764
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:35,289
naturally loop with punch right service

765
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,940
bubbling out then right on

766
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:38,739
so again Patrick all questions do we

767
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,369
have a yes

768
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:46,169
when I stand on the feet up in is a

769
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:50,200
really big part of the West's job and

770
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:52,599
what you guys recommend Adam education

771
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:55,029
for dyslexia and what you go are you

772
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,219
about doing that was the best way to get

773
00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:02,760
make sure that about your Australian

774
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:02,759
arms in the proper way but fortunately I

775
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,630
can manage on that were actually the

776
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:13,809
process of building out a much more

777
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:16,030
in-depth training programs and we go

778
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:20,380
into the dispensaries and do much

779
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:23,528
entertaining and adventury and we're

780
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:27,789
actually partnering with that

781
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:31,309
in my own company to really help them

782
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:35,210
understand not just the basics of you

783
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:36,920
know start or go slow but really helping

784
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,460
them understand how animals are

785
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,099
metabolized in the body and in a little

786
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,460
bit deeper into that now in Colorado we

787
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:50,359
have some very large very large content

788
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:53,170
as well you know 15 17 store chain and

789
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:56,028
they do have a lot more training

790
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:58,670
material themselves but the average

791
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:59,449
smaller dispensary chains were the wrong

792
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,278
ones

793
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:03,679
in general I think it's the

794
00:40:01,278 --> 00:40:06,048
responsibility of manufacturers to be

795
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,808
bringing that information to them and

796
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:13,309
helping them do the very best apt for

797
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:15,769
their customers I agree also and after

798
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:17,539
that we go to the winter training both

799
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:19,489
in the dispensaries that we're all

800
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:22,730
driven program where we're bringing in

801
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:25,358
at our facility and take off teaching

802
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,358
classes there

803
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:33,679
so we have a hotel team they go down and

804
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:36,139
they do they do giveaways and they

805
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:39,139
educate by gender disability and

806
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:44,598
education but in their timing if I'm

807
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:52,539
saying give me the quality good your

808
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:57,980
budget isn't talking dimension a lot in

809
00:40:52,539 --> 00:41:01,519
general immediately a lot more awareness

810
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:04,010
intervene on view courses you're

811
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:07,880
currently market for you will see there

812
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:10,490
being market for edible infused products

813
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,690
with other cannabinoids as I played for

814
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:17,769
an entire spectrum absolutely guaranteed

815
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:19,880
question yeah yeah he's billion

816
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:24,039
basically what he happens is there a

817
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,030
market for other cannabinoids and

818
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:28,670
specifically other now I didn't use

819
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:31,940
products and absolutely the answer that

820
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:35,300
I can find both PvP and PvE that realize

821
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:39,740
my product as well so one of the things

822
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:42,500
that happening on the extraction worlds

823
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:44,568
is that people the ability to extract

824
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,599
getting more precise

825
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:49,308
and so they are beginning to be able to

826
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,588
consistently pull off the other

827
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:54,589
cannabinoid at least some of them

828
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:57,349
there's 100 three of them so but I'm CVG

829
00:41:54,588 --> 00:42:00,889
PDMP you know the Chief Justice

830
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:03,259
mentioned and be queer the future of the

831
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:06,498
industry is coming and animals included

832
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:09,019
is to really leverage that is only to

833
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:11,659
extract precisely and then just stop

834
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:14,389
things the different ratios to attract

835
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:17,838
democratical concerns and creates to the

836
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:19,818
big experiences now that I think we're

837
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,548
quite a ways away from being able to

838
00:42:19,818 --> 00:42:24,949
Jian effectively because we don't really

839
00:42:22,548 --> 00:42:26,958
have a lot of experience or database of

840
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:31,400
duty time yet but that's where it's

841
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:33,739
going if you look at very conditional

842
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:38,168
products you know you see it's our

843
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:42,048
galaxy HP in Fiji LAFD be an acylium

844
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:45,650
paas they industry is moving and you

845
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:47,778
know you can you can come up with all

846
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:50,179
these types of do wonderful things but

847
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:52,639
until you and I look into this

848
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:54,798
contenders to talk about they're going

849
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,018
to sit there so you not be careful they

850
00:42:54,798 --> 00:42:59,809
can comes open up too early with that

851
00:42:57,018 --> 00:43:05,418
each product tree without the education

852
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:07,219
like research to back so you know a lot

853
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:10,089
of people with a lot of good intentions

854
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:14,230
are way ahead of time

855
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:17,170
point it you're going to design product

856
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,360
that it is using a minor cannabinoid

857
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:22,510
make sure you know your suppliers in the

858
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,550
same business to you the I thought that

859
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,830
happened in Oregon totally came out as a

860
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:28,960
really great CDN tab that helps you go

861
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:30,039
to sleep and then they started selling

862
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,990
the heck out of them and then there's a

863
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:35,170
fireman under and known as well as

864
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:37,299
escalating CBM so that we have got time

865
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:41,440
for over budget desert who makes your

866
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:45,400
progress let me get let me sirs on what

867
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,550
makes that product we begin to create to

868
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,369
do to the word and Medicaid would fax

869
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:54,720
your foundation that this is a medical

870
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:57,639
product it's really a regulatory

871
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:00,399
distinction as opposed to a distinction

872
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:02,859
of the product itself we have in

873
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,170
Colorado we have an employee of adult

874
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:08,110
use because the same problems in both

875
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:10,690
market there's not anything that makes a

876
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:12,880
medical products medical company

877
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:16,110
formulation point of view it's just the

878
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,110
Challenger which household

879
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:24,909
we have time for our questionnaires

880
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:29,979
yes only that country's economic

881
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:32,679
question Billy whew fortunately I played

882
00:44:29,978 --> 00:44:36,098
and fortunately prior to have different

883
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:38,679
Android region Korea top deeper level in

884
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:40,649
a product market as opposed to more

885
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,499
common problems with that little

886
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:47,288
boutique that when a mood of a reunion

887
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:52,978
we cook using it capital or some other

888
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:52,979
product as that Android interview

889
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:10,799
vehicle top idli you can't so I'll sit

890
00:45:08,918 --> 00:45:14,168
I'll take the first leg of this question

891
00:45:10,798 --> 00:45:16,898
when I first start out and the three and

892
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:20,048
we will start make make a not comments

893
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:23,259
about old England is on the castle mine

894
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:25,838
got reaction was the typical grassroots

895
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:26,769
committee you know we're trying to get

896
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:27,998
away from the middle

897
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:31,028
why would somebody want to take a

898
00:45:27,998 --> 00:45:34,088
cannabis bill but you know as time

899
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:36,219
progresses you see the advantage I think

900
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:40,058
in the opportunity and matter of choice

901
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:43,119
I think both methods of obtaining your

902
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:47,289
medicine are going to be here to stay

903
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:50,280
I see a lot of people bringing castles

904
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:54,770
in cinder every's and I think that

905
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,769
goodnight I mean people being chosen so

906
00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:11,040
there's a certain percentage of people

907
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:13,440
that just will never you know I didn't

908
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,179
the other thing that I would say about I

909
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,360
agree with the choice and the other

910
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:19,679
thing is that different people pies

911
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,289
metabolize things differently and

912
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:24,929
there's different levels of bioavailable

913
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:26,940
ee depending on people how people create

914
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:29,190
their capsules navigate they're edible

915
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,250
and different people just try the

916
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,950
different things work well for them so

917
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:37,530
that implemented choices even just

918
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:40,730
beyond me do I want to trade or joint

919
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:43,590
want a castle to lose house entire body

920
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:46,409

921
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:48,900
want to make sure I plug again the dole

922
