1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,740
yeah we don't have anybody that's

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,359
advocating for us we have to do it

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,240
ourselves

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:15,919
I'm so proud I thought it was it was

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,420
crazy that your mom didn't know when you

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,980
were in the hospital your mom's like why

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,720
are you in the hospital that was slowly

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,760
it's funny to chop it up with your mom

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,229
on Facebook I'm so proud it was very

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,449
yeah cuz she's she's this she's so naive

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,969
you could its unfuck it's it's

12
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:34,820
ridiculous but she is an absolute super

13
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:36,609
genius she is a chainsaw mental chainsaw

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,070
like if you engage her in her world

15
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:42,320
she's frightening Lee bright frightening

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,149
and she's so earnest right yes

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
and she like X asked questions of like

18
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,450
like you people who come on yourself

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,550
they'll be like crazy and then she like

20
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,590
doo-doo-doo and they're like oh here's a

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,709
plate answer should you Kevin's mom you

22
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,940
said it too this is Kevin's mother and I

23
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,500
laugh if you put your bond they go why

24
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:00,109
do you let your mom and he'll like that

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,289
and I'm like because it allows them to

26
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:05,030
be able to enjoy your life and you need

27
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:08,689
to give it to me they they gave you life

28
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,459
and they gave a lot of their life to you

29
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:12,019
and I think that's the trade when you

30
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:14,390
get older is that you have to allow them

31
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:16,310
to enjoy your life too and so we make

32
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,319
deals where if it's personal stuff from

33
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,299
the past it shouldn't be set on line I

34
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,349
get her up you go into file with that

35
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,859
put that back

36
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:27,469
put that back put that back and then

37
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:29,109
anything else you want you good and it's

38
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,030
it's great you know it's great because

39
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:34,368
my mom is hysterical in person you'd be

40
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,909
like my god you look for real but

41
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:36,909
