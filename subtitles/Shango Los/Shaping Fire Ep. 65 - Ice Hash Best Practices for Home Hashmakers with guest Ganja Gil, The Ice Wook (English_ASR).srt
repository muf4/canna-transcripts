and smoking their own flower

some neighbors are working in small

groups with some neighbors growing while

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
others are turning the flower into

54
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,239
today my guest is ganja gill the ice

55
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,000
wook

56
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,920
i connected with gil after watching a

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,159
video of him giving best practices for

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
making regeneratively minded hash

59
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,159
at the dragonfly earth medicine hive

60
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,000
gathering earlier this year

61
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
gill is a lifelong cannabis cultivator

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
and hashmaker he's your hashmaker's

63
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,359
hashmaker

64
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,718
his hard to find hash and hash rosin are

65
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,239
sought after by heads throughout

66
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,239
california

67
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,239
gill is incredibly difficult to connect

68
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,319
with he lives way out in the forest and

69
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,000
doesn't often return to town

70
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,919
we eventually were able to connect via

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,959
satellite phone to record this episode

72
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,000
for you

73
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,598
today we're going to talk about

74
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
fine-tuning your ice water hash

75
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,639
production

76
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,959
some tricks of the trade and why making

77
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,799
quality hash is a love language

78
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,479
welcome to the show gill

79
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
thank you very much jango i really

80
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,719
really appreciate it thank you so much

81
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,639
awesome so let's get right into it you

82
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,159
know a lot of people the first thing

83
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,919
that they learn about when they when

84
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,598
they start trying to figure out how

85
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,439
they're gonna make ice hashes

86
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:41,919
at home is um about hash bags right

87
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,280
and you know hash bags have now been

88
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,039
around a long time

89
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
and of course there are the original

90
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,479
bubble bags um

91
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,920
and and now there's a whole bunch of

92
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,679
knockoffs and actually some of the

93
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,878
knockoffs are pretty damn good

94
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
too um i'm curious uh you know for

95
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,959
yourself

96
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,919
what do you look for when you are buying

97
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
a uh a hash bag you know i i know you

98
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,318
know

99
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,680
my first set was a you know bottom mesh

100
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,639
and i liked that but now i'm seeing

101
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
these new ones

102
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,238
that have got mesh on all sides and i

103
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,518
kind of covet those as well

104
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,519
so what are your thoughts

105
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,479
i'm just a frugal person by nature if

106
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,759
you know me

107
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:25,518
that's just how i am i try to garden um

108
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,840
as inexpensively as possible and

109
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
when it comes to extraction i kind of

110
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,120
think the same thing

111
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,959
um i don't try to cut corners per se

112
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,000
but i am often making this in a home

113
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,519
setting i'm not really in a lab like

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,318
situation so again

115
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,480
um not necessarily cutting corners but

116
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,238
i'm also not trying to spend tens of

117
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,359
thousands of dollars to accomplish

118
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
what i'm trying to do so having said

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,040
that

120
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,319
affordability is important to me

121
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,438
personally

122
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,958
simply because if you wash fresh frozen

123
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,759
material

124
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,878
you're gonna destroy bags um just the

125
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,000
way it goes

126
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,399
unfortunately um you can stay on top of

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,560
cleaning your bags

128
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,239
which i do um but eventually

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,319
the bags get ruined they don't last

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,679
forever you know if you're washing dried

131
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,199
material

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,439
they seem to last longer in my

133
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,919
experience but uh

134
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,000
you know uh typically they just don't

135
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,279
last forever so i see some bags out

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
there these days that

137
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,119
are getting more and more expensive and

138
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,840
personally they kind of

139
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,639
turn me off just to the extent that i

140
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,039
see them as disposable

141
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,160
having said that at the same time if

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,800
you're washing as much material as i am

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,439
it's very small expense the bags in the

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,199
grand scheme of things so

145
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,800
i'm kind of being vague i'm not giving a

146
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,639
real straight answer right now

147
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,319
but i personally do use bubble bags um

148
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,478
they've always worked for me i've been

149
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,478
using them almost 20 years now

150
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,800
they give me good results

151
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,199
they last long enough i can get them for

152
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,720
a very affordable price

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
i like them for that reason i've seen

154
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
now

155
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,800
marcus just dropped all side mesh walls

156
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
i

157
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,319
am interested in trying those i would

158
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,918
like to try those but uh

159
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,360
what were you gonna say buddy i was

160
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,560
gonna say when you're looking at

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,639
bags um are you looking primarily at the

162
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,720
like the quality of the stitching and

163
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
the material itself and whether or not

164
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
it's a bottom or a sidewall

165
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,439
or is there something else um you know

166
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,239
another variable that you look at in

167
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,240
addition to that

168
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
no that's very important you know the

169
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,879
stitching is probably mainly what it is

170
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
like to me

171
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,639
you can kind of get a good gauge on how

172
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
quality something's made by looking at

173
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,879
the actual stitching

174
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,639
um stitching is good materials that

175
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,159
they're made is good

176
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,519
if you want to get really really

177
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,360
technical you know you magnify

178
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,279
you look under a microscope at the

179
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,038
actual mesh

180
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,399
um i will say that that not all mesh is

181
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,000
created equal

182
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,839
people are using less professional mesh

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,199
than others and then some people are

184
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,198
using really professional mesh um

185
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,478
like companies that are using more

186
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,960
accurate micron

187
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,000
sizing sizing that is inaccurate so if

188
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,918
it's a 90

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,240
u bag then the spacing is is for 90 u

190
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,719
i have found sometimes looking at other

191
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,360
brands real close under the scope

192
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,919
it might not be what they're claiming it

193
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
to be

194
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:46,399
and that could be just from simple error

195
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:49,038
or just using more generic screen but

196
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,679
to me that is important you want to be

197
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,918
actually

198
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
capturing what you are intending to

199
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,719
capture for sure

200
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,960
so bags are important but like

201
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,000
i've made great cash with all bags

202
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,159
that's kind of where

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,918
i'm at is like i don't really want to

204
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
hop on the hype train there's a

205
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,359
particular brand of bags out there that

206
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,479
i'm not going to mention

207
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,319
that everyone promotes and personally me

208
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,519
i had a terrible customer service

209
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,400
experience with them

210
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,159
it really turned me off i will not use

211
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,519
that product anymore because

212
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,080
that's just what type of stubborn

213
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,879
[ __ ] i am you know so again

214
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,839
me personally i don't put much weight in

215
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,478
the bags

216
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,038
you know obviously there's a certain

217
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,719
level of quality that should be brought

218
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,038
but at the end of the day i've had

219
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,960
people send me these random bags from

220
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,279
random people

221
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,159
it's a bag you know what i mean like to

222
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,318
me

223
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,759
that's not gonna make it or break it for

224
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,160
you personally

225
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,840
again i stand by bubble man's product

226
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
there's definitely other ones out there

227
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,679
that are decent

228
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,360
i'd be scared of anything with a really

229
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,000
high ticket item

230
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,319
um but i'd also be scared to maybe use

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
something that was extremely um

232
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,560
inexpensive i think what's really

233
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,160
important first and foremost

234
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,399
is just clean the [ __ ] out of your bags

235
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,319
when you get them when you get your bags

236
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,079
clean them clean them clean them clean

237
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,479
them clean them

238
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,878
12 times if you have to because i've had

239
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,878
to before i've cleaned bags before

240
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,599
you go to do a wash and then you see

241
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,520
fibers and in your product and there's

242
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,120
nothing more disheartening

243
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,120
than to go months of growing as in

244
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,439
extracting the resin and then looking

245
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,280
down and realizing the bags that you

246
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,958
purchased have actually contaminated the

247
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,120
resin that you just harvested you know

248
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,559
to me that is just

249
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,278
the biggest kick in the nuts i've

250
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:43,838
experienced so again personally

251
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:46,799
you know not all bags are created equal

252
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
but uh don't trip out on what bags you

253
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,439
have available to you

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,919
you know just make sure they're nice and

255
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,200
clean seem solid

256
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,519
and that's really what's all that's

257
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,839
important to me personally i do like

258
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
this

259
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
the mesh side walls the all mesh as

260
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,559
someone who works by themselves

261
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,479
that's something i kind of just started

262
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,399
playing with this past year

263
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
i'm excited to see that bubble man came

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,278
out with some

265
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,959
they save your back you know if you're

266
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,320
pulling large

267
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:16,479
washes by yourself all day every day

268
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
those all mesh ones are definitely

269
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,159
really nice in my opinion there's

270
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,079
something to be said for them for sure

271
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,838
so you know there are there are

272
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
different sizes of sets

273
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
and everybody kind of has their own

274
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
thoughts on what their favorite bags

275
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
you know favorite you know micron bags

276
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
are to use

277
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,439
and uh you know i i uh you know my first

278
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,439
set was a nine set

279
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
and there were several of the bags that

280
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
i just never freaking used and now you

281
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
get people who are selling

282
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,399
you know you know three four five bag

283
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
sets

284
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,639
um and you know they cost a little bit

285
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,000
less so you're not paying money for bags

286
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,879
that you're not using

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
um what are your thoughts as far as how

288
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,439
many bags

289
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,278
are are you know the best to buy do you

290
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,720
use all nine of yours or you're like you

291
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,278
know in the end we're probably only

292
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,839
gonna use

293
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,838
four so a four set will be the way to go

294
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,560
it's a really good question um to me it

295
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,920
just depends what your goals are what

296
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,958
you're trying to do

297
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,679
um me personally i make a lot of hash

298
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,879
rosin

299
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:24,399
but i also make a lot of just hash melt

300
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:27,759
to me they are two different things so i

301
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,679
wash for them differently um

302
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,278
if you're watching for more of a full

303
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:36,239
spectrum hash rosin type situation

304
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,879
less bags is the way um if you're

305
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,399
looking

306
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:43,919
for more of a melt situation to me

307
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,360
is use all the bags you possibly can

308
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,360
and sometimes you don't know what you're

309
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,039
trying to make you know that the the

310
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,800
strain or the cultivar you're using

311
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,599
dictates what you're gonna make you know

312
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,958
so

313
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
if you're gonna wash something for the

314
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,518
first time sometimes i tell people do a

315
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
test wash and use all your bags

316
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,120
use all your bags that will give you a

317
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,278
lot of information

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,278
it'll show you where it dumped and where

319
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,879
it didn't dump and then it might let you

320
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,679
know you know what

321
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,159
there wasn't really all that much 73

322
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,879
anyways in there so we could negate that

323
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,319
bag and throw it into the 90 if we

324
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,000
wanted to and again that's just

325
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,720
hypothetical situation that i'm

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,958
describing

327
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
i would probably very rarely put the 73

328
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,958
in the 90 but

329
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,959
again uh there's just situations that

330
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,239
you wouldn't really know until you wash

331
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,319
and then you know

332
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,079
what the size of the heads are and where

333
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,240
it's spinning and whatnot

334
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,359
but uh more bags for melt less bags for

335
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,399
rosin

336
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,039
i never use a 25 u-bag

337
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,200
to me that just slows down the uh the

338
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,759
draining and i've never grabbed anything

339
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,720
from a 25 micron bag that i felt like

340
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,480
was worth

341
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,480
you know keeping personally so uh

342
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,039
you know if i'm gonna do a full spectrum

343
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,320
hash wash i'll typically you know

344
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:04,319
washington 220 i keep the 190

345
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,519
the 160 the 90

346
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,480
and the 45. it's pretty much

347
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,320
those four bags that i'm filtering

348
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,399
through for the full spectrum raw

349
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,399
uh ash rosin and when it comes to the

350
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
melt like i said i'm gonna use all eight

351
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,600
of those bags

352
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,159
right on so um do you really think that

353
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,040
they're

354
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,838
like as far as like making connoisseur

355
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,879
grade

356
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,600
versus regular toker grade um

357
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,439
outside of you know the little uh the

358
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,399
little pieces of material that might get

359
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,160
in your finished

360
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,679
product which of course sucks and as

361
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,719
you've already referred to

362
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:44,479
you know in cp i would think that um

363
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,399
mediocre bags plus good technique

364
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,519
could make killer hash the same way that

365
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,559
great bags

366
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,360
and crappy technique could equal poor

367
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,319
hash

368
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,800
and so i generally encourage people to

369
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,639
buy the bags that fit their budget

370
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,439
but go heavy on care preparation and

371
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,039
technique

372
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,839
does that do you you know does that make

373
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,838
sense to you

374
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,000
that totally makes sense to me and that

375
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,759
is where i

376
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,480
am at with mechanical extraction um

377
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,240
growing cannabis and extracting it

378
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
inflates egos it's just

379
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
something that i've come across in my

380
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,480
life it's how it goes

381
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,160
i don't know what it is about the nature

382
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,278
of growing cannabis but it does that

383
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,799
and i'm just here to say i really really

384
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,799
try to portray

385
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:41,838
that i have no ego when it comes to this

386
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,719
it is always the ganja doing the

387
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
performance

388
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,959
it is always the ganja that is

389
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,639
turning heads impressing people

390
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,319
mechanical extraction

391
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:58,000
is simply not that hard

392
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,879
anyone can do it it's like cooking is

393
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
what i like to

394
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,958
describe it to people some people are

395
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,159
better at cooking than others that's

396
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,679
just the way it is

397
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,360
to me the people that are better at

398
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,319
cooking are just better at following

399
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
directions

400
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,600
and then they might even have a little

401
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,480
bit of passion about it as well to add

402
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,040
to it

403
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,639
um anyone can mechanically extract

404
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,039
if you have passion about it you're

405
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,959
going to pursue it with more passion and

406
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,159
more focus and more drive and yeah

407
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,439
you'll probably be better at someone

408
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,799
who's being forced to do it for an

409
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
hourly wage job which

410
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,679
doesn't make sense to me but it's

411
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,198
probably going on somewhere in the world

412
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:33,359
but uh

413
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,639
the end of the day it's not that hard to

414
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,278
mechanically extract

415
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,198
anyone can do it what it comes down to

416
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,838
is the material the material the

417
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,159
material

418
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,279
if you're extracting great material it's

419
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,838
going to be easy

420
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:48,000
if you've got some mediocre stuff it's

421
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,920
just always going to be mediocre so

422
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,679
yes you can extract make amazing hash

423
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:59,759
with decent bags and great cannabis with

424
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:02,239
decent cannabis and great bags good luck

425
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,278
so um actually the first time that i

426
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,759
came across you

427
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,679
i was actually watching a video and you

428
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,360
were talking about the choosing a

429
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,519
material and that's when i first got

430
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,240
turned on i'm like oh this guy really

431
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,720
approaches making ice hash in the way

432
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,560
that

433
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
in a way that i value you were talking

434
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,679
about how

435
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,039
um you know you were talking about some

436
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,599
of the attributes that you

437
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,958
you look for when choosing hash but then

438
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
you also said

439
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,638
as you've kind of referred to earlier

440
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,679
already that that

441
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,919
the ganja will tell you you know what

442
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,439
application will be best for it and what

443
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,799
bags to use so

444
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,639
so i'm going to kind of give you this

445
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,240
like you know broad question

446
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
and so that you can kind of take us

447
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,159
through your thought process

448
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,559
how do you choose material and when

449
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,759
you're when you're examining material

450
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,919
to potentially wash what are you looking

451
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,919
for

452
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,959
so that's a good question um i'm in a

453
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:00,479
different situation with people

454
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,799
then to be honest currently i am only

455
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,680
focused and for years now i've only been

456
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,000
focused on

457
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,359
processing my own material that i grow

458
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,480
myself so

459
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,440
it's kind of easier answer than could be

460
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,920
where it's like i freeze everything i

461
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
grow

462
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,319
and i wash everything i grow so it's not

463
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,039
really

464
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,000
um a debate of hey am i going to wash

465
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,879
this or not if

466
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,759
i'm growing it i'm washing it um and

467
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,198
again

468
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,278
i am only washing my own material uh so

469
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,198
i'm not really going to other farms and

470
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,120
looking and seeing like oh is this

471
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,039
potentially something i should wash

472
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
that's not really necessarily going on

473
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,919
because that's not what i'm doing with

474
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,600
my time

475
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,439
but i do just in theory walk a lot of

476
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,800
farms and wonder hey would this wash

477
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,160
with that wash

478
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:53,120
and to me it comes down to

479
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,278
two things it's the texture of the resin

480
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,039
and the structure of the flower

481
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,120
that's what i'm looking for first and

482
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,000
foremost you know if i can touch that

483
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,039
resin

484
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,480
and i can see heads on my hand you know

485
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,599
it's that dry

486
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,720
eye um resin that you can literally just

487
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,279
touch a flower

488
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,038
move your hand and you will see heads on

489
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,359
your fingertips you know uh

490
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,838
it's not that super sticky resin that

491
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,719
like just so sticky that it just leaves

492
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,720
like i said just

493
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,000
a smear on your hand in there you won't

494
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,600
see the heads

495
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,960
um and then also a

496
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,599
a structure of flour that exposes a lot

497
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,279
of surface area is how i describe it

498
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:38,639
not necessarily really large dense

499
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:42,079
spheres but stuff that actually

500
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,200
exposes the surface area um

501
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,759
you know allowing the material to to

502
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
come off

503
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,759
basically you know making it where it

504
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
gives it up

505
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,919
when i prep the material that's another

506
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,678
big part of the process as well is

507
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,520
you really want to break the stuff down

508
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,600
as much as you possibly can

509
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,279
you know certain structure of flower

510
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,678
allows you to break it down

511
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,759
naturally to very small and then other

512
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,679
structure of flower it's really big

513
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,519
and it just doesn't lend itself to being

514
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,679
broken all the way down

515
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,000
um but those are the two things that i

516
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,400
look for first and foremost is

517
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
basically the the texture of the resin

518
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,160
and the structure of the flower

519
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,200
and then obviously i'm i'm forgetting

520
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,919
just the smell

521
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
the overall aroma and smell you know of

522
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,640
something isn't

523
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,080
appealing to me uh the smell i don't

524
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,600
really care about washing it you know

525
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,038
what i mean even if it's the greatest

526
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,959
resin in the world

527
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,879
many years ago we all used to wash a

528
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,919
bunch of ogre and it was like oh it

529
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,080
dumped ogre

530
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,200
it was just so much resin it was white

531
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,038
it was great

532
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,279
just didn't really have much of a smell

533
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,879
or anything to now we've all forgotten

534
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,399
about it at this point you know it's

535
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,720
kind of got to be

536
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,679
terpe first and foremost especially in

537
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,000
2020

538
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,200
you got to come with something really

539
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,880
loud and

540
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
something to get your attention these

541
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
days

542
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,519
right on so those are those are good i

543
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,600
um

544
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,879
suggestions for you know if we're

545
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,678
shopping around for

546
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,600
a flower that we're gonna run or for

547
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,759
confirming the flower that we already

548
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,558
have that we want to run it

549
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,879
i do like this idea though which um you

550
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:16,960
know

551
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,160
i had not come across before i talked to

552
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,720
you about somebody who

553
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,600
who exclusively grows their own stuff

554
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,440
and then washes their own stuff

555
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,119
for for people who are listening who

556
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,279
like that idea

557
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:34,639
um you know when you are choosing

558
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,918
the uh the the flower that you're gonna

559
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,360
grow for a season you know if you're

560
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,960
gonna run a bunch of it that's

561
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,119
that's a lot of commitment to grow a lot

562
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,160
of that one plant so

563
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:47,519
do you for example run a couple

564
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,080
trial plants you know summer one

565
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,000
and then if you like it you you know you

566
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,240
start earlier in the season and may and

567
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,279
and start those plants again and clone

568
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,640
them and put them

569
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,200
into your grow so that you have it in

570
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,520
volume

571
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,519
the next year um i guess that's kind of

572
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,240
a way for me to back into how do you

573
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,839
choose

574
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,640
what cultivars you're going to run

575
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,359
um since i know that you're an uh

576
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
primarily an

577
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,599
outdoor guy i kind of think that

578
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,079
generally you need to

579
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,399
test it one summer and then go big with

580
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,439
it the following summer unless you've

581
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,440
got a different technique

582
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,919
no that's uh that's smart that's uh that

583
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,519
would be a very

584
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,000
well calculated way to do it um

585
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,918
i am blessed enough to live in you know

586
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,679
the cannabis hub of the world in my

587
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,200
opinion which is humboldt county

588
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,320
and i'm surrounded by ganja people who

589
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,600
you know all we do is talk speak eat

590
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:50,399
sleep ganja and fortunately through that

591
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,798
there is just certain cultivars out

592
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,080
there

593
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:57,440
that we know perform and hash

594
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,158
mechanical extraction um over the years

595
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
there's

596
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,159
just kind of been tried and true ones

597
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,759
that we all know work

598
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,600
fortunately people have then begun

599
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,960
breeding with those same tried and true

600
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,959
strains so

601
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,120
you know there's certain genetics that

602
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,480
you begin to be familiar with

603
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:17,119
and then you know that they perform um

604
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,440
a lot of clone only strains are floating

605
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,439
around humboldt county that

606
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,519
we've all determined you know these ones

607
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,600
washed these ones don't wash

608
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,000
um so fortunately i'm in that position

609
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,399
where i have access to solid genetics

610
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,640
that

611
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,759
you know myself and others have tried

612
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,038
over the years and we

613
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:38,079
know they perform um now

614
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,000
having said that over the years

615
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,000
i have been growing a lot of these what

616
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,359
i call them now classics you know

617
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,159
classic

618
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,558
mechanical extraction strains uh classic

619
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
uh

620
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,038
you know solventless strains like you

621
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,759
know garlic cookies gmo we all know a

622
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,038
dumps

623
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,519
strawberry banana we all know a dumps

624
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,079
key lime pie it works great you know

625
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,918
there's

626
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,918
cookies and cream you know there's all

627
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,120
these different things out there gorilla

628
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,360
glue

629
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,798
sour diesel you know we can just keep

630
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,479
naming them wedding cake

631
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,918
all the cakes you know so there's

632
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,519
different things that we

633
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,520
know for a fact wash um

634
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,038
so it's really easy to plant those and

635
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,200
just know um

636
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,200
i will say learn from my mistakes and

637
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
don't put all your eggs in one basket

638
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,200
you know

639
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:30,319
don't grow one varietal grow multiple

640
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,000
you know grow you know as many as you

641
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,918
can within reason you know that can

642
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,640
become a problem too just having too

643
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,759
many things that becomes a burden so

644
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,360
you know i think diversity is definitely

645
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,558
a good approach um definitely running

646
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,359
some tried and true

647
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,279
things is always wise as far as a

648
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,479
business goes

649
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:56,240
but i'm not going to pretend that

650
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,720
i don't chase um terps

651
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,159
and there is something extremely

652
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,558
exciting

653
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,440
about growing strains that you don't

654
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,279
know

655
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
that they're gonna wash maybe you got it

656
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,158
from a breeder you know there's a lot of

657
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,200
breeders these days

658
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,400
we're breeding for hash you know

659
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,519
awning noodles hairy palms exotic

660
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
genetic mics

661
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,879
you know they're all these different

662
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,360
guys uh that are out there that are

663
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,960
breeding strictly for hash so

664
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,719
to me there's these sure bets where you

665
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,400
can get the clones that you know wash

666
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,880
you can try to get the seeds from the

667
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,120
guy who's breeding for hash

668
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,280
but like i'm not going to lie like right

669
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,599
now my second round is

670
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,200
all seeds they're all seeds all

671
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,240
different phenos

672
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,240
um yeah i'm doing it with the intention

673
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,480
that hopefully it all washes

674
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,038
but i don't know you know they're

675
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,038
definitely hashy crosses

676
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,079
so some of them are gonna come but some

677
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,798
of them are not

678
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,759
and that's kind of just the life of a

679
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,839
hashmaker

680
00:23:53,759 --> 00:24:00,879
you know as a hashmaker i have eaten it

681
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,759
many times thrown thousands of dollars

682
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,559
in barrels

683
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,919
to get nothing you know that's just kind

684
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,798
of uh

685
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,440
the nature of being a hashmaker there is

686
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,480
definitely

687
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,880
some faith involved and to me you have

688
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
to be

689
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:20,000
in it for reasons that you know

690
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,079
you have some questions that you want

691
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,599
answered or you have some things that

692
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,720
you want to discover yourself

693
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,240
potentially

694
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,480
and that's why you're doing it you're

695
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,880
doing the research through washing it

696
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,480
and it's not all home runs it's not all

697
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,520
grand slams

698
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,000
it's very much ups and downs and that's

699
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,000
just

700
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,359
the way it goes i was talking to a guy

701
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,919
at the um at an after party after

702
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,038
emerald cup and i actually don't know

703
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,320
his name but um

704
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,038
he said to me he says the worst hash he

705
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,759
makes

706
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,359
is hash that he's making for money and

707
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,000
the best hash that he

708
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,158
makes is stuff that he's making because

709
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,319
he's passionate about the cultivar

710
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,880
or he's making it for he and his friends

711
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,879
to smoke

712
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,880
yeah no that makes total sense to me

713
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,000
personally you know it's all about

714
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,559
intention in life

715
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
it really is tell a lot of people you

716
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,319
know cannabis

717
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,440
yeah can make money you know totally

718
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,519
this industry

719
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,880
is profitable i'm not gonna try to act

720
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,240
like it's not

721
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,600
but the people that flock here strictly

722
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,720
for profits

723
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,119
strictly for money i tell them all

724
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,038
all the time like there's so much easier

725
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,759
ways in this life to make money

726
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,400
if you really your sole focus is to make

727
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,558
money

728
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,320
don't get involved in cannabis there's

729
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,639
easier ways to get money

730
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,639
money comes and money goes um cannabis

731
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
yeah you can get rich growing it but the

732
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,799
people who come here

733
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
solely for the money they fail they

734
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,319
leave

735
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,200
you know they they spend lots of money

736
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:00,480
and uh

737
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:02,720
have these like you know crazy ideas

738
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,839
but it doesn't seem to pan out to those

739
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,960
people in my opinion you know it's like

740
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:11,839
to me you know passion and cannabis

741
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,400
are intertwined you know it's this thing

742
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,639
where

743
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,120
i pursue it because that's what i choose

744
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,600
to do you know the money is like a

745
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,959
a secondary thing that just comes along

746
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,119
with it to be honest you know but

747
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,319
what keeps me interested in cannabis is

748
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,038
cannabis you know it's

749
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,319
it's the biggest rabbit hole that ever

750
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,240
existed in my opinion

751
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,918
and you know uh we can go down any road

752
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,640
talk about anything you know you want to

753
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,759
talk about soil nutrients you know

754
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,559
environment

755
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:44,319
strains you know like extraction is just

756
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,599
another one and that's just a small

757
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,599
piece of it there's so many

758
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,959
other facets of extraction that we can

759
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,798
talk about you know so

760
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,120
uh you know extraction is just one way

761
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,038
to uh

762
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,239
to look into cannabis you know to look

763
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,079
at it more closely

764
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,000
to learn more about it it's just a way

765
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,678
to focus your intent is how i see it you

766
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,759
know like

767
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,200
as a cannabis grower what are you trying

768
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,879
to do what are you trying to say you

769
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
know there's so many different avenues

770
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,200
that you could be

771
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,959
taking you know are you trying to

772
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,679
produce for flower are you trying to

773
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,278
grow the most

774
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,960
are you trying to grow just a little bit

775
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,599
like what are your intentions you know

776
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,159
me personally once i started focusing

777
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,558
towards hash it just all made sense to

778
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,960
me

779
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,798
everything clicked it was like oh this

780
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,399
is it this is why i'm growing is for

781
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:29,918
this

782
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,158
they're different things in my opinion

783
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,000
growing for extraction and growing for

784
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,000
flower production you know they kind of

785
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,398
lead different lives

786
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,319
yeah that's a i can see how that is also

787
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,319
like the perspective of a true

788
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,000
you know passionate artisan right when

789
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,879
you're doing it for your heart

790
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,240
as as as well as surviving and i

791
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,640
personally think it's really great you

792
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,679
know

793
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,440
as as really premium hash

794
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,640
rosins and uh and even melt

795
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,000
become increasingly popular in the scene

796
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,520
it's nice to see high quality product

797
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,079
fetching good prices from a lot of

798
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,240
people

799
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,918
now um you know that there's always been

800
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,798
a hash market but this

801
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,520
you know the the the market for elite

802
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,759
hash

803
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,359
and really good hash rosin is certainly

804
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,519
exploding right now and

805
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,879
is becoming this you know increasingly

806
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,359
large part

807
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,760
of our scene the last question i want to

808
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,639
ask you about the choosing of material

809
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,919
is uh

810
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,080
do you have any uh insight on uh washing

811
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,640
indoor material versus washing outdoor

812
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,639
material

813
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,119
i'll talk to you about that we could

814
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,879
talk about that all day if you wanted to

815
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,879
shackle we could just go back and forth

816
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,079
now that is a that is a interesting

817
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,918
subject to me personally because yes for

818
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:51,678
the past uh

819
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,000
i think it's seven years now i've been

820
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,919
cultivating solely outdoors you know i

821
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,960
hung up the indoor towel i've only been

822
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,799
outdoors for

823
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,480
seven years you know running some

824
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,240
nursery inside here and there

825
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,480
some moms and stuff like that but i

826
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,880
haven't really flowered indoors in years

827
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,159
now

828
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,320
um and there's definitely this

829
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,520
you know thing going around i feel like

830
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,798
in the community

831
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:18,158
where people are convinced

832
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:21,278
indoor flower is superior than outdoor

833
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,840
flower and therefore

834
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,119
indoor grown resin is superior than

835
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,798
outdoor grown resin

836
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,479
um me personally i do not

837
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,440
believe that could be further from the

838
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,440
truth um

839
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,398
indoor will always you know

840
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:43,359
require a higher ticket because

841
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,038
it has a higher overhead and i am not

842
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,759
going to argue with that you know if

843
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,919
something costs more to produce inside

844
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,038
okay cool you know get more for it you

845
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,480
know

846
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:57,200
can you grow more aesthetically um

847
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,640
pleasing pretty flowers indoors yeah

848
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,640
you're in a sealed room

849
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,960
you know it's literally sealed you're

850
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,240
not in an outdoor environment

851
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,480
with fluctuating light patterns you know

852
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,519
different weather you know

853
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,159
not to mention insects wind and all of

854
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,519
the above

855
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,679
you know what i mean there is some

856
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,158
things going on outdoors that you just

857
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,840
can't

858
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,960
control you know and yes

859
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,079
we are trying to make clean resin that

860
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,759
is the goal

861
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:30,879
of a hashmaker is to make very clean

862
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,038
resin that is simply just resin

863
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,000
so obviously that is easier to do

864
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,240
indoors

865
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,240
you're in a sealed environment obviously

866
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,558
it's easier to keep contaminant

867
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,599
out of indoor grown resin it's just a

868
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,519
fact

869
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,439
so you know a lot of people i know who i

870
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,119
see extracting indoors

871
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,120
i'm like you should be doing melt all

872
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,359
you should do is make melt because

873
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,599
it's so easy to make clean melt in an

874
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:55,199
indoor situation it's not grown outside

875
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,199
with the dust flying around and

876
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,399
everything else you know so

877
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,798
indoor it's very easy in my opinion

878
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:09,678
to create clean resin for sure

879
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:13,519
however the sun produces terpene levels

880
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,798
and compounds and flavors and things

881
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,798
that no lamb could ever do i just don't

882
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,798
believe it so

883
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:26,398
i see these terp results and these um

884
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:29,440
even just uh potency tests from same

885
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:32,719
cultivars grown outside versus inside

886
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,240
and the terp levels are quadrupled

887
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,600
to me you can't argue with data

888
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,120
i have very rarely seen like terp levels

889
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,918
that have rivaled

890
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,879
outdoor ones in my experience do they

891
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,000
exist i'm sure

892
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,519
you know but to me

893
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,599
it's easier to grow more

894
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,960
complex uh terpene profiles

895
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:00,959
outdoors in the great outdoors

896
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,120
and i also will just always stand by the

897
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,720
fact that

898
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,719
there's all these things that come into

899
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,600
play when you're growing outdoors

900
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,679
you know like to me things that i like

901
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,158
to think about you know that to me

902
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,480
are kind of like these romantic ideals

903
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,840
about cannabis growing you know like

904
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,919
i like the idea that cannabis grown in

905
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,599
southern california is different than

906
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,640
northern california and

907
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:30,000
the stuff in washington is different and

908
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:34,159
i like to see how humidity and elevation

909
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,200
and you know terroir and all that

910
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:40,799
plays a role in the production of

911
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,159
cannabis you know indoor growing

912
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,599
is really cool i got awesome homies who

913
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,399
have dedicated their life to it

914
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,158
and they're doing amazing things shout

915
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,278
out to my homies in rhode island

916
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,760
liberty llc they're doing amazing things

917
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,880
with

918
00:32:53,759 --> 00:33:00,398
living soil inside steve cantwell

919
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,080
in vegas green life productions blows my

920
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:03,839
mind every time i see it i had the

921
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,480
luxury of walking here last summer it

922
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,158
was

923
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,519
one of the greatest indoor facilities

924
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,440
i've ever seen so

925
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,519
i'm not trying to take away from what

926
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,320
people are doing indoors many states

927
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,399
don't allow

928
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,079
outdoor cultivation so you can only do

929
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,639
what you can do

930
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,918
but uh at the end of the day for me

931
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,278
personally

932
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,320
i much rather enjoy working with

933
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:29,038
outdoor resin typically people grow

934
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:32,398
larger plants outside

935
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:35,679
it's all just uh proportional

936
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:38,879
larger plants mean larger trichome heads

937
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,840
larger yields um

938
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,679
i enjoy working with the resin outdoors

939
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,678
a lot of times

940
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,080
it's more able to be captured

941
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,440
i find a lot of times the stuff indoors

942
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,839
is very greasy

943
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,440
very very hard to capture um

944
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,639
and there's there's great qualities

945
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,320
about that you know there's nothing

946
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,320
wrong with greasy

947
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,599
resin besides the fact that it's hard to

948
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,359
capture you know so

949
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:09,039
uh there there's great things all around

950
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,878
you know you can grow great resin

951
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,599
indoors and you can grow great resin

952
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,719
outdoors

953
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,760
um i obviously am biased because what

954
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,480
i'm focused on

955
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,000
is growing outside and it's because i

956
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,039
live in a great region for

957
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,599
growing cannabis outdoors um if i wasn't

958
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,878
i would obviously be growing it indoors

959
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,359
um

960
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:29,918
doesn't bother me that indoor commands a

961
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,960
higher

962
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:36,638
premium but the whole

963
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,720
rhetoric of indoor

964
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,760
rosin is better because it was grown

965
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,598
indoor

966
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,440
i just think that's [ __ ] you know

967
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,879
like i've seen a lot of indoor stuff

968
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,918
that like

969
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,799
wasn't really turned in my head well

970
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,000
that is

971
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,800
probably the most elegant and insightful

972
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,320
uh comparison of indoor and outdoor that

973
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,560
i have ever heard

974
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,320
um that was beautifully put together and

975
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,559
that's probably informed a lot of folks

976
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,838
and

977
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,159
it's nice too to hear uh a kind of a

978
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,960
summation of the pros and cons

979
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:09,920
which kind of like le satisfies both the

980
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,320
indoor people

981
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,280
and satisfies the outdoor people since

982
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,960
you spoke to

983
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,599
like the clear advantages of both so

984
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,119
that's great um let's go ahead and take

985
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,960
our first short break

986
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,039
we'll be right back you are listening to

987
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,760
shaping fire and my guest today

988
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:29,519
is hashmaker ganja gill the ice book

989
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,119
for many transitioning to organic

990
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,719
gardening can be overwhelming

991
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,880
there's so much to learn about soil

992
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,879
biology and fermentation

993
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,920
bioflux fermented plant boost from

994
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,838

996
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,000
start growing organically today

997
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,680
invented by a california farmer growing

998
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,920
organic for 40 years

999
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,719

for those who want a natural micro

1002
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,358
booster without having to brew their own

improves root development accelerates

1006
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,599
the conversion of organic matter into

1007
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,760
humus

1008
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,240
increases nutrient use efficiency and

1009

activity

1011
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,400
in addition to the bioflux fermented

1012
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,039
plant booster

1013
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,160
everflux also makes an activated biochar

1014
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,400
called terraflux

1015
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,358
that is infused with the bioflex plant

1016
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,358
booster

1017
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,039
imagine combining the buffering and

1018
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:21,920
rhizosphere enhancing qualities of

1019
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,679
biochar

1020
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,440
infused with a range of earthworm

1021

castings insect frass

1022

1023
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,119
ingredients

1024
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,000
i'm using terraflux infused biochar this

1025
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,358
summer myself

1026
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,960
and it smells alive rich and potent

1027
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,559
these products have been scientifically

1028
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,400
proven to match yields and increase

1029
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,679
flower quality and pest resistance

1030
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,760
when compared to traditional npk inputs

if you are looking for reliable organic

1032

fertilizers that will free you up to

1033

focus on other aspects of your garden

1034

everflux

1041
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,960
for years organic cultivators have been

1042
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,680
looking for a replacement for using peat

1043
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,760
moss

1044
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,279
peat moss has long been the go-to soil

1045
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
amendment for water retention and

1046
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,400
container growing

1047
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,160
but organic growers know that peat moss

1048
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,079
is an unsustainable resource

1049
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,639
and the mining of peat bogs destroys

1050
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,480
habitat and releases sequestered carbon

1051
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,078
but peat moss works so well that many

1052
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,000
have continued to use it

1053
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,839
but now there's finally a revolutionary

1054
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,800
replacement for peat moss that shares

1055
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,838
the same benefits

1056
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,160
while also being sustainable pit moss

1057
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,000
sounds and axe like peat moss but

1058
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,000
instead of being mined from fragile

1059
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,480
ecosystems it actually is made from

1060
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,559
upcycled organic paper and tree bark

1061
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,079
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

1062
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,880
in your substrate and creating air

1063
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,359
pockets and

1064
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,160
tiny living environments for microbes

1065
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,639
pit moss

1066
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,358
instantly increases aeration nutrient

1067
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,078
absorption

1068
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,119
and water conservation too carefully and

1069
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,039
locally sourced

1070
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,358
pit moss is the result of decades-long

1071
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,480
research into the use of recycled paper

1072
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,799
fibers

1073
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,199
pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat

1074
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,079
moss and handles exactly the same

1075
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,000
and like peat moss pit moss is inert so

1076
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,839
it won't change your ph

1077
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
available in a range of preparations

1078

best traits that a line has to offer

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,680
this kind of breeding takes time

1100
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,079
talent and space to work no matter what

1120
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,358
much like a fern that some folks can't

even identify it as cannabis

1122

shaping fire i'm your host shango los

1146
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,519
and our guest this week is hashmaker

1147
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,199
ganja gill the ice wook so during the

1148
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,000
first set we were talking a lot about

1149
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,480
you know

1150
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,079
the the types of bags and the materials

1151
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,199
that you needed just to kind of like get

1152
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,480
us started

1153
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,039
but during this second set we're going

1154
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,920
to talk a lot more about the actual

1155
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,559
process of of manufacturing and

1156
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,358
mechanically separating the heads

1157
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,279
so um so gil let's start with

1158
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,519
temperature of the location

1159
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,560
and you know a lot of people you know

1160
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,838
have got these

1161
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,759
very um very expensive locations

1162
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,519
with with like you know a gazillion

1163
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,760
watts of air conditioning

1164
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,239
and i really like visiting those places

1165
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,480
and a lot of really high quality hash

1166
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:25,199
comes out of those locations

1167
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,400
at the same time i know that i've hung

1168
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,598
out with my friends

1169
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,680
and we have washed on a

1170
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:36,400
on a deck you know on a on a summer day

1171
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,719
where the where our washing machine is

1172
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,200
like

1173
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,759
in the shade but we're in the sun and

1174
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,358
we're

1175
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,119
we're having as much social time and

1176
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:43,679
enjoying ourselves as we are making the

1177
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,400
hash

1178
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,118
and we've also made good hash not in a

1179
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,720
freezing

1180
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:54,400
environment and so my question for you

1181
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,559
is is how uh how important do you

1182
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,440
see the temperature of the location

1183
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,078
being

1184
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,519
and and where on that range do you think

1185
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,640
that we want to be

1186
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,400
both for the the the home

1187
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,239
hash maker who's making something for

1188
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,480
their head and also

1189
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:14,318
somebody who is planning on on sharing

1190
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,318
with their friends maybe even at a price

1191
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,079
that's a great question um you know

1192
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,119
there's lots of variables in my opinion

1193
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,920
um the first and foremost is what are

1194
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,000
you washing

1195
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,800
you know what what kind of material are

1196
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,119
you washing um

1197
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,880
decent you know to me if you're gonna

1198
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,400
wash fresh frozen

1199
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,760
you need a cold room um that's not

1200
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,800
every single situation certain strains

1201
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,520
have a more

1202
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,240
drier resin like gmo or strawberry

1203
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,159
banana

1204
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,598
you might get away with doing that in a

1205
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,559
not cold room

1206
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,079
but if you're gonna wash freshly frozen

1207
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,559
cannabis

1208
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,200
to me you're gonna have a lot easier

1209
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,880
time

1210
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:01,519
in a cold room and by a cold room

1211
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,160
i mean under 50 degrees if you can keep

1212
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,079
it under

1213
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,078
50 it's going to be better the colder

1214
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,680
the better if you could keep it

1215
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:12,000
mid 35s that's ideal um

1216
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,440
i understand that's not really possible

1217
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,960
for everybody

1218
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,519
such as myself i live in trinity county

1219
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,960
um it's mid july i just harvested some

1220
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,920
light depth

1221
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,760
it's 100 degrees during the day my

1222
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,559
little cold room

1223
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,920
cannot keep up with the ambient

1224
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,559
temperature outside

1225
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,280
so it's part of the reason i you know

1226
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,759
work and live

1227
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,000
seasonally where i am just cultivating

1228
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,839
all summer long and i wait for the

1229
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,079
colder weather to come in november

1230
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:44,639
before i start processing stuff

1231
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,640
that's what works for me i just have a

1232
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,000
small room that i wash and it's like a

1233
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,400
8x10 room

1234
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
with just a typical window unit in there

1235
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,680
you know buy the biggest window

1236
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,159
unit you can afford and i just have a

1237
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,879
little cool bot on it it's like a 300

1238
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,719
controller that basically just tricks

1239
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,039
the air conditioner into

1240
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,759
not freezing and it just keeps it

1241
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,920
running and cycling below 60 so it'll

1242
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,319
get your room cold you know they're used

1243
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,639
in all different types of applications

1244
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:14,639
cut flower industry hunters use them

1245
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:17,759
blah blah blah they're out there

1246
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,719
um you can definitely also get cold

1247
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,920
rooms

1248
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,439
um that are affordable you know 3 500

1249
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,960
bucks or so for a walk-in that you can

1250
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,079
just drop on top of a slab

1251
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,800
to me that's affordable um obviously

1252
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,960
it's not for some home hash maker

1253
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,280
um but i would still encourage you to

1254
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,880
try to use a cold space

1255
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,960
whether it be your basement your porch

1256
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,119
or you wash in the middle of the night

1257
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,119
i've done that many times where you know

1258
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,039
sleep during the day wash in the middle

1259
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,079
of the night it's not that crazy to

1260
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,920
someone like me

1261
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:55,440
um but to me if you are washing

1262
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,119
freshly frozen material you're gonna be

1263
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,599
frustrated doing it

1264
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,039
in something that isn't cold um you're

1265
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,079
gonna coat your bags

1266
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:06,719
you're gonna hurt your yields

1267
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,640
you know even really greasy material in

1268
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,239
a cold room can be challenging you know

1269
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,078
a lot of times the wedding

1270
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:13,838
cakes and the ice cream cakes and the

1271
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,160
stuff that i wash the stuff's just so

1272
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:17,279
greasy by nature that even in a 40

1273
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,879
degree room

1274
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,519
it's hard you know the difference

1275
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,559
between a 45 degree room and a 40 degree

1276
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,599
room is a difference

1277
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,078
and then one that's 35 it's different

1278
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,440
you know

1279
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:32,079
like uh it helps so having

1280
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,720
everything be cold cold cold your bag's

1281
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,280
cold the water cold your tools cold

1282
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:39,679
everything cold it does help with

1283
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,160
washing fresh frozen for sure

1284
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:42,799
if you're gonna wash dried material or

1285
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,759
flash

1286
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,160
dried material it's not as important in

1287
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,000
my

1288
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:52,000
opinion um man i've done so many trim

1289
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,358
runs as a young kid like

1290
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,199
outside you know uh on porches you know

1291
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:59,759
not in controlled rooms at all and it

1292
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,719
was never an issue never an issue at all

1293
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,720
so trim run or dried run you know i

1294
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,559
flash dried some stuff this past year

1295
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:09,519
and i washed that

1296
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,000
the flash dried versus you know i flash

1297
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,318
dried

1298
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
the same strain and then i fresh froze

1299
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:17,039
it just to wash the two

1300
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,480
and compare myself just to see the

1301
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,599
difference from my own

1302
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,119
you know knowledge teaches you a lot i

1303
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,318
suggest anyone to do that they're just

1304
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,000
trying to like figure it out for

1305
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,318
themselves and have some fun you know

1306
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,440
take the same material give it a three

1307
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,279
to five day dry

1308
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,960
and then freeze it and then just fresh

1309
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,119
freeze it um

1310
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,400
the stuff that has a three to five day

1311
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,559
dry it was like

1312
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,400
so easy to work with it was like washing

1313
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,440
gmo it's just like

1314
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,440
you know very easy clean up there's no

1315
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,200
contaminant in the hash

1316
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,119
it's like you barely have to spray it

1317
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,960
clean you know it isn't coat in your

1318
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,160
bags it's not coating your

1319
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:57,358
spoons it's like real easy to work with

1320
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,799
so if you're gonna work with dried stuff

1321
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,719
you don't really need a cold room so

1322
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,880
much you know and uh

1323
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,078
you know maybe that's what makes the

1324
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,559
decision for you

1325
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,280
if you're like hey i am in a warm

1326
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,119
climate i don't have a cold situation

1327
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,640
i would tell you personally you should

1328
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,079
probably dry your material if you're

1329
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,759
trying to extract it

1330
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,599
and that's someone who loves washing

1331
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,280
fresh frozen first and foremost

1332
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,680
but if you don't have a cold room to do

1333
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,519
it man i don't know i'd be a little

1334
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,159
nervous dude you know that's just me

1335
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,039
personally

1336
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,078
like i said no i got freezers right now

1337
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,279
of some

1338
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,519
stuff that i'm so excited to watch but

1339
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,280
i'm not even thinking about it till come

1340
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:38,318
november you know it just

1341
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,680
doesn't seem possible when

1342
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:44,800
talking about the final product um

1343
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,598
you know it sounds like the process that

1344
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,280
you use

1345
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,039
is going to be dependent on whether or

1346
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,800
not it is fresh frozen or dried

1347
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,159
what do you see in the difference of the

1348
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,760
final product though

1349
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:59,519
at versus uh fresh frozen and dried

1350
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,200
um the first thing that comes to mind is

1351
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,519
probably terpenes but

1352
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:05,759
you've certainly seen you know a lot of

1353
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,079
um you know head-to-head comparisons of

1354
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,720
the

1355
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,640
same cultivar being run both ways what

1356
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,358
do you see the differences in the final

1357
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,279
product

1358
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:15,279
of fresh frozen versus dried

1359
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,119
you know they're different um i was just

1360
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,800
talking with a buddy the other day

1361
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:27,680
yesterday and uh

1362
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,599
to me they're very different um i think

1363
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,519
there's just this weird thing going on i

1364
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,119
feel like in the cannabis community

1365
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,199
where people just love to jump on

1366
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,039
bandwagons they don't necessarily have

1367
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,639
their own opinion but like they got

1368
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,318
someone else's opinion in their pocket

1369
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,318
who they respect and they're like oh i'm

1370
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:43,759
gonna use that person's opinion because

1371
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,358
i don't know then i align with that

1372
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,559
person or something i'm not sure what it

1373
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:48,078
is exactly but

1374
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,559
i feel like there's this whole oh

1375
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,599
indoors better than outdoor and then

1376
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,760
oh fresh frozen is better than dried

1377
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,800
and like i was even on that train too

1378
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,440
where i was like

1379
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,880
you know how would dried material make

1380
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,000
better

1381
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,480
concentrate i don't believe it

1382
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,400
so that's why i started to do it myself

1383
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,880
you know who do i trust more than most

1384
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,119
people

1385
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,960
myself so i was like all right i am

1386
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,640
going to personally start drying

1387
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,119
material and washing it

1388
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,279
even though i don't think i like that

1389
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,760
even though i think it might be a waste

1390
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,200
of my

1391
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:26,160
time i want to prove to myself

1392
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,078
that you know that this is why and i

1393
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,879
have reasons to stand by

1394
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,400
and through doing that i don't

1395
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,440
necessarily have

1396
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,079
a opinion on one being better than the

1397
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,838
other

1398
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,800
it all depends there's just too much

1399
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:44,000
um there's too much opinion involved in

1400
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,280
it where

1401
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,358
it's preference in my opinion you know

1402
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:55,040
they are different dried material

1403
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:57,279
and fresh frozen material are different

1404
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,079
and what's wrong with that what's wrong

1405
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,519
with them being

1406
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,920
different things i like i like variety

1407
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,280
i like there being other options and

1408
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,079
stuff like that

1409
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,400
so i just don't feel like we need to say

1410
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,760
fresh frozen is better and

1411
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,200
dried is inferior or vice versa to me i

1412
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,160
try to tell people now

1413
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:18,639
they make different different products

1414
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:20,558
and

1415
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,400
you're asking me what is different about

1416
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,920
them i find

1417
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,760
um you know sometimes the dried material

1418
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,159
it will make a drier

1419
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:35,359
resin um i also find sometimes

1420
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:38,078
that drier material will yield

1421
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,159
slightly more not necessarily

1422
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,079
exponentially more where you're like oh

1423
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:43,440
why are we even washing fresh frozen i

1424
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,359
haven't really found that i haven't

1425
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,079
really washed something dry versus fresh

1426
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,400
and been like

1427
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,480
the yield was twice dry i am only

1428
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,880
washing dried material from now on

1429
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,079
that hasn't happened to me very small

1430
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,760
yield increases

1431
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:01,599
i have noticed for sure um

1432
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,720
definitely different smells flavors

1433
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,720
aromas

1434
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,078
and i'm saying different i can't sit

1435
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,639
here and tell you

1436
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,559
that the fresh frozen is always louder

1437
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,078
because it hasn't been i have washed

1438
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,480
some stuff that was dried

1439
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,440
and i was like yo that that stuff is

1440
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,119
that's louder

1441
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,358
like you got them sitting next to each

1442
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,720
other and you can't help but decide

1443
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:22,880
and then i'll give them to a friend

1444
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,239
who's who's you know very experienced

1445
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,760
smokes a lot of hash

1446
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:27,439
and they can't tell me which one's

1447
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,599
frozen and which one's dried

1448
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,200
so to me that just shows you that

1449
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,240
there's a place

1450
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,000
for both there is a place for dried

1451
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:37,919
material there is a place for fresh

1452
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,838
frozen material and you'll see these

1453
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,159
people who are quick to

1454
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,159
knock the man doing the other thing oh

1455
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,719
you know fresh frozen's the way

1456
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,558
screwdriver material or screwdriver

1457
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,679
fresh frozen dries the way

1458
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,960
and to me yo there's room for for all of

1459
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,719
us in this game

1460
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,480
there's enough room for everyone so

1461
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:57,279
don't knock the other man's hustle if

1462
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,159
someone's

1463
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,760
stoked to wash fresh material you don't

1464
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,920
know why they're washing fresh material

1465
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,400
maybe they don't have a space to dry it

1466
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,920
uh

1467
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,920
you know maybe there was a problem along

1468
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,159
the crop blah blah blah who knows what

1469
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,440
but like if someone's stoked on washing

1470
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,279
fresh frozen

1471
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,960
and they're making a great product

1472
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,440
that's all i care about

1473
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,880
and if someone's washing dried material

1474
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,599
dry runs and then

1475
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,358
making great product that's all i care

1476
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,200
about you know is the end result

1477
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:26,400
i just want to be quality first and

1478
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,358
foremost

1479
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,960
you know that's what really matters and

1480
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:33,920
just something that's trippy to me that

1481
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:37,358
like always like uh

1482
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,559
interests me when i wash dried material

1483
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,440
is it always dumps in the larger micron

1484
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,480
bags

1485
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,480
if i wash something fresh frozen

1486
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,318
it'll yield you know let's say like in

1487
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,639
the 73 and 90

1488
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,558
and then i'll wash it dried and it will

1489
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:55,598
be dumping in the 120

1490
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,559
and 160. i wonder

1491
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,680
if the heads just naturally you know

1492
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,839
shrink

1493
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,199
pucker up a little bit from the drying

1494
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:04,960
process

1495
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:06,318
and then once maybe you hit them into

1496
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,960
that water

1497
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:10,318
they actually expand is what i imagine

1498
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,679
is happening i don't know what else

1499
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,119
could be going on

1500
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:18,719
um i lack a lot of

1501
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,800
um terminology

1502
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,039
and experience as far as the science

1503
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,400
goes i am the master of bro science when

1504
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,880
it comes to hashmaking

1505
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,079
and terminology i'm not going to sit

1506
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,200
here and try to

1507
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:34,640
sound like i'm a lab technician or that

1508
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:35,279
at um i have some kind of expertise that

1509
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:37,759
i don't

1510
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,440
so again a lot of knowledge i've gained

1511
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,280
is simply through experience

1512
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,720
and a lot of the conclusions i've come

1513
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,040
to are simply me

1514
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,838
just you know thinking about it and

1515
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:49,599
imagining

1516
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:52,318
it and coming to it through um uh

1517
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,920
common sense i guess you know so again i

1518
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:55,358
don't necessarily know that's what's

1519
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,079
happening with the heads but that's what

1520
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,759
i imagine

1521
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,119
is happening but something that i've

1522
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,160
seen over and over again

1523
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,800
is for some reason the the heads are

1524
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:08,159
bigger with the dried material

1525
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,599
typically bigger heads mean better hash

1526
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,759
in my experience

1527
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,599
i'm not necessarily saying that though

1528
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,359
in this regard there's just something

1529
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,599
weird where like

1530
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:19,759
i'll have the stuff dumped in the 190

1531
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,480
bag and i'm not saying it's like amazing

1532
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,440
190

1533
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,358
i'm just saying it's like when i washed

1534
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,000
it fresh frozen there was absolutely

1535
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:28,719
nothing

1536
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,519
capturable in the 190. and then i washed

1537
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:32,558
it dry

1538
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,000
and it was tons of stuff in the 190.

1539
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,599
like it just

1540
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
it's interesting to me you know you

1541
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,000
would think that a dry a

1542
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,159
fresh frozen trichome head would be

1543
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,280
bigger than one that you dried and then

1544
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,118
rehydrated

1545
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,880
but it's something that i've seen with

1546
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,240
multiple cultivars so

1547
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,920
that's just something that i've seen

1548
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,679
that i found interesting when i was

1549
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,960
physically washing the stuff

1550
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:57,679
but as far as having like a

1551
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,000
a rule of thumb for the end results like

1552
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:03,279
fresh frozen will always give you this

1553
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,039
and dry will always give you that hasn't

1554
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,160
been my personal experience

1555
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,719
you know things have surprised me

1556
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,318
and that's what keeps me doing it right

1557
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,558
on man that's beautiful like being able

1558
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:17,119
to keep that surprise in your craft

1559
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,000
too probably keeps it you know fresh

1560
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,200
instead of getting

1561
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,760
bored and ever feeling like a job so we

1562
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:24,960
were comparing the indoor versus outdoor

1563
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,160
you know regardless of

1564
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:31,920
where we do um are growing or

1565
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:35,358
where we do our mechanical

1566
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:38,400
separation we always need to make the

1567
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:42,239
plant material cold and so

1568
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,280
we turn to ice and i'd like to hear your

1569
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,919
insights on

1570
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,960
on the kinds of ice i think you were the

1571
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,000
first person

1572
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,079
who i met who actually

1573
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,599
cares so much to make his own ice which

1574
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,000
i thought was pretty badass

1575
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,960
and and it wasn't until i moved out to

1576
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,920
the country

1577
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,440
that i realized that um the water that

1578
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,920
goes into

1579
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,880
making the ice matters a lot because um

1580
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,358
there's a lot of

1581
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,680
minerals in the water out where i am now

1582
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,838
and uh it makes crappy hash so i

1583
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:12,798
actually i actually can't use my local

1584
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,639
water

1585
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,079
so um and you know everybody's got

1586
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:18,318
different preferences about you know

1587
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,119
size of ice and edges and all this kind

1588
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:22,318
of stuff

1589
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,480
well um you have run a lot of ice

1590
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:25,759
um what have what does your experience

1591
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,318
tell you and what are some of your

1592
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,319
preferences

1593
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,480
i'm going to be clear i do not make ice

1594
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,960
anymore by hand

1595
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,599
there was a time where i fully to do

1596
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,199
that

1597
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,119
and uh enough respect to all the

1598
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:42,480
hashmakers who are making uh

1599
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,119
handmade ice uh just to me it becomes

1600
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,079
like a

1601
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,480
job unto itself of making ice like man

1602
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,519
i've got hundreds of ice trays and we

1603
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,358
used to sit there and put

1604
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,920
them and i would have stand and up

1605
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,960
freezers to fill with the ice trays and

1606
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,079
like

1607
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:00,798
it was just a job unto itself to just

1608
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,839
hand make the ice definitely you know

1609
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,318
made a nice

1610
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:04,960
larger cube and we were able to use the

1611
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:08,558
ro

1612
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,280
water and uh man if you're making hash

1613
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,880
on a small

1614
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,960
scale um i'm not discouraging you

1615
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,798
by all means make your ice you know

1616
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,679
there's nothing wrong with that at all

1617
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:23,119
um uh but as far as

1618
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:25,039
practicality if you're doing stuff on

1619
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,760
scale

1620
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:30,480
uh making ice is not gonna be possible

1621
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,440
in my opinion you know you are going to

1622
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,358
require

1623
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,519
a ice machine um you know luckily

1624
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:39,920
there's a lot of reverse osmosis ice

1625
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:42,798
machines available out there

1626
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,720
manitowoc makes them oshizaki make some

1627
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:45,039
i might be pronouncing both those brands

1628
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,159
wrong

1629
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:51,920
i apologize if i am um uh

1630
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:54,318
oshizaki they make a large cube

1631
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,960
uh ice machine you know it's like one

1632
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:56,480
that like

1633
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,079
you know if you're in vegas and you get

1634
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,199
a nice glass of whiskey they give you

1635
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,240
like you know a large

1636
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:02,879
squared cube for it they make a machine

1637
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,239
that does

1638
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,720
that um you know it doesn't last very

1639
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,279
long

1640
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,399
i guess because of the nature of it or

1641
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,400
the auger and the

1642
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,798
mechanics can fail is what they've told

1643
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,798
me but they're not much more than the

1644
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:18,880
standard unit so in my opinion if you're

1645
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:19,519
gonna splurge on an ice machine i would

1646
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,039
definitely

1647
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,280
go with that larger square cube than the

1648
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:26,159
crescent cube that they typically make

1649
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,760
but uh

1650
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,598
again you know you're going to want to

1651
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,960
get an ice machine with uh

1652
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:36,318
ro water in my my opinion is important

1653
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:39,760
um uh i luckily live

1654
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:43,039
in um you know not far i'm about an hour

1655
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:46,559
from arcata california which is like

1656
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:50,000
the uh hub of all things hippie

1657
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:53,359
and uh i don't know uh

1658
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,639
natural and you know gold

1659
00:58:53,358 --> 00:59:00,000
country living and whatnot uh so

1660
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:02,879
fortunately arcata has the water store

1661
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,159
shout out miss aya's water store casey

1662
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,559
down there

1663
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:07,440
supply in all of humboldt county with

1664
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,599
the reverse

1665
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,880
osmosis ice she's got a couple ice

1666
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,318
machines down there

1667
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:16,480
as well as a very nice water store

1668
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,880
that can give you great water but she

1669
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,599
started making ice for the local hash

1670
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,440
community

1671
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,519
not specifically the local hash

1672
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,639
community but as you can imagine there's

1673
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,440
a lot of people

1674
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:29,598
up here doing it so she's providing

1675
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,079
reverse osmosis eyes for the people

1676
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,559
doing

1677
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,680
a huge community service which is really

1678
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,079
awesome of her

1679
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:37,759
so believe it or not man i drive an hour

1680
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,839
and i load up my truck

1681
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,079
and bring it back to chest freezers at

1682
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,719
my place because i have not bought an

1683
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,079
ice machine yet again something i should

1684
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:48,318
invest in myself

1685
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,280
but as i mentioned earlier in the show

1686
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,838
i'm pretty cheap

1687
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,040
you know so as far as buying an ice

1688
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:55,358
machine

1689
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,960
if you buy an ice machine to me you

1690
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,880
gotta keep it running

1691
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,720
you gotta keep it running or you're

1692
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,838
gonna have to shut it down

1693
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:05,838
take it apart clean it all store it so

1694
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:09,119
it's kind of this game of like

1695
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:12,159
i only work seasonally

1696
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,720
to me it makes sense to just get ice

1697
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,519
from her

1698
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,279
support a local business otherwise i'd

1699
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,280
have to be taking my machine apart and

1700
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,160
kind of putting it away for the summer

1701
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,440
which again

1702
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:25,440
it's not unrealistic just uh wasn't

1703
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:29,119
necessarily practical for me

1704
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,440
so yes i buy reverse osmosis ice

1705
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,358
from the store bring it out to my place

1706
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,639
store it in chest freezers and use it as

1707
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:38,880
i need it

1708
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:40,639
um not very practical maybe for everyone

1709
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,960
i have a lot of friends who make

1710
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:46,078
incredible hash

1711
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,079
and they get their ice from costco and i

1712
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,680
bust their balls about it all the time

1713
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,119
i'd like to joke about how the food

1714
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,679
poured down the way

1715
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,079
it's not too far from the ice machine

1716
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:57,598
those foot long costco hot dogs

1717
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,680
and those chicken baked terps are

1718
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,599
working their way into

1719
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:04,000
your eyes and you know their flavor and

1720
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,519
stuff but but no but seriously like i

1721
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,400
don't know like i said i know a lot of

1722
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,440
people who are

1723
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,240
are making gas station ice hash and it's

1724
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,280
fine

1725
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,159
uh obviously not all gas station ice is

1726
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,519
created equal

1727
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:17,838
you know what i mean i've been to some

1728
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:19,679
places and you're just like oh god this

1729
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:20,318
is terrible and then other places are

1730
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,318
like

1731
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:23,679
no this is great i would eat out of this

1732
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,798
cooler so

1733
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,358
to me cleanliness is first and foremost

1734
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:29,599
you know

1735
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,440
um if you don't know what your ice

1736
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:34,000
situation is like

1737
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,200
melt a bag of it in a five gallon bucket

1738
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,599
see what floats

1739
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:38,798
see what's in there drink some does it

1740
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,318
taste like chlorine

1741
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:44,960
you know like little common sense

1742
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,880
things like that you know uh i have a

1743
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,639
lot of friends who believe if the water

1744
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,920
is really cold the ice is really cold

1745
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,558
and everything's really cold it's in

1746
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,358
there so

1747
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,119
short period of time it doesn't really

1748
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:56,239
matter and i have friends who are using

1749
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,480
hose water

1750
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:00,879
and gas station ice again me personally

1751
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,760
i am using reverse osmosis water

1752
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,000
and reverse osmosis ice to me that just

1753
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,760
takes out a variable for contamination

1754
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,159
you know your water is clean you know

1755
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,760
your herbs clean you know your ice is

1756
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,879
clean and you know your equipment's

1757
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,000
clean

1758
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,240
i feel pretty good about that um so

1759
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,239
comes down to preference i've seen great

1760
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,078
hash i know great hash makers who are

1761
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:23,838
just using whatever for ice

1762
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,440
so i don't want to like put it out there

1763
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,279
that people think they have to have

1764
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,200
reverse osmosis that it's not

1765
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,920
necessarily the case at all

1766
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:33,519
um again you live on a mountain you got

1767
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,519
great spring water coming out the

1768
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,960
mountain and all cold that sounds even

1769
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,679
better than ro to me

1770
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,358
so uh you know just have clean water

1771
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:44,318
source clean water clean ice

1772
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:45,358
that's what matters that's great do you

1773
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:48,960
have um

1774
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:51,759
any insight on the size of the cubes

1775
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,440
you've mentioned preferring large uh

1776
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,240
cubes a few times

1777
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,280
um it is is that just because is that a

1778
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,959
personal preference

1779
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,720
or do you think that it actually

1780
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,400
functions better than

1781
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:04,399
smaller cubes or crushed ice

1782
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:10,160
my point for this for that mainly is i

1783
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,318
do multiple washes you know what i mean

1784
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,199
typically the stuff i'm washing requires

1785
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:16,880
three or four

1786
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,919
washes a larger cube lasts longer so you

1787
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,119
need to use

1788
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:23,200
less ice in between washes it just

1789
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,798
allows you to go through less

1790
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:30,639
um to me it really is just about

1791
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:32,400
cold cold water um the agitation

1792
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,960
and the rowing or if you're using

1793
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,599
machines that's what's breaking off

1794
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,559
the trichome head it's not necessarily

1795
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,760
the ice

1796
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,920
um ice contributing factor to that

1797
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,799
yeah i'm sure it's helping as well but

1798
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,760
again

1799
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:49,199
to me it's more about the vortex of the

1800
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,920
water that's actually

1801
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:54,000
doing the mechanical separation it's not

1802
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,680
necessarily your ice so

1803
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,199
if you want to use crushed ice use

1804
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:58,000
crushed ice you want to use big cube

1805
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,000
dice i don't really

1806
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,559
care it's really just about being cold

1807
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,239
cold cold the reason i like a larger

1808
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,280
cube is to me it helps

1809
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:09,358
just last longer so you know in between

1810
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,000
washes while that stuff's sitting

1811
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:12,558
and i'm filtering out it's on ice still

1812
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,679
some nice

1813
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,839
chunky ice that's how i see it right on

1814
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:18,879
so uh i have one question about water

1815
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:20,960
quality because we've already talked

1816
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,400
quite a bit about water quality

1817
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:28,240
you know going into the frozen ice

1818
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,720
um but uh speaking to your frugal self

1819
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,919
um you know there's a lot of folks who

1820
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,719
are working at home

1821
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:37,039
and they live rurally um and they have

1822
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,598
got maybe they've got mineralized water

1823
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,680
or maybe you know maybe they've got kind

1824
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,880
of sulfury water or you know there's a

1825
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,118
lot of variability

1826
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,358
in water as soon as well heck we could

1827
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,358
this is even a good question for

1828
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:50,480
the city grid because a lot of city grid

1829
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:53,679
water has got

1830
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,559
you know uh fluoride and chlorine in it

1831
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,919
and my question is is that you know we

1832
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,319
if we all have got

1833
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,760
the the you know the best practice of

1834
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:04,318
getting ro

1835
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,920
but ro is not available to us for

1836
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:10,159
whatever reason

1837
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,559
um how low do you think the threshold is

1838
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,920
for

1839
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:16,319
chlorine fluoride you know or

1840
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,960
or these mineralization minerals to

1841
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:20,880
actually

1842
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:23,760
impart taste to the finished product

1843
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,240
if we want to get ro that's one thing

1844
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,280
but

1845
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:30,639
but how likely do you think it is that

1846
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,880
that these these lesser than waters

1847
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:36,879
are actually going to mess with the

1848
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:39,599
final hash product

1849
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,680
to me it's like it goes to like a common

1850
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,160
sense thing is how i would approach it

1851
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:44,960
you know

1852
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:45,920
um obviously not all water water sources

1853
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,000
are created equal

1854
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,039
um you know i'm back from new england

1855
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,358
you know and uh

1856
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,119
you know a lot of my friends in vermont

1857
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:53,598
you know the water that comes out the

1858
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,480
tap

1859
01:05:53,599 --> 01:06:00,960
is seriously brown and extremely sulfury

1860
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:04,159
to me that's common sense if your tap

1861
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,639
water you know is smelling sulfury

1862
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,159
is tainted in color you're not drinking

1863
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,000
your tap water

1864
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:12,239
you know i wouldn't want to be making

1865
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,798
hash with it you know i just don't see

1866
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:16,798
how it's going to lend itself to that um

1867
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:23,599
i would do whatever i could to have

1868
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:25,919
cleaner water you know to me um

1869
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,160
it's not a fine line though it's it's

1870
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,358
like obvious it's like oh this water

1871
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,960
smells like eggs

1872
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:33,759
yeah i'm not gonna use it you know what

1873
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,240
i mean or if you taste some water

1874
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,640
in the city and you're like oh it tastes

1875
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,879
slightly chlorinated you know i'm saying

1876
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,960
ever so slightly

1877
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,880
i wouldn't necessarily be terrified to

1878
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,079
use it you know what i mean like if you

1879
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,838
live in a city

1880
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,680
your water source probably isn't that

1881
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,960
great if you're asking a hippie like me

1882
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:54,639
you know what i mean

1883
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,318
so uh it's tough you know do i expect

1884
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,838
you to go to the store and buy

1885
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,000
gallons of spring water to do your hash

1886
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:03,038
runs

1887
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,880
if you're washing in a 5 gallon bucket

1888
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,880
doesn't seem crazy to me if you're

1889
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,358
washing in 20 gallon barrel

1890
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,280
or 32 gallon barrels you know that kind

1891
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:13,519
of doesn't seem practical

1892
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,559
but to me then if you're doing that on

1893
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:21,358
scale then you invest in a water filter

1894
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:24,559
um small home bath patches

1895
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:26,078
again i go to like cooking an analogy

1896
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:27,519
like if you're cooking at your house and

1897
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,000
you're making a birthday cake for your

1898
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:30,960
kid and it requires water and your tap

1899
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,318
water is brown

1900
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,000
like are you going to use that or are

1901
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:35,440
you going to pour it out of like a jug

1902
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,039
of water you're probably going to use a

1903
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,240
jug of water to make that you know what

1904
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,480
i mean so

1905
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:42,479
to me just common sense goes a long way

1906
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,119
you know if your water's terrible don't

1907
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,719
use it

1908
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:48,240
um but just get a filter there's all

1909
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:49,038
different kinds of filters out there you

1910
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:51,919
know you can get

1911
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,359
really quality filters for 200 bucks and

1912
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,119
you can get one for five thousand

1913
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:56,960
dollars it just kind of depends on what

1914
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:58,880
you're trying to do what kind of volume

1915
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,159
of water you're trying to actually

1916
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,039
filter off

1917
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:04,639
but uh you know it's one of those things

1918
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,000
that you kind of just figure it out for

1919
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:07,199
yourself you know like if you're just

1920
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,798
trying to make a little hash for

1921
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,399
yourself at home make a little hash for

1922
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,880
yourself at home and

1923
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,720
sadly yeah you might be like you know

1924
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,319
what the water ruined this hash

1925
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,838
i've been there i've definitely done

1926
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,839
that before um

1927
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,679
and to me the only way to determine that

1928
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,439
is just a little bit of common sense you

1929
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,880
know pour a glass of that water look at

1930
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,158
that water drink that water

1931
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,000
if it's not something you're trying to

1932
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:32,399
drink like

1933
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,079
i don't know if you really want to soak

1934
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:37,278
all your resin in it you know

1935
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:38,880
like uh you know like that's just my

1936
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,080
opinion and i think it is an opinion you

1937
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,759
know what i'm saying i have other

1938
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:43,119
friends who are like hey if everything's

1939
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,359
really cold

1940
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,719
it's just an extraction thing nothing's

1941
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,560
getting absorbed

1942
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,399
you're then putting it in a freeze dryer

1943
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,279
and it's you know sublimating out all

1944
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,439
the water

1945
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:54,719
so you know i have some people who are

1946
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,158
probably going to listen to this and be

1947
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,359
like dude it doesn't matter

1948
01:08:56,158 --> 01:09:00,879
but again to me not all tap water is

1949
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:02,880
created equal

1950
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,119
fair enough so we've already talked

1951
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,838
about uh material quite a bit

1952
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:09,439
um but at this point you know we're kind

1953
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:10,479
of going through the process and we're

1954
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:12,238
we're still in the

1955
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,318
in the prepping stage you know getting

1956
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,919
getting our or

1957
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,440
getting prepared to actually make the

1958
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,640
hash and

1959
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:23,599
um what do you do as far as

1960
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,719
breaking down the flower to be most

1961
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,480
prepared

1962
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:28,480
um for the hashing process

1963
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:33,599
to me it's all about exposing the

1964
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:36,000
surface area break it down

1965
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,279
break it all the way down you got some

1966
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,880
chunky stuff

1967
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,440
you're gonna have to break it down like

1968
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:44,079
i don't like necessarily cutting

1969
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,798
into the actual flour just chopping up

1970
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,479
the flour

1971
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,238
i don't think that lends itself to

1972
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,879
making clean hash

1973
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:53,278
but again just the way the structure the

1974
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,840
natural structure of the plant

1975
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,760
allows you to break it down do it as

1976
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:01,119
much as you possibly can

1977
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,520
um you know sometimes i'll tell people

1978
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:04,238
you know

1979
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,600
keep them nickel sized small you know

1980
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:07,519
the smaller the better

1981
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,760
if you've got a big old butt in there

1982
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,400
there there is trichomes on the inside

1983
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,920
of it and

1984
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:14,079
in order for you to get those you're

1985
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,359
going to have to physically break that

1986
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:17,840
big old bud up

1987
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:19,839
in your barrel whether you're using a

1988
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,760
paddle or you're using a machine

1989
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,119
you're gonna have to wash it and wash it

1990
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,400
until that

1991
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:29,439
bud um breaks down and

1992
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:31,279
exposes all the trichomes so to me

1993
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:33,678
the best thing to do is just do that

1994
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:35,920
when you're prepping the material then

1995
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,800
you don't have to row it as hard or wash

1996
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,840
it as hard

1997
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,840
i want that resin just to fall off so me

1998
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,480
personally i spend a lot of time

1999
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,679
prepping

2000
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:47,279
and i break it all the way down and then

2001
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,640
i put my turkey bags

2002
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,439
in my freezer with them open i don't

2003
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,039
close them

2004
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:58,158
i don't compact them i leave it open

2005
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,800
for 24 hours i feel that allows the

2006
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,439
moisture

2007
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,760
to escape the bags and to get stuck on

2008
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:06,719
the walls of your freezer or whatnot

2009
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:09,119
and doesn't necessarily um create

2010
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,399
freezer burn or too much moisture in

2011
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,559
your bags

2012
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,839
um and i also feel like it allows the

2013
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,239
material to

2014
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,480
freeze quicker rather than like

2015
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,439
enclosing it and encapsulating it with a

2016
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:21,599
bag

2017
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:23,198
kind of almost you know does the

2018
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,520
thermophilic compost

2019
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:27,198
reaction where it does throw heat having

2020
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,600
all that stuff so i figure

2021
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:31,839
sleep the bags open allow it to escape

2022
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,600
the moisture you escape

2023
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,600
um you know and then also that way

2024
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,640
when you open those bags to dump them

2025
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,880
into your barrel

2026
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,079
they just fall apart when i dump my bags

2027
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,079
into my barrels

2028
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,559
it's just a bunch of loose little buds

2029
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:49,840
it's not this compressed

2030
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,960
football of like ganja you know i see a

2031
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,119
lot of people still

2032
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,719
using vac sealers and stuff for their

2033
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:57,198
material like to me

2034
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,920
don't compress your material do not

2035
01:11:57,198 --> 01:11:59,919
compress it

2036
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,800
do not pack it in your freezers all

2037
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:05,600
crazy don't stuff a freezer in a day

2038
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,119
you know work multiple freezers you know

2039
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,679
have the bags and they're all

2040
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:10,960
loose all open so that when you dump

2041
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,560
them out

2042
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,319
you want i just see it as you want

2043
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,640
everything to be gentle you want to be

2044
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,559
able to like gently roll the heads off

2045
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,440
those necks you don't want it to be this

2046
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,320
like

2047
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:25,279
forced thing so might as well just have

2048
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,920
it where all the material is exposed and

2049
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:29,039
everything can just fall off real easily

2050
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,239
right on

2051
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:35,279
so let's talk about agitation now so

2052
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:38,479
there have been so many evolutions

2053
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:41,519
in hash technique when talking about

2054
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:45,119
you know how actually to add

2055
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:48,080
motion to the ice and the flower

2056
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:49,279
to get those um you know resin heads to

2057
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:51,119
knock off when i

2058
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:52,719
when i first learned around a decade ago

2059
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:53,760
to make my own hash you know we were

2060
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,319
using

2061
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,679
uh you know the paint mixer on a drill

2062
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,039
and that was

2063
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:05,520
messy but it was efficient and

2064
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:07,760
um and it worked and then you know i

2065
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,920
we we started having the advent of these

2066
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,320
small camping washing machines and you

2067
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,520
know

2068
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,840
people are running bigger washing

2069
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,560
machines too but essentially a washing

2070
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,119
machine

2071
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,800
that you know moves it around which is

2072
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:21,599
in a much more gentle way

2073
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,719
than the paint mixers and then you know

2074
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,239
some hardcore people

2075
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,000
have come all the way around and they're

2076
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:29,678
they're using hand paddles again

2077
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
to you know be super super gentle

2078
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,279
with it and i think that each of those

2079
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,399
processes

2080
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:38,639
are all being used still today so what

2081
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:41,839
do you see as the pros and the cons

2082
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:46,880
of some of these more common uh

2083
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:50,079
you know methods for agitating

2084
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:52,880
um um i personally hand row um i

2085
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:54,399
personally use paddles and i row by hand

2086
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,000
um

2087
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:58,559
to me if you work solo or if you just

2088
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,279
have a

2089
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,800
lot of material a lot of material you're

2090
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:05,439
trying to process

2091
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,800
there is a place for machines um you

2092
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:10,479
know one person

2093
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:14,000
can only do so much so i understand

2094
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:16,799
the place for machines my gripe with

2095
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,560
machines is just the cleaning of them i

2096
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,239
just feel like

2097
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,400
you got to clean them when you're done

2098
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:25,678
clean them before you use them

2099
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:27,920
and i just feel like when

2100
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,000
you're using machines or when i've used

2101
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,359
machines i'm relying on them to run

2102
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,279
through a lot of material

2103
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:34,960
so you end up not using one machine but

2104
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:37,599
you end up using like 15

2105
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,480
machines and then your job becomes like

2106
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,920
oh every day

2107
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:41,678
cleaning these machines at the end of

2108
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,920
every day cleaning these machines

2109
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,440
and it's just a lot of maintenance and

2110
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,199
personally that's not how i

2111
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:51,439
enjoy spending my time but again uh

2112
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:53,839
if you got a bunch of material to run

2113
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,960
machines will help you do that

2114
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:00,239
me personally i like the hand row

2115
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:04,319
um the hand row

2116
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:07,439
has a physicality to it that

2117
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,759
can't be matched with a machine you know

2118
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:09,439
i

2119
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,880
joke around it's like you know when you

2120
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,639
feel

2121
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,239
that fish on the end of your rod you

2122
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,119
know what i mean there's there's a

2123
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,799
sensitivity with that that paddle that

2124
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:22,399
you can achieve

2125
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:25,360
um you know uh material

2126
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:26,719
me personally i don't have an sop you

2127
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:28,880
know a lot of people

2128
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:29,840
everyone nowadays in 2020 they all want

2129
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,840
your sop

2130
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,199
you know show me how you do this you

2131
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,239
know and

2132
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:36,799
to me you know there isn't really one i

2133
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:40,559
i

2134
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:43,679
approach each wash differently and

2135
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,440
paddling allows me to do that you know i

2136
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:48,640
can paddle

2137
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:50,960
for 15 minutes and then be like look at

2138
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,199
the result and be like you know you went

2139
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,719
too hard or you know what you're gonna

2140
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:57,839
need to go harder

2141
01:15:54,719 --> 01:16:00,000
and that allows me to determine you know

2142
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,520
okay you know what i'm gonna do this in

2143
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,158
four washes

2144
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,120
ten minutes each and i'm gonna start

2145
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,198
more gentle

2146
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:09,039
and then i'm gonna go more aggressive

2147
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:10,079
and to me that's kind of the approach

2148
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:12,880
that i start with

2149
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:14,158
is i try to make that first wash real

2150
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,960
delicate

2151
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:17,679
real pure and then i ramp up the

2152
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,039
aggression

2153
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:24,719
more and more with each wash um

2154
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:26,238
i like hand rolling to me it allows me

2155
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:29,119
to be like

2156
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:30,559
go harder or go less the machines they

2157
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:32,000
just have a timer setting

2158
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,000
and they go one way and then go the

2159
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
other way they don't really have like a

2160
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,920
aggressive washer a light walk you know

2161
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,198
what i mean obviously

2162
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,039
someone would tell you what will you

2163
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:42,879
just adjust that through time

2164
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:45,279
you know you just do a three minute wash

2165
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:48,239
versus a seven minute and i hear that

2166
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:50,000
but some material is just denser and you

2167
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:52,718
have to beat the hell out of it

2168
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,920
and some material is light and you gotta

2169
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:58,158
be gentle

2170
01:16:53,920 --> 01:17:00,960
so personally um as weird as

2171
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:02,479
hand doing anything being more

2172
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,119
consistent than a machine

2173
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:07,198
doesn't make sense but for me personally

2174
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,719
it allows me to get more consistent

2175
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:11,839
results because i just

2176
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,560
cater the way i watch based on the

2177
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,199
material

2178
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,400
if that makes sense yeah i do follow

2179
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:18,559
when

2180
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:19,519
you said that when you are using the

2181
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,039
paddle

2182
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,719
um you can get real-time feedback on

2183
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:26,880
whether or not you need to

2184
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,399
you know go less hard or go more hard

2185
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,039
and be more aggressive

2186
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:32,799
what is a sign or a signal that you are

2187
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:37,039
looking for that you have gone

2188
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,039
too hard and you need to mellow it out

2189
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,678
just green contamination in the in the

2190
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,000
product you know if you pull your bags

2191
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,279
and there's a bunch of green in there

2192
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
you've been beating the hell out of it

2193
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:51,439
you know what i mean like honestly like

2194
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,840
you know i've made very few

2195
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,559
i made very little green hash in my life

2196
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,640
very little

2197
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:00,560
um to me you gotta really be beating the

2198
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,280
hell out of it to make green hash

2199
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,800
like really going crazy soaking it for

2200
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,759
crazy long

2201
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,760
beating it for crazy long because like

2202
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,600
i've washed up a fifth time before

2203
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,119
and i've done it knowing like okay this

2204
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,000
is the fifth wash like

2205
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:18,479
give it your all like really like let's

2206
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,479
try to get every single head off this

2207
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:23,039
and let's even try to make it green like

2208
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:24,879
let's try to be so thorough that we make

2209
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:26,560
and it's hard sometimes it's literally

2210
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:30,159
hard in my opinion

2211
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:32,719
so to me you really gotta abuse the

2212
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:36,158
material like

2213
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:38,640
i've watched with kids and they like

2214
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:41,359
do this special little row that they do

2215
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:44,480
you know they like got this little like

2216
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:46,719
like uh posture that they have and they

2217
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:49,119
just do this repetitive little row

2218
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,960
and i can tell they think like this kid

2219
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:52,960
thinks he's [ __ ] rowing in a special

2220
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,920
way like this dude thinks like he's got

2221
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,399
a special row technique and like to me

2222
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,158
it's not that deep man like you you're

2223
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:00,559
just agitating the stuff you know what i

2224
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:04,238
mean

2225
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:07,360
like yeah you can do it wrong but like

2226
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:09,599
not really man to be honest like i wrote

2227
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:12,719
those bigger vessels you know bruteless

2228
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,400
dropped those large 65 gallon troughs

2229
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,319
i've gone at one with three other

2230
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:17,359
buddies before like let's just beat the

2231
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,599
[ __ ] out of this stuff

2232
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:20,479
and see what happens and like we've just

2233
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,360
been like oh

2234
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:25,439
just dumped like cool we got we got it

2235
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:27,759
out in two washes instead of three or

2236
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,238
four you know what i mean so to me

2237
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,199
it's kind of hard to like i don't know

2238
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,479
overly

2239
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:36,079
beat up the stuff that's my experience

2240
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,959
again some people are listening that's

2241
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:40,719
probably thinking i'm crazy but like

2242
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,000
i've never really done that you know

2243
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,480
i've never really like

2244
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,920
made green stuff and just totally have

2245
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:49,119
to be terrible but

2246
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:51,600
i'm often usually washing fresh frozen

2247
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,800
and like i said i am kind of going

2248
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,920
gradually you know

2249
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:59,119
multiple washes so

2250
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:02,840
um as far as the washing machines

2251
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:05,760
and hand paddling both um you know with

2252
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:08,800
experience anybody can learn

2253
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,679
what the appropriate length of time

2254
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,600
is but for the vast majority of people

2255
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:14,800
who are making hash who are making it

2256
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,639
for themselves

2257
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,159
they're never going to like really make

2258
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:23,039
enough hash

2259
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:26,158
to to know exactly when to stop

2260
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:28,238
are there any signs that you look for

2261
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:31,119
when either paddling or using the

2262
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:34,479
washing machine

2263
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:35,198
that tells you okay i have agitated

2264
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:37,359
enough

2265
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:39,198
whatever i'm gonna get is has already

2266
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:42,639
come off and now i just need to you know

2267
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:42,638
wait for it to settle in the bag

2268
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,359
to me it's just yields you know that's

2269
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:49,759
what i look to you know uh

2270
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:51,759
my first wash is gonna dump my second

2271
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,639
wash is gonna be about half what my

2272
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,880
first is

2273
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,920
my third is gonna be about half what my

2274
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,840
second is

2275
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:00,000
and then i kind of gauge what's in the

2276
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,639
bottom of that third wash you know i'm

2277
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,279
like

2278
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,679
you know what i pulled 20 grams out of

2279
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:05,679
this

2280
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,600
i know i'm gonna get 10 more off a

2281
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,480
fourth i'm gonna do it you know what i'm

2282
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,880
saying but

2283
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:13,039
sometimes you get from the first to

2284
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,159
second then that third comes and you're

2285
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:16,238
like you know what

2286
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:18,238
there's really not much [ __ ] in here

2287
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:19,198
it's kind of getting darker at this

2288
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:22,319
point

2289
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:24,479
you just know like you know like ah

2290
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:26,238
that fourth wash is gonna yield very

2291
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:28,479
little and it's gonna be green

2292
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:30,079
and sometimes though if you're that home

2293
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:31,439
washer and you only got two pounds to

2294
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:33,679
wash you might be like

2295
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:35,839
i don't care i'm just gonna keep washing

2296
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:37,840
this until there is nothing left

2297
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,079
that i've done that that's not crazy to

2298
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,639
me like i've washed stuff six times

2299
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:42,079
before

2300
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:43,760
and just pulled nothing out and then

2301
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:44,880
like oh that was a waste you know what i

2302
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,800
mean that's all it really

2303
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,960
but then you know you're like okay now i

2304
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,600
know i'm done

2305
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,600
exactly and then you know going forward

2306
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,960
oh i can wash that cultivar

2307
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,560
five times for this much time and

2308
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,319
keeping data is good i have a little

2309
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,520
book you know what i mean like to me for

2310
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,599
the hashmaker

2311
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,440
it's nice you know i'm not typically

2312
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,920
that type of person but when it comes to

2313
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:08,638
hash

2314
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,158
i do i write down how much i'm washing i

2315
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:13,119
write down you know

2316
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,839
how long i washed it for how many washes

2317
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:15,840
and then i'm

2318
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,000
writing down what i'm capturing so that

2319
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,440
i know my percentages i know what's

2320
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,119
dumping in what bag

2321
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:22,479
and it's something to reflect on you

2322
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:24,158
know what i mean you can go back and

2323
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,158
look you know and you can see how

2324
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:27,359
something washed this year that year and

2325
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:29,198
whatnot but

2326
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,439
that's the only real way to know you

2327
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:31,919
know no one knows looking at material

2328
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:33,839
how

2329
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,440
oh that's going to take 45 minutes of

2330
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,119
agitation and it will be done no one

2331
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:38,000
knows that the only way to do it is to

2332
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,559
do it you know

2333
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,920
and to me there's nothing wrong with

2334
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,840
washing material

2335
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,119
until there's nothing there you know

2336
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,760
what what's wrong with that

2337
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:49,599
you just wasted some time that's all you

2338
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,520
know and at the end of the day

2339
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,600
if you're thorough with your sprayer and

2340
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,159
cleaning the material

2341
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,719
i've made some crazy green looking stuff

2342
01:22:56,158 --> 01:22:58,879
blonde

2343
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:00,560
by just spending the time cleaning it

2344
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,480
cleaning it cleaning it spraying it

2345
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,880
cleaning it spraying it cleaning it you

2346
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:07,839
know over and over again so

2347
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,159
don't be scared to make green hash like

2348
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,719
a

2349
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:11,198
you might be able to clean it up but b

2350
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,639
like

2351
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:14,479
worse comes the worse you made some

2352
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,760
green hash and i don't know

2353
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:16,959
there's always something you know what i

2354
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,039
mean there's always something you can do

2355
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,920
with it make edibles out of it

2356
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:23,198
roll it up whatever you know what i mean

2357
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,600
i'd rather uh

2358
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:27,439
know you extracted it all than just know

2359
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,280
what's in the compost pile you know what

2360
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:31,919
i mean like uh

2361
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:33,840
i'm i'm guilty of that some days i'll

2362
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,880
wash all day long you get to the end of

2363
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,719
the day and you're like

2364
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,560
do i want to do a fourth wash on this

2365
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:40,800
[ __ ] right now like no i've already

2366
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,639
washed 15 barrels today like i don't

2367
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,880
want to do a fourth wash i know i'm

2368
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,800
throwing 40 grams of hash in my compost

2369
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,960
pile right now but like i don't want to

2370
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:53,840
do it you know and that sounds crazy but

2371
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,840
it happens right on so um

2372
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:03,440
excuse me the part of hash making that i

2373
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:06,479
like the least is uh draining the bags

2374
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:09,439
because you know it's it's um you know

2375
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:09,839
your the bags are filled with water and

2376
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:12,079
you're

2377
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,400
lifting them up to to create the

2378
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:16,479
opportunity for gravity to pull the

2379
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:18,638
water through the bags

2380
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:19,599
and you know it's heavy and it takes a

2381
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,239
long time

2382
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,079
and you know the first few runs um you

2383
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:24,638
know you're all enthusiastic and you're

2384
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:27,279
feeling

2385
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,800
robust and it's good but like you know

2386
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:29,439
if you're doing a lot over the course of

2387
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,119
the day

2388
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:33,119
you know by after lunch or feeling

2389
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:35,599
sluggish from eating and

2390
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:37,198
you know like this starts to suck and

2391
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,679
people start to cut corners

2392
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:40,238
which is dangerous at that point do you

2393
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,520
have any

2394
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:46,559
um you know insights or or tricks

2395
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,280
about you know essentially lifting the

2396
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,280
bags

2397
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:54,719
up so that the water can drain through

2398
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:54,719
uh most efficiently

2399
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,800
yeah now this is this is a serious

2400
01:24:58,238 --> 01:25:00,799
problem

2401
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,039
i've definitely been there many a times

2402
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,199
where i'm just by myself

2403
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:07,279
end of the day just defeated you know

2404
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:09,279
body just exhausted and you got like a

2405
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:11,439
45u bag that just

2406
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:13,439
will not drain and it's got like 20

2407
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:15,439
gallons of water in there and it's just

2408
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:18,000
like a hundred pounds and you can't even

2409
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:22,158
lift it you know what i mean it's

2410
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,158
it's it's stressful and uh you know uh

2411
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:26,319
just the nature of resin working with

2412
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:28,000
fresh frozen material time is of the

2413
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,238
essence you don't have time and

2414
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,399
you know the longer that that bag sits

2415
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:35,439
the longer the resin coats it and makes

2416
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:37,198
it harder to drain you know so

2417
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:38,799
personally the thing that i found the

2418
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:41,759
best is i use

2419
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,279
20 gallon bags and i use 20 gallon you

2420
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,840
know

2421
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:46,559
trash barrels little smaller 20 gallon

2422
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,960
brew

2423
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,239
trash barrels to put those in for the

2424
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:54,399
filter

2425
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:57,839
and um i use a conical drill bit and i

2426
01:25:54,399 --> 01:26:01,039
drill um holes in the bottom

2427
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:04,079
of the the 20 gallon

2428
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:07,039
brew trash barrels

2429
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:08,000
you can use as many of those as you need

2430
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:11,519
i have gone

2431
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,679
as far as i have a barrel for literally

2432
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:19,040
every bag so the 45u bag has its own

2433
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:22,000
barrel the 73u bag has its own barrel

2434
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:22,880
the the you know 90 u bag has its own

2435
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,520
barrel

2436
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:28,000
and you just stack them in each other

2437
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,920
like you normally would with the bags

2438
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,600
but you have them in its own barrel and

2439
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,600
that way you can kind of grab that

2440
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,079
barrel by the handles

2441
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,880
and you can kind of really give it hell

2442
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:38,319
force it up

2443
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,400
you know that's what you basically got

2444
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:42,319
to do is you got to break the seal

2445
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:44,479
you know the hashes naturally through

2446
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:45,599
gravity being forced on the bottom of

2447
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:47,519
that screen

2448
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,239
and it's sealing it making it hard to

2449
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,600
drain so if you can grab that barrel

2450
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:55,359
and pop it up and pop it up and force um

2451
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,120
you know that pressure that suction

2452
01:26:55,359 --> 01:27:00,158
that's starting to break

2453
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:03,359
um that will get that thing going again

2454
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:04,000
um sometimes it takes multiple pops you

2455
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:06,559
gotta really

2456
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,279
give it hell but you grab that barrel

2457
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,360
and you

2458
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:10,800
keep just just keep lifting it and

2459
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:12,158
dropping it lifting it and dropping it

2460
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,000
and lifting it and dropping it and if

2461
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:15,599
you just do that over and over again

2462
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,840
that bag will drain

2463
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:20,239
um sometimes it seems like it just will

2464
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,520
not but just keep lifting it and popping

2465
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:23,919
it keep lifting it and

2466
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,199
that's when it helps if you have a drain

2467
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,279
on your floor

2468
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,559
or you know and something large to drain

2469
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:30,479
in and you can really just

2470
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,400
take that barrel and just like put it on

2471
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:35,759
the ground if that's what you gotta do

2472
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:38,559
then that's what you gotta do um but uh

2473
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:40,639
yeah to me it helps to have those

2474
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:43,039
bruteless with holes drilled

2475
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,560
in the bottom of them for sure and again

2476
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:46,719
you could just use one

2477
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:49,199
and put all the bags in that one and

2478
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:51,359
then put that in another barrel

2479
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:52,319
um i've seen many people's different

2480
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:54,399
setups

2481
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:55,599
to where they like put a small bruteless

2482
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:57,920
on top sorry

2483
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,920
same bruteless put a small trash barrel

2484
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,600
on top of another trash barrel you'll

2485
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,920
see different people's pictures

2486
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,920
but there's all this different tech to

2487
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:08,000
just elevate that bag

2488
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,119
so that you're not really having to do

2489
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,399
much lifting

2490
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:13,599
yourself i will say that just letting it

2491
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:16,960
sit there

2492
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,960
is kind of um not the way if you just

2493
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,880
fill it up to the brim and keep adding

2494
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,920
water and it's just slowly slowly more

2495
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,079
draining

2496
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,158
the move is to not just sit there and

2497
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:27,840
look at it you need to be proactive

2498
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:30,158
even if you're just hitting the side of

2499
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,800
the barrel just over and over again i've

2500
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:34,399
seen people

2501
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:36,159
use weird machines to vibrate the barrel

2502
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:37,759
and to hit the barrel and different

2503
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:40,000
things like that but just

2504
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:42,400
agitation anything that you can keep it

2505
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,279
moving so that that water goes through

2506
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:47,679
is what you need to do i'd love to see a

2507
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:49,679
super cut of all of the crazy ideas

2508
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,079
people have come up with to agitate the

2509
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:53,199
bag

2510
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:56,079
while it's draining to try to you know

2511
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:57,519
open up the the micron filter i bet you

2512
01:28:56,079 --> 01:29:00,479
there's some crazy ass

2513
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,920
uh inventions that people have used that

2514
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:04,638
have both worked

2515
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,199
not worked and worked but been a pain in

2516
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,400
the ass

2517
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:08,238
it'd be really interesting to kind of

2518
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:10,238
see them all lined up

2519
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,599
so so this brings us to the part where

2520
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:14,319
okay so we've got our

2521
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,679
our our hash bag and the water is

2522
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:18,719
drained out

2523
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:19,440
and our glorious resin is there sitting

2524
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:22,639
in the bottom

2525
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:23,039
in the screen now i've only ever heard

2526
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,039
of

2527
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,158
or i've i've only ever experienced and

2528
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:29,600
worked one

2529
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:32,158
way to get the hash out of the bag and

2530
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,280
and you know i was taught that i i put a

2531
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,879
frisbee

2532
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:40,238
um open side of the frisbee pointed up

2533
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:43,600
and i stretch my micron screen

2534
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:46,319
over over the frisbee and um

2535
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,840
and then i i gently scrape along that

2536
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:53,359
with a

2537
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:57,199
with a sharp knife and um gently remove

2538
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:58,799
the the hash um i've never i haven't

2539
01:29:57,198 --> 01:29:59,359
made hash with a lot of other people

2540
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,600
though

2541
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:03,519
um and i'm i'm guessing that a frisbee

2542
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,039
and a sharp knife is probably not

2543
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,440
industry standard

2544
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,319
um what techniques do you like for

2545
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:12,960
removing

2546
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:12,960
hash from that delicate micron screen

2547
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:21,760
so this is when uh the game kind of

2548
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:23,759
changed um due to freeze dryers

2549
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,199
this is when um the game kind of changed

2550
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,159
due to freeze dryers

2551
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:30,319
um you know it used to be kind of a

2552
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:34,079
harder process when you had to

2553
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:37,599
gather um the resin out the bags

2554
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:38,719
and whatnot um now thankfully due to the

2555
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,199
freeze dryers

2556
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,399
it's not this technical thing anymore in

2557
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:45,519
my opinion

2558
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:49,279
um you really want it to be wet when you

2559
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:52,080
put it in your freeze dry trays um

2560
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:54,719
wetter the better that allows the water

2561
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:56,960
to actually sublimate out i see a lot of

2562
01:30:54,719 --> 01:31:00,239
people trying to dry their patties

2563
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,039
and that is not the way you need the

2564
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:03,119
water

2565
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:04,319
in order for the water to be able to

2566
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:07,198
escape um

2567
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:08,319
that's just how sublimation works so

2568
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:12,319
again

2569
01:31:08,319 --> 01:31:12,880
we're now pouring this very liquidy

2570
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:15,759
stuff

2571
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,440
into trays there it is much easier in my

2572
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,039
opinion you're just scooping it out as

2573
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:21,119
quickly as possible pouring it in the

2574
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:24,399
trays and loading it into the machine

2575
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:25,920
um that's why i love freeze dryers

2576
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:28,559
there's a lot of people who are still

2577
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,960
hand drying hash air drying hash that's

2578
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,520
cool

2579
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,480
i'm not one of them i'm when i wash i'm

2580
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,840
usually doing

2581
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:39,198
production um and the the freeze dryer

2582
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:42,319
allows that to be possible um air drying

2583
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:46,238
to me is a art unto itself

2584
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:49,119
um just a different thing um

2585
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:51,279
that i personally have moved away from

2586
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:53,920
and i am not looking back

2587
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:55,039
i am not looking back to continue

2588
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,279
microplaning

2589
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:58,639
continue air drying now that i have

2590
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:01,119
freeze dryers personally

2591
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,000
um it changed everything for me for the

2592
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:04,399
better

2593
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,479
wow being so i have yet to use an air

2594
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:09,839
dryer i certainly have shopped them

2595
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:11,759
and and have have enjoyed the quality of

2596
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,600
you know sandy blonde hash that comes

2597
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,000
out of them but

2598
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,039
that description that you gave of that

2599
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,039
that hashy

2600
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:20,158
slurry that you're just able to pour

2601
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:24,079
right out of the bag

2602
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:26,559
into the tray god that sounds like um

2603
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:28,639
that sounds really convenient and

2604
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,760
efficient right it's just it's just made

2605
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:33,039
me realize like god

2606
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:36,560
i really need to reconsider uh getting

2607
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:38,639
um a dryer like that um so but for the

2608
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,039
folks who are not going to be doing that

2609
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:41,119
uh

2610
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,960
folks like you know most of us who are

2611
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:46,479
going to be air drying

2612
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:49,600
um once you have the the micron

2613
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:52,879
screen taut over something like

2614
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:55,360
a frisbee and and you are

2615
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,359
removing it as much as you can from the

2616
01:32:55,359 --> 01:33:00,479
screen

2617
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:03,759
what do you recommend that people

2618
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:06,399
put that hash on to

2619
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,000
start the process of air drying you know

2620
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:10,319
the classic is the pizza

2621
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,238
box right as a matter of fact there's

2622
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:13,920
it's totally funny that the pizza place

2623
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:16,399
here on the island

2624
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,039
um where i live on vacheron island they

2625
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:19,839
are so

2626
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,760
used to people coming in and just buying

2627
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,760
pizza boxes for hash

2628
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,840
because there's so much cannabis

2629
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:27,600
produced historically on my island that

2630
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,360
that the pizza place knows

2631
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,280
what they're going to be used for and

2632
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:32,880
everybody gets a chuckle out of it

2633
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:35,439
but um but you know people have been

2634
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:38,639
using pizza boxes for a long time

2635
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:40,158
and i suspect there are much better

2636
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:42,400
options to use

2637
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:44,238
so so what do you recommend to folks if

2638
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:47,839
if they're not going to go

2639
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:47,839
the uh the freeze dryer away

2640
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,440
uh see again this is just like something

2641
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,479
that like uh

2642
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:57,039
i don't wanna necessarily uh dive down

2643
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:00,319
because

2644
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:00,880
it's been literally probably two years

2645
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:04,000
since i

2646
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:06,079
air dried hash um

2647
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,119
it's just really not my focus it's not

2648
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:09,198
what i'm into

2649
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:11,359
um and i will say though the last times

2650
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:12,879
i did do it i totally used pizza boxes

2651
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:15,359
like everybody else

2652
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,000
i would freeze the patties you know take

2653
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:18,000
them out

2654
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,439
freeze the patties and then microplane

2655
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,639
them onto

2656
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:24,238
um onto cardboard you know and to me it

2657
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,480
was never perfect

2658
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:28,879
wasn't ideal and that's why i've moved

2659
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:30,479
away from it personally

2660
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,480
so one of the things that you know i

2661
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:35,959
know that microplaning is

2662
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:39,519
um you know kind of standard for

2663
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:42,639
non-commercial um

2664
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:44,000
you know production um i've always had

2665
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,600
the idea though that

2666
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,079
you know i don't particularly like

2667
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:51,199
microplaning because

2668
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:54,319
if i am using the microplane and i am

2669
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:55,439
rupturing the trichomes um that is

2670
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:58,719
releasing

2671
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:00,960
the oil to become in contact with air

2672
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,239
and sure my my hash is going to get

2673
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,359
oxidized anyway

2674
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:07,439
if i'm going to be um air drying it but

2675
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:09,599
it's also creating

2676
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:10,879
an opportunity for the terpenes that are

2677
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:14,079
within the resin

2678
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,880
to touch the air and to just simply you

2679
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:18,000
know

2680
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,679
you know go away

2681
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,760
right you know like they're so they're

2682
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:24,800
so easily volatilized

2683
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:27,440
that i i suspect i'm losing terpenes is

2684
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,079
is that a fair concern when microplaning

2685
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:30,559
or or

2686
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:34,399
am i being or am i aware of a concern

2687
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,400
that really is doesn't play out

2688
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:40,399
i mean that goes back to me to common

2689
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:42,880
sense i completely agree with you

2690
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:43,759
how could grinding a glandular trichome

2691
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,920
head across

2692
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,280
a sharp metal surface not potentially

2693
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,079
rupture multiple

2694
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:51,279
i imagine it is and that's why to me

2695
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:55,039
personally

2696
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:56,158
i feel that microplaning is inferior to

2697
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:59,920
the freeze dryer

2698
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:02,158
i feel air drying is inferior

2699
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,279
to the freeze dryer that's just how i

2700
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:06,158
personally feel

2701
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:08,559
i have friends think um you know air

2702
01:36:06,158 --> 01:36:09,279
drying is the way it makes a superior

2703
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,520
product

2704
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,920
i have never experienced that not once

2705
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,560
in my life have i ever seen air dried

2706
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,480
stuff

2707
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,639
next to a freeze dried and been like oh

2708
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:21,519
that's better i never have

2709
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:23,118
um i understand someone sitting at home

2710
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:26,159
doesn't necessarily have

2711
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:28,000
access to a freeze dryer um so you're

2712
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:30,399
just gonna have to dry it any way you

2713
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,960
possibly can

2714
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:35,039
breaking it down exposes the surface

2715
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:37,118
area and allows it to dry quicker that's

2716
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:39,279
why people microplane is simply because

2717
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:42,719
it breaks it all the way down

2718
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:45,920
um i've seen people use credit cards

2719
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:47,600
knives just push it through a sieve

2720
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,319
there's many ways you can go about

2721
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,960
breaking it down further if you want to

2722
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:54,799
um it's just going to be in my opinion

2723
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,239
about trial and error and seeing which

2724
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,600
one works for you

2725
01:36:56,238 --> 01:37:03,919
um i hate to promote

2726
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:06,719
freeze dryers so hard to the home person

2727
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,079
but just to me it really was a game

2728
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:11,118
changer you know

2729
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:12,960
definitely an investment nonetheless but

2730
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:15,519
if you're making enough

2731
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,560
cash to fill a freeze dryer then to me

2732
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,560
it's a no-brainer

2733
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,080
it pays for itself really quickly yeah

2734
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,280
yeah it's one of those economies of

2735
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:23,519
scale like if you're going to be

2736
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:26,000
producing enough to fill that

2737
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,360
that dryer it'll pay for itself the

2738
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,158
first time you use it

2739
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:31,439
and and so that it is for that but you

2740
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:34,479
know to be inclusive of

2741
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:38,158
all the home folks um you know

2742
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:40,718
put pushing through a sieve and then

2743
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,638
um and then removing the water just

2744
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:43,679
simply with evaporation is still

2745
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,359
incredibly common

2746
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,800
and and i know that you you know you

2747
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,000
don't practice this anymore but i'm

2748
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,840
going to take one more step down

2749
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,319
this path because there's a lot of

2750
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,639
people who are listening who like me

2751
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:56,158
this is this is what we got right and so

2752
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,199
this is the process that we're going to

2753
01:37:56,158 --> 01:37:59,920
use so

2754
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:01,039
so once the once the the hash material

2755
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,158
is pushed through

2756
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:05,039
a strainer or a sieve which helps break

2757
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:07,279
it up

2758
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:08,238
on the pizza box perhaps a pizza box

2759
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:11,359
covered with

2760
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:12,959
parchment um you know i see

2761
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:14,799
there's a lot of different versions of

2762
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,359
people maybe you know

2763
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,800
putting the pizza boxes in a tent or

2764
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:21,599
putting them in front

2765
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,960
of a box fan some people who have got a

2766
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,639
nice enclosed area

2767
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:29,359
they'll put in a box fan for rotation

2768
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,319
and potentially an air conditioner to

2769
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:32,399
keep it cool

2770
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:33,759
and then potentially a dehumidifier to

2771
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:36,399
help remove the water

2772
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,800
as well um you know if you can reach

2773
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:39,759
back

2774
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:41,440
two years into your experience was there

2775
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:45,840
a particular setup that you

2776
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:45,839
liked when you actually did air dry

2777
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,920
i like it doing it in the cold to me

2778
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:53,118
it's all about doing it in the cold

2779
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:56,239
you can pretty much dry hash in a

2780
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:56,559
regular freezer almost all the way you

2781
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:00,079
know

2782
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:02,400
to me cold is the way to do it not

2783
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:03,840
warm but cold as cold as you possibly

2784
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:05,198
can get it

2785
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,800
well that's a really that's a really

2786
01:39:05,198 --> 01:39:07,678
interesting idea i hadn't not even

2787
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:11,279
considered that

2788
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:13,920
it's the same process that eventually uh

2789
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:16,000
you know freezer burns food but if

2790
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:19,118
you're only using it for a few days

2791
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:22,719
the the nature of the freezer um

2792
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:23,519
is dehydrating and and putting it in a

2793
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,920
freezer

2794
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,920
you will not only keep it cold and keep

2795
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,639
those terps from volatilizing

2796
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:31,679
but you are evaporating out the water

2797
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,679
well

2798
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,279
you just upgrade upgraded my game i'm

2799
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:39,118
going to be doing that next time

2800
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:41,279
um that's right there's lots of ways

2801
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:43,118
and like i said please reach out to

2802
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:46,880
someone like reach out to like

2803
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:48,880
cush kirk um brandon he loves air drying

2804
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,719
he's like real passionate about it so

2805
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:51,520
like i'm not trying to be big and

2806
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:53,840
suddenly

2807
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:56,080
shut down when it came to this for you

2808
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:59,039
know where the conversation switched

2809
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:59,760
i just don't like to like talk on stuff

2810
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:02,479
that i'm not

2811
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,039
super familiar with not actively doing

2812
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,079
now

2813
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:08,399
i just don't want to sound um um

2814
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:10,399
naive um so like i said i'm sorry to be

2815
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:13,439
vague about

2816
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:15,039
hand drying or air drying um

2817
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:17,039
i just haven't been doing it a lot

2818
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:20,158
recently i don't want to

2819
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:20,800
you know talk on it too much but like i

2820
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:24,000
said

2821
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,360
brandon um does it uh

2822
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,359
there's a lot of a lot of people out

2823
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:28,880
there that are doing it still um simply

2824
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,279
adam he's one too

2825
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,880
uh please by all means you're trying to

2826
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,960
air dry hand dry

2827
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,480
you can do it there's many ways to do it

2828
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,319
you can do it with d hums you can do it

2829
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:39,519
with heat you can do it with coal to me

2830
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:42,079
the way is cold

2831
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,639
right on so the last thing before we go

2832
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:45,679
to

2833
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:48,159
our second commercial break is is uh

2834
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:48,880
kind of like a like a systemic strategy

2835
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:52,079
right

2836
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:54,719
um you know you you've used the idea of

2837
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:56,399
cooking and recipes several times and

2838
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:59,439
you know there's a there's this

2839
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:00,079
idea in french cooking of of mison place

2840
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:02,079
which is you

2841
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:03,920
you cut all your ingredients and you get

2842
01:41:02,079 --> 01:41:04,960
all your your stuff out and on the

2843
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:07,520
counter

2844
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,840
before you start so that you're not like

2845
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,840
oh where the hell did i put the whatever

2846
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,119
when you're in the process of cooking

2847
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:16,000
the meal

2848
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:18,158
and um i suspect that we've not talked

2849
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,520
about this that you are probably a

2850
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:22,638
person who is

2851
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:24,239
um you know maybe not now since you are

2852
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:27,279
so experienced but

2853
01:41:24,238 --> 01:41:29,039
writing a list of what your process

2854
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:32,158
is and making sure that you have

2855
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:34,479
everything out in advance

2856
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:36,319
you know is is probably a good idea

2857
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:38,559
especially for folks that are

2858
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:39,840
trying to teach themselves how to do

2859
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,400
this you know

2860
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,840
the less pressure or the more time you

2861
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:46,158
can buy for yourself

2862
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,119
as you're actually in the moment making

2863
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:49,679
the hash

2864
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:52,079
is probably the best thing so so what do

2865
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:54,560
you recommend for people as far as like

2866
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:56,319
you know you got all your materials what

2867
01:41:54,560 --> 01:42:01,840
do you recommend for people for like

2868
01:41:56,319 --> 01:42:01,840
a a smart efficient setup

2869
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:05,759
you don't need much you know what i mean

2870
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:07,599
like you really don't need much

2871
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,800
um you know my room is probably about

2872
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:12,400
eight by ten

2873
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:14,320
uh that's all it really is you know uh

2874
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:15,519
i definitely have a sink in there it's

2875
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:17,759
going to help to have a

2876
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:19,440
deep sink so you can rinse your bags as

2877
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,920
soon as possible as soon as you pull

2878
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:21,759
them out

2879
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:23,520
that's really important with fresh

2880
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,119
frozen material is you know cleaning

2881
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,239
them almost instantly

2882
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:30,319
um so having a sink with water is good

2883
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:32,479
um i like to have a wall a large

2884
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:35,359
reservoir there that's there

2885
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:35,839
that um holds all the water that i need

2886
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:38,238
you know

2887
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,159
some places labs i work they have you

2888
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:41,279
know enough water that's on demand

2889
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:43,439
that's really nice

2890
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:44,479
i like to have a large reservoir that i

2891
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:46,319
can ice down

2892
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:48,479
personally you know something that i can

2893
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:51,118
physically be dropping ice into

2894
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:51,839
so that my water source is nice and cold

2895
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:54,000
so

2896
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,840
i like to have a reservoir that you know

2897
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,840
has enough water for the day and that i

2898
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:01,119
can continually drop

2899
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,600
ice into uh you know i like to have a

2900
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:04,000
small

2901
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,800
freezer in my workspace so that i can

2902
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,719
have my

2903
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:09,119
material in there and it's going

2904
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,079
straight from the freezer into the bags

2905
01:43:09,118 --> 01:43:13,039
you know and

2906
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:14,639
also have enough ice on demand in there

2907
01:43:13,039 --> 01:43:15,679
if you don't have the ice machine

2908
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:19,520
present

2909
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:22,719
um so it's nice to have that um you know

2910
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,880
personally i have my freeze dryer in my

2911
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:26,158
cold room so that it's right there so

2912
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,800
that i am you know

2913
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:31,039
my my freeze dryer is on and running so

2914
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,360
it is all cold the trays are cold so

2915
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:33,439
that

2916
01:43:31,359 --> 01:43:35,599
when i am putting it into there it is

2917
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:38,799
going from like you know the cold room

2918
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:40,960
into that negative 40 almost instantly

2919
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:43,279
it freezes in minutes you know

2920
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:45,600
so it's nice to have the freeze dryer in

2921
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:48,399
the cold room right next to you

2922
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,679
um in a perfect world you would have a

2923
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:52,000
drain in your floor

2924
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:53,440
you know obviously that's not ideal but

2925
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,039
working outside

2926
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:58,879
takes care of that situation as well

2927
01:43:57,039 --> 01:44:01,198
it's nice to have a assortment of

2928
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,440
different size spoons on

2929
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:06,238
you know just small medium large spoons

2930
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:08,158
have them on a nice metal tray so that

2931
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:11,519
they're all nice and clean

2932
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:13,439
um helps to have you know some hand

2933
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,040
sprayers little pump sprayers filled

2934
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:16,479
with alcohol you know

2935
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:19,439
just so you can keep cleaning your

2936
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:22,559
utensils clean your bags

2937
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:23,919
um i also like to have a sprayer so that

2938
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:27,360
you can spray

2939
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:30,079
on the hash whether you're using a hand

2940
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:31,839
and pump sprayer from chapman use that

2941
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:33,439
for years that works

2942
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,840
you know a lot of people now are using

2943
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:38,559
those like nine gallon flow zone

2944
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,920
um you know battery operated pumps to

2945
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:41,920
spray with

2946
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,600
other people labs i'm seeing people are

2947
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,079
you know basically getting these things

2948
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:48,079
installed so they have water pumps with

2949
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,679
little sprayers at the end of it

2950
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:51,439
i like that because then you can kind of

2951
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:53,600
have a reservoir for your

2952
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:55,678
hand sprayer so you can ice down that

2953
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,119
real nice and have as much water as you

2954
01:44:55,679 --> 01:45:00,639
need and not have to be

2955
01:44:57,118 --> 01:45:03,118
pumping all day long possibly

2956
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:03,840
um and then obviously just an assortment

2957
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:08,000
of barrels

2958
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,760
barrels to row in barrels for your bags

2959
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,679
it's always good to have extra barrels

2960
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:13,440
just to like throw bags in while you

2961
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:17,039
work and whatnot

2962
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:17,599
never hurts but uh i feel like that's

2963
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:19,118
pretty much

2964
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,719
everything that's in my room you know

2965
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:22,479
there's not really much in there it's

2966
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:24,079
kind of just an open space so that you

2967
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:26,399
got room to work in

2968
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:28,399
right on so we're going to talk about

2969
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:30,879
storage next but let's do that after

2970
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:33,118
the commercial break you are listening

2971

01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,560
chances are high that you are very

2977
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:45,678
particular about the inputs you use for

2978
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,760
growing

2979
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:50,158
people like us painstakingly

2980
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,880
self-educate on cannabis nutrients and

2981
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:53,599
techniques

2982
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:55,840
so we can cultivate the best tasting and

2983
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,280
cleanest flowers possible

2984
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,279
and when we go to purchase those

2985
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:01,198
nutrients we want to be sure that our

2986
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:04,000
supplier shares our values

2987
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:06,039

available

3002
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:37,118

product for quality

3004
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:40,639
and determine that there isn't a better

3005
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,840
version of the product that he could be

3006

3029
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:33,279
while i love growing under the sun

3030
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,000
there's a lot of good reasons to grow

3031
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:35,920
indoors

3032
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,679
and if you're like most folks you want a

3033
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,679
lighting source that grows high yielding

3034
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:41,440
healthy plants without using excessive

3035
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:43,520
amounts of electricity

3036
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:44,559
bios lighting creates biological

3037
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:46,239
lighting solutions

3038
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,800
that brings the natural brilliance of

3039
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:50,799
the outdoors into your grow room

3040
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,480
bios lighting has the attributes that i

3041
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,440
look for in a horticultural lighting

3042
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:55,279
solution

3043
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:56,879
i've bought those cheap lights online

3044
01:47:55,279 --> 01:47:58,238
and they're difficult to work with and

3045
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,279
fail in no time

3046
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:03,279
in contrast my bios led light is

3047
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:06,559
industrial grade to last a long time

3048
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:08,079
it is ip66 wet rated so little foliar

3049
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,920
overspray won't harm it

3050
01:48:08,079 --> 01:48:11,920
it is easy to clean without taking it

3051
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,480
down and of course the most important

3052
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,719
aspect

3053
01:48:12,479 --> 01:48:16,879
it is built for the exact light spectrum

3054
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,158
i want for great yielding healthy

3055
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,520
cannabis plants

3056
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:21,759
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

3057
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:24,000
rigs look badass too

3058
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:25,520
many horticultural led lighting systems

3059
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,600
are based on irrelevant performance

3060
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,880
metrics and people love to argue online

3061
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,719
about these numbers

3062
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,118
i prefer to judge on par photon

3063
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,880
efficiency and how happy my plants are

3064
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:37,198
and the bios lights exceed my

3065
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:39,440
expectations in these categories

3066
01:48:37,198 --> 01:48:41,839
bios lights have an optimized broad

3067
01:48:39,439 --> 01:48:42,960
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis

3068
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,719
and plant growth

3069
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,719
while also providing the ideal

3070
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:48,639
conditions for superior par

3071
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:51,039
efficacy and a comfortable visual

3072
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:53,760
experience i also love their attentive

3073
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:56,000
and over-educated customer service folks

3074
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,000
bios starts with a team of biologists

3075
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,800
before getting the electrical engineers

3076
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,479
involved

3077
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,800
they have studied how light impacts

3078
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:04,399
cannabis plants and devised an overall

3079
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,760
strategy that works

3080
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:08,638

01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:37,920
hashmaker ganja gil the ice book

3128
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,719
so at this point we have got ourselves

3129
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:42,239
some hash

3130
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:42,719
made and it is ready to rock and my

3131
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:45,519
question

3132
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:46,399
for you gill is curing you know a lot of

3133
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:50,000
people believe

3134
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:53,198
that some special magic happens um

3135
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,920
from the interplay of the the terpenes

3136
01:50:53,198 --> 01:50:56,399
and the other

3137
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,679
subtle you know organic compounds that

3138
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:01,359
are in the hash

3139
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:04,000
that make it something more than simply

3140
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:05,519
a a trichome that's been removed from

3141
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,079
the plant

3142
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:09,440
what are your thoughts on on curing to

3143
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:12,800
capture

3144
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:15,519
any of that increase in quality from

3145
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,520
just time

3146
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:21,279
yeah curing is interesting um you know

3147
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:23,198
curing

3148
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:25,198
you know i feel like you know with flour

3149
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:26,799
it's just essentially letting the flour

3150
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,839
marinate in its own aromas

3151
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:32,560
that's what it is um with resin

3152
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,480
you know it's tough because you're you

3153
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:37,760
know i'm typically washing fresh

3154
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:40,079
frozen resin and then when it comes out

3155
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:40,880
i want to keep it cold so it's this

3156
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,639
process

3157
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:48,079
of continuing to keep it cold

3158
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:51,279
so what i would call you know

3159
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:53,359
fresh resin

3160
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:55,519
i don't know if it's really curing all

3161
01:51:53,359 --> 01:51:57,439
that much in my freezer you know me

3162
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:59,440
personally my melt

3163
01:51:57,439 --> 01:52:00,879
i have to keep it in my freezer

3164
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:05,919
otherwise it'll grease

3165
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:07,840
so in my freezer is it really curing

3166
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:09,440
i'm not really sure it is you know

3167
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,159
that's that's where i stand with it the

3168
01:52:09,439 --> 01:52:12,079
melt

3169
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:13,598
i'm not sure if it's really doing much

3170
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:14,960
while in that freezer i don't know if

3171
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:15,599
it's getting better you know i have

3172
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,760
freezer

3173
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:20,000
i have melt in my freezer from two years

3174
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:22,480
ago i don't know if it's much

3175
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,439
different today than it was two years

3176
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:25,759
prior

3177
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:26,960
for me the curing process really comes

3178
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:30,159
into play

3179
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,800
with rosin you know me personally i'm

3180
01:52:30,158 --> 01:52:33,598
not

3181
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:34,800
so much into the traditional hashish the

3182
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:38,000
temple balling

3183
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:38,400
and stuff like that the pucks that's not

3184
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,880
me

3185
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:42,079
i keep my full melt at freezer

3186
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,480
temperature

3187
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:46,639
that's the way to keep it pixie dust

3188
01:52:44,479 --> 01:52:47,678
beach sand whatever you want to call it

3189
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:49,118
you know so

3190
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:50,560
me personally it's staying in the

3191
01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:51,920
freezer and i don't think my hash is

3192
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,039
really curing too much in there in my

3193
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,039
opinion

3194
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:57,359
i then take the hash and i turn it into

3195
01:52:55,039 --> 01:53:00,319
rosin and there is definitely a very

3196
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:01,118
big difference between freshly pressed

3197
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:03,679
rosin

3198
01:53:01,118 --> 01:53:04,799
and cured rosin there is absolutely a

3199
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:07,199
difference into that

3200
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,320
so and to me it goes back to they're

3201
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:10,960
just two very

3202
01:53:08,319 --> 01:53:12,158
different things i'm not willing to call

3203
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,520
one superior

3204
01:53:12,158 --> 01:53:16,638
to the other um i really enjoy fresh

3205
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:19,679
press rosin

3206
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:22,159
i also enjoyed cured rosin so

3207
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,118
it kind of again to me they're just

3208
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:26,158
different things

3209
01:53:23,118 --> 01:53:29,279
um when it comes to

3210
01:53:26,158 --> 01:53:31,198
curing the rosin you know uh most people

3211
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:34,960
these days are calling it a cold

3212
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:37,198
cure um it's one of those

3213
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,399
funny things about the industry where no

3214
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:41,919
one is curing it

3215
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:43,679
in the cold sadly if you cold cure rosin

3216
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:46,480
it's going to actually give you

3217
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:48,960
a real dry texture kind of the opposite

3218
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:51,598
of what people are trying to achieve

3219
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,960
through the curing prop process you know

3220
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:55,199
people want that wet

3221
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:56,239
batter and again the way you get that

3222
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:58,238
wet batter

3223
01:53:56,238 --> 01:53:59,839
is by letting your rosin sit in my

3224
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:03,039
opinion at a

3225
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:06,000
you know 70 degrees or higher

3226
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:06,639
you know 70 to 90 is kind of perfect you

3227
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,039
know

3228
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:11,359
once you start pushing the temperatures

3229
01:54:09,039 --> 01:54:13,198
i start to call it more like a jam

3230
01:54:11,359 --> 01:54:14,479
tech or jar tech you know you're gonna

3231
01:54:13,198 --> 01:54:18,559
start crashing stuff

3232
01:54:14,479 --> 01:54:22,319
out so me personally i am never heating

3233
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:25,039
post press i just you know press it

3234
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:26,158
and then let it sit at room temperature

3235
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:28,880
essentially

3236
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:30,960
um i live in trinity county so it is

3237
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:33,039
very hot in the summertime so i have a

3238
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,560
pantry that gets a little warmer than my

3239
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:36,399
house that's air conditioned

3240
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:38,560
so i'm personally putting my jars in

3241
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:40,960
that room that's slightly warmer

3242
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:42,000
just takes several days depending on

3243
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:44,399
strain

3244
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,760
it goes through the marbling process and

3245
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:49,039
then ends up being

3246
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,159
one um tone and then you essentially

3247
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:53,279
just stir it

3248
01:54:50,158 --> 01:54:53,920
you whip it you press it you uh compact

3249
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:57,198
it

3250
01:54:53,920 --> 01:55:00,480
and give yourself that wet batter um

3251
01:54:57,198 --> 01:55:01,919
texture um which people like to refer to

3252
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:04,959
as cold cured

3253
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:07,279
um some people are then not getting a

3254
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:09,118
wet enough consistency for their liking

3255
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:10,319
so then they're putting it in an oven at

3256
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:13,198
200 degrees

3257
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:14,960
and heating it to give it that more wet

3258
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:18,479
sweaty texture

3259
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:21,599
again personally that goes against my

3260
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:24,959
beliefs and what i'm trying to do um

3261
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:25,760
i'm seriously just trying to do it with

3262
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,920
like i said

3263
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:29,360
room temperature essentially yeah the

3264
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,440
idea of reheating it

3265
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:33,519
after the fact oh my gosh that sounds

3266
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:35,678
like that'd be terrible for volatilizing

3267
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:37,679
all those all those terps that you've

3268
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:38,399
gone through so much effort at this

3269
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:40,158
point

3270
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:41,598
to be able to preserve it's like it's

3271
01:55:40,158 --> 01:55:45,198
like giving them all back

3272
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:48,239
there at the end the other thing that um

3273
01:55:45,198 --> 01:55:50,479
is remarkable or or worth remark from

3274
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:53,839
the curing that you just described

3275
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:56,399
unlike when we're making temple balls

3276
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:57,679
or or pressed uh hashish bricks or

3277
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:00,719
something like that

3278
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:01,118
that is often so the the you know that

3279
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:04,319
the

3280
01:56:01,118 --> 01:56:06,799
hashish components can intermix and kind

3281
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:08,880
of like evolve their flavor together

3282
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,840
it sounds like the curing process you're

3283
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,279
describing

3284
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:16,400
is not so much for the evolution

3285
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:17,279
of the taste it sounds like it's more

3286
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:20,638
about

3287
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:24,559
um getting the hash rosin to a

3288
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:28,159
a uniform consistency

3289
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:29,199
and stability so that it stays the way

3290
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:33,198
you want it to be

3291
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:34,799
over time um is that a an agreeable

3292
01:56:33,198 --> 01:56:37,759
you know understanding of what you're

3293
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,760
what you're suggesting

3294
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:41,119
yeah i don't really disagree with that

3295
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:42,559
that's a that's a good uh that's a good

3296
01:56:41,118 --> 01:56:43,439
way of looking at it for sure it's

3297
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,639
definitely

3298
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:50,638
about texture um you know

3299
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:52,400
the the art of hashies is a deep complex

3300
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:56,239
thing there's a lot of you know

3301
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:58,079
traditional hashish methods that exist

3302
01:56:56,238 --> 01:56:59,359
um you know the aging and the what not

3303
01:56:58,079 --> 01:57:02,960
that you're talking about

3304
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:05,759
there that is that is very valid

3305
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,000
and there are many people doing that

3306
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,520
it's just not necessarily what i am

3307
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,520
currently focused on

3308
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:14,480
from watching from watching fresh frozen

3309
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:16,480
material

3310
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:17,678
we're focused on terp preservation

3311
01:57:16,479 --> 01:57:18,879
that's what we're trying to do we're

3312
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:20,639
trying to preserve

3313
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,239
those terpenes at all costs and that's

3314
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:23,920
why we're freezing material

3315
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:25,598
we're washing it cold that's why we're

3316
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:28,800
freeze drying it

3317
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:32,719
you know to me letting hash sit

3318
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:34,719
at room temperature simply degrades

3319
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:37,359
terpenes that's just a fact to me

3320
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:38,880
just happens um you know some people

3321
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:41,279
will tell you

3322
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:43,199
the ones that stick out and the ones

3323
01:57:41,279 --> 01:57:44,800
that last

3324
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:46,960
are what it's about you know that's what

3325
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,440
frenchie can only told me is he likes

3326
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:49,359
you know

3327
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:50,960
the stuff to sit out and age and the

3328
01:57:49,359 --> 01:57:53,519
terpenes that are

3329
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,279
able to like still stay you know the

3330
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,800
ones that don't dissipate

3331
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:58,399
you know that's what's interesting to

3332
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:02,320
him you know he he

3333
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:05,039
really enjoys the aging of hash

3334
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:08,000
personally me and what a lot of people

3335
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:09,679
are doing in california right now

3336
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,840
that that's not what we care about you

3337
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:15,039
know like we are trying

3338
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:18,480
to preserve those things that just

3339
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:20,399
evaporate we're trying to hold on to

3340
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:22,479
those things that

3341
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:24,079
just eventually aren't there anymore

3342
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:26,079
we're trying to preserve that

3343
01:58:24,079 --> 01:58:27,599
that's what it's all about washing fresh

3344
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:28,399
frozen that's what the freeze dryer is

3345
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,800
about

3346
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:33,039
you know me personally i don't care

3347
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,360
about having 10 year old hash

3348
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:37,920
i'm not trying to like have stuff in 20

3349
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:40,319
years and open it up and be like

3350
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,520
oh this is 20 years old that doesn't

3351
01:58:40,319 --> 01:58:44,719
appeal to me

3352
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:46,400
personally um have i smoked some really

3353
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:47,679
old hash before that was really

3354
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:50,960
enjoyable

3355
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:53,920
absolutely totally um i just

3356
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:55,359
feel like stuff has shifted in

3357
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:57,760
california

3358
01:58:55,359 --> 01:58:59,279
and i'm not saying it's better i'm not

3359
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:01,360
saying what we're doing now

3360
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:03,519
is better than you know this ancient

3361
01:59:01,359 --> 01:59:05,759
stuff that's been going on

3362
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:08,080
i just see it as an evolution i just see

3363
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:10,159
it as in it's it's come to this now and

3364
01:59:08,079 --> 01:59:13,599
it's gonna continue to change to it

3365
01:59:10,158 --> 01:59:16,000
um and me personally

3366
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:17,360
i don't see the freeze dryer leaving i

3367
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,399
don't see it like

3368
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:25,679
being a phase to me they're here to stay

3369
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:28,238
and uh to me uh

3370
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:30,000
with the freeze dryer it's really about

3371
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:31,919
preserving those terps

3372
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,599
you know it's really about working with

3373
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:35,440
fresh frozen material

3374
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:37,279
otherwise yeah you don't need one just

3375
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:39,039
air dry your hash and then like

3376
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:40,399
leave it out make bricks of it make

3377
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:42,719
temple balls

3378
01:59:40,399 --> 01:59:44,879
totally cool that's totally fine just to

3379
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:46,079
me it's a different pursuit than working

3380
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:47,440
with fresh frozen

3381
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:49,279
yeah fair enough and i think you're

3382
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:50,799
right there's definitely been a

3383
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:53,439
bifurcation of the scene

3384
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:55,520
where you know part of it um you know

3385
01:59:53,439 --> 01:59:58,879
generally people who

3386
01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:01,119
don't have access to the freeze dryers

3387
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:02,719
are still temple balling it up and you

3388
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:03,679
know i'm one of those people and i and i

3389
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:06,639
really like how

3390
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:07,840
temple balls evolve taste wise over time

3391
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:10,960
i certainly don't leave them at room

3392
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:12,400
temperature they're in a cooler

3393
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,319
but that's really great but then you

3394
02:00:12,399 --> 02:00:15,198
know when i go over to my buddy's place

3395
02:00:14,319 --> 02:00:17,439
who's got a

3396
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:19,039
a freeze dryer and we're having his you

3397
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:21,439
know you know beautiful

3398
02:00:19,039 --> 02:00:22,560
sandy stuff i'm like damn this is really

3399
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:24,719
freaking good too

3400
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:26,080
in a different way than the temple balls

3401
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:27,920
that i have at my house

3402
02:00:26,079 --> 02:00:30,079
and yeah and it's just and it's hey i i

3403
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:31,920
love adding colors to this palette of

3404
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:34,880
our relationship with hash

3405
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:36,560
and uh yeah and so um i think i think

3406
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:38,719
it's good

3407
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,000
to have lots of different products for

3408
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:42,719
us all to be able to enjoy what

3409
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,238
we want um your your comment about you

3410
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:46,319
know you're not really

3411
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:48,879
you know concerned about you know having

3412
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:49,599
your hash be 10 or 20 years vintage down

3413
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,000
the line

3414
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:52,639
but we do all need to to store our hash

3415
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,679
right

3416
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:58,400
um especially folks who work like like

3417
02:00:55,679 --> 02:01:00,480
uh like you do where you are seasonal

3418
02:00:58,399 --> 02:01:02,559
right you need to you need to grow your

3419
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:04,079
your plants during the summer and wash

3420
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,560
them during the winter

3421
02:01:04,079 --> 02:01:08,319
and then and then store it in a way that

3422
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:10,400
it's going to be good both for your head

3423
02:01:08,319 --> 02:01:13,599
stash but then also for providing

3424
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:16,238
for friends and so how do you

3425
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:17,599
store your hash material and i'm going

3426
02:01:16,238 --> 02:01:18,399
to give you two different threshold

3427
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:21,679
points

3428
02:01:18,399 --> 02:01:22,960
let's say the first threshold point is

3429
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:25,039
stuff that you're gonna

3430
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:26,480
smoke within like the next two weeks

3431
02:01:25,039 --> 02:01:28,800
right so it's like your

3432
02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:29,519
you know your your carry-around jar or

3433
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,279
whatever

3434
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:33,760
and then you've got stuff that's gonna

3435
02:01:31,279 --> 02:01:36,319
be in the freezer that you're gonna be

3436
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:37,440
you know keeping at that perfect uh

3437
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:40,079
consistency

3438
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:41,279
you know further than two weeks out so

3439
02:01:40,079 --> 02:01:44,079
tell us a little bit about how you

3440
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:44,079
handle your stuff

3441
02:01:45,118 --> 02:01:50,399
yeah to me um what i really love about

3442
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:54,158
my process

3443
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:56,638
is i just freeze all the melt

3444
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:57,920
out of my freeze dryer instantly i used

3445
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:00,239
to put it in jars

3446
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:02,319
um but as people know you know glass

3447
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:03,198
condensates when it comes out at room

3448
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:06,238
temperature

3449
02:02:03,198 --> 02:02:08,638
so if you've got hash in a glass jar

3450
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:10,319
and it's in your fridge or even freezer

3451
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:12,400
um and you bring it into room

3452
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:14,238
temperature do not open that jar right

3453
02:02:12,399 --> 02:02:16,158
away i'm sure most people on your show

3454
02:02:14,238 --> 02:02:17,439
listen and know this but for the people

3455
02:02:16,158 --> 02:02:19,598
that don't you don't

3456
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:21,359
open your jar right away you let it come

3457
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:23,679
to room temperature and you kind of

3458
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:25,118
wipe the sweat off it the condensation

3459
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:27,760
you know you don't want

3460
02:02:25,118 --> 02:02:28,319
the hash to absorb that moisture you

3461
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:30,800
know

3462
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:33,439
to me the whole idea of using a freeze

3463
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,279
dryer and drying hash properly is to get

3464
02:02:33,439 --> 02:02:37,039
the moisture out so then you don't want

3465
02:02:35,279 --> 02:02:38,880
to be reintroducing it

3466
02:02:37,039 --> 02:02:40,560
every time you're pulling your jar out

3467
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:43,199
your fridge or freezer

3468
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:43,840
so again me personally i stopped using

3469
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:46,960
jars

3470
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:47,760
to store my melt i just put it in

3471
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:50,639
parchment

3472
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,039
um uh there's brand out there it's

3473
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:54,400
called

3474
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:56,399
if you care um they make a parchment

3475
02:02:54,399 --> 02:02:56,719
sandwich bags they're these like you

3476
02:02:56,399 --> 02:02:59,118
know

3477
02:02:56,719 --> 02:03:00,000
sandwich size parchment bags it's what

3478
02:02:59,118 --> 02:03:02,479
they are

3479
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,158
personally me i fill those up with melt

3480
02:03:02,479 --> 02:03:06,559
and then i put them in ziploc

3481
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:07,439
freezer bags and i put them in my

3482
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:10,000
freezer

3483
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:11,118
that allows me to store a lot more hash

3484
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,158
in a small space

3485
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:16,799
than having just a bunch of random jars

3486
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:17,198
also then when i want it it's easier for

3487
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:20,719
me

3488
02:03:17,198 --> 02:03:21,519
to take i honestly keep all my melt in

3489
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:25,359
my freezer

3490
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:28,480
at all times if i want to smoke it

3491
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:30,960
i pull it out and personally just

3492
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:32,799
drop it on some parchment paper and i

3493
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,880
press up a little bit with my fingers to

3494
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:37,760
start smoking it but it stays

3495
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:38,960
in my freezer um you know when you pull

3496
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:40,880
that little bit out

3497
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:42,800
to enjoy you know sometimes i honestly

3498
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:44,639
always just keep it in my freezer i

3499
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:46,159
don't even pull it out into the room so

3500
02:03:44,639 --> 02:03:46,960
to let it allow it to get room

3501
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:48,559
temperature

3502
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:50,239
i feel like if you're just really quick

3503
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:52,800
with it you know there's not enough time

3504
02:03:50,238 --> 02:03:55,279
for moisture to really get in there

3505
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:56,159
but again i am keeping the melt in there

3506
02:03:55,279 --> 02:03:58,319
at all times

3507
02:03:56,158 --> 02:04:00,000
and what i love about that is i have

3508
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:02,719
melt in there from two years ago

3509
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
that looks exactly the same as the day

3510
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:06,960
as when i put it in there

3511
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,000
it is white sand and then now i'm able

3512
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:10,480
to make fresh

3513
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,719
pressed rosin and at my leisure you know

3514
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:15,279
if suddenly someone wants some rosin

3515
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:16,960
i just pull it out the freezer and i

3516
02:04:15,279 --> 02:04:19,439
load it into my little bags

3517
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:21,198
and make my rosin with it and then i

3518
02:04:19,439 --> 02:04:24,238
have my fresh pressed rosin

3519
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:26,000
um to me that fresh rosin should be

3520
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:29,279
stored in a wine cooler

3521
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,078
um 40 degrees ish that will keep that

3522
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:33,198
fine

3523
02:04:30,078 --> 02:04:37,198
um it should keep most rosins

3524
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:40,479
stable uh some or sorry i'm

3525
02:04:37,198 --> 02:04:41,678
most rosin that is stable will be fine

3526
02:04:40,479 --> 02:04:44,319
in a wine cooler

3527
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:45,920
that is all you need um some stuff

3528
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:48,078
that's a little less stable

3529
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:49,760
you may want to freeze it just to keep

3530
02:04:48,078 --> 02:04:52,960
it totally the same for

3531
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:55,840
long long storage but typically

3532
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:57,198
in my opinion rosin is fine um in a

3533
02:04:55,840 --> 02:05:00,319
refrigerator

3534
02:04:57,198 --> 02:05:02,559
melt in the freezer and then

3535
02:05:00,319 --> 02:05:03,519
once you cold cure the rosin at room

3536
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:05,520
temperature

3537
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:06,719
i then like to keep it back in the

3538
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:08,159
fridge um

3539
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:09,760
you know if it's just stuff that i'm

3540
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:10,638
smoking and enjoying over the next

3541
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,560
couple weeks

3542
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:14,639
it's totally fine to just keep your cold

3543
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,639
cured rosin on your coffee table you

3544
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:18,159
don't have to keep it in the fridge by

3545
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:20,000
any means

3546
02:05:18,158 --> 02:05:21,198
that's the beauty of the cold cure

3547
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,920
texture

3548
02:05:21,198 --> 02:05:24,799
is it will stay as that texture um the

3549
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:26,960
whole time

3550
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:28,800
whereas if you have that fresh pressed

3551
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:30,560
rosin on your coffee table

3552
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:32,480
it's gonna start to go through the

3553
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:34,000
changes which is nice that's what i like

3554
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:36,238
about fresh press and that's why i

3555
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
serve a lot of fresh press is because i

3556
02:05:36,238 --> 02:05:40,078
like to provide that experience where

3557
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,039
people can actually watch the texture

3558
02:05:40,078 --> 02:05:42,559
change for them

3559
02:05:41,039 --> 02:05:45,039
and then they can kind of make any

3560
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,960
consistency that they enjoy with it

3561
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:48,078
hell yeah well you know i think this

3562
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,319
brings us to our

3563
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:52,238
end there guilt thank you so much for

3566
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:56,400
i know we've been trying to put together

3567
02:05:54,319 --> 02:05:57,279
this interview for a few months been you

3568
02:05:56,399 --> 02:05:59,519
know it's the

3569
02:05:57,279 --> 02:06:01,198
it's the summer busy season for all of

3570
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:02,560
us so thank you for making the time for

3571
02:06:01,198 --> 02:06:04,000
us but then also

3572
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,719
thank you for sharing your vast

3573
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,560
experience on this topic because

3574
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:10,719
you know as as you said at the top of

3575
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:14,159
the show making quality

3576
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:17,039
hash is about addressing

3577
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:17,920
as many of these little variables as we

3578
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:20,560
can

3579
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:22,560
and as we continue to address more of

3580
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:25,840
these variables it just continually

3581
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:28,400
ups the game of our hash and as uh

3582
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:29,520
you know hash becomes a new american

3583
02:06:28,399 --> 02:06:31,759
pastime

3584
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:32,880
as uh as more homegrowers come into the

3585
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:35,280
scene um

3586
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:36,239
this you know these these best practices

3587
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:38,559
that you've developed will

3588
02:06:36,238 --> 02:06:40,158
will trickle throughout the scene so so

3589
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:45,360
thank you so much for your time

3590
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:47,279

um i really hope your vision

3598
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:01,678
of an america where everyone's making

3599
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:04,480
small batch

3600
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:05,520
concentrates at their home happens i

3601
02:07:04,479 --> 02:07:08,879
hope that's where

3602
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:11,760
cannabis evolves to i really hope

3603
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,078
legalization and normalization really

3604
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:14,000
just

3605
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:16,559
leads to everyone growing their own

3606
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:19,198
cannabis in their yard for themselves

3607
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:21,599
you don't need much room you know a few

3608
02:07:19,198 --> 02:07:23,598
plants goes a long way

3609
02:07:21,599 --> 02:07:25,920
that relationship that you'll have with

3610
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:26,960
the plant will be therapeutic unto

3611
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:29,679
itself

3612
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:31,279
that's my vision for future of cannabis

3613
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,039
you know it's not this

3614
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:35,039
crazy wreck world of all these

3615
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:37,039
corporations rolling in it

3616
02:07:35,039 --> 02:07:38,960
i really want to see just everyone

3617
02:07:37,039 --> 02:07:40,880
growing cannabis in their yard

3618
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:42,480
sharing it with their neighbors sharing

3619
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:44,800
it with their friends

3620
02:07:42,479 --> 02:07:46,078

3621
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:49,599
beautiful

3622
02:07:46,078 --> 02:07:52,158
right on so if you want to follow along

3623
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:54,480
on ganja gil the ice books adventures

3624
02:07:52,158 --> 02:07:56,638
you can follow him best on instagram and

3625
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:59,359
he's actually got two different

3626
02:07:56,639 --> 02:07:59,840
instagram feeds um you'll find that the

3627
02:07:59,359 --> 02:08:01,759
the

3628
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:03,520
the kind of content that he posts at

3629
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:05,280
either one are kind of different but

3630
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:08,719
you'll probably want to follow them both

3631
