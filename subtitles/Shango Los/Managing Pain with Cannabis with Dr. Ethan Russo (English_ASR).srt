00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:08,058
Hey Shango here I want to give a little

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,730
context real quick before we watch the

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:13,788
video you know this was recorded in a

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,618
log cabin Grange Hall here on Vashon

5
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:17,989
Island and it does not make for a very

6
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:21,379
good video recording the acoustics are

7
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:22,640
bad the the heating is loud and we have

8
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:24,528
to turn off the lights so people can see

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,509
the slides now now if you're there at

10
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:29,509
the Vimy a meeting it's awesome it's

11
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:31,730
very homey and intimate but it doesn't

12
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,710
really really very well two video

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,480
cameras so so I know this isn't as good

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,359
of quality as some of the other stuff

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,759
that that I share with you but you know

16
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,950
this is a pretty rare talk for Ethan

17
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,289
Rousseau to give nowadays so I figured

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,310
that getting what you can is better than

19
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:48,710
not getting at all and you know it

20
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,880
sounds good you know but there's a

21
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,799
there's a you know there's some high

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,150
loud points and then it gets quiet so

23
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:55,099
you might have to adjust your volume a

24
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:57,920
little bit but all in all it's it's a

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,870
great piece and it's you know serious

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,850
analytical information for people who

27
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:05,679
take their there's their pain management

28
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,680
serious so here you go enjoy

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,219
please welcome

30
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,530
to start out by showing you the names

31
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,530
option

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:02,270
otherwise it's kind of shimmer people

33
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,270
are gonna think that they're getting off

34
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:12,150
with rendition of cannabis and various

35
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:15,659
ancient languages to conceive starting

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,700
from the top just point out a couple the

37
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:23,789
fourth one is Chinese the kanji for MA

38
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:27,238
and that's actually a pictograph it is

39
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:29,699
showing stalks of the camp drying comes

40
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,439
that down in the shack so anywhere I'm

41
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:35,639
trying to better be recognized as

42
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:38,519
cannabis then next class is kind of poem

43
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,859
in Hebrew which means aerobatic cane

44
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,129
which was a component of the holy

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,800
anointing oil and then in the Greek the

46
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:51,799
more familiar cannabis

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:54,860
the accent on the first syllable this

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,600
talk is the same one that a gift to

49
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,480
physicians in scientists there will be

50
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:04,489
some technical stuff I will try to

51
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:07,519
explain but CP one is the receptor in

52
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,360
the brain where THC works we have

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,920
natural and doggedness chemicals within

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,820
that work on the same stuff

55
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:20,629
so this is a happy accident of nature so

56
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:23,419
the cb1 receptor is highly expressed in

57
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:26,870
areas of the brain that relate to pain

58
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:29,389
that's nociception and includes the

59
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,539
cerebellum the limbic system which is

60
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:35,779
involved with emotional type issues

61
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:38,509
basal ganglia with movement also reward

62
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:42,849
pathways that relate to whether a drug

63
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:45,469
is addictive or not now interestingly

64
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,620
there's some parallels between the way

65
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:50,569
that cannabinoids work on pain and the

66
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,230
way that opioids work on pain although

67
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:57,199
they're really distinct and their main

68
00:03:53,229 --> 00:04:00,079
differences is this the people reason

69
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:03,619
people die from heroin or other opioid

70
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,010
overdoses is because too much of it will

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,259
depress respiration it depresses an area

72
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:12,620
in the lower brainstem the medulla and

73
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:16,129
people quit breathing there is no amount

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,858
of THC or a cannabinoid that can do this

75
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:23,409
so there's no fatal overdose that's

76
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:27,829
possible with this kind of drug but the

77
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,939
endocannabinoid system in these natural

78
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,789
chemicals within this is not

79
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:36,000
brain it's throughout the body in the

80
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,819
gut it regulates things like how fast

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,920
things move and how much liquid there is

82
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:43,829
it's in the spinal cord

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,560
now that nerves in the body the

84
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:48,599
endocannabinoid system he has about 30

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,990
different roles but these were

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,970
summarized in 1998 by Professor de marzo

87
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,350
as relax eat sleep forget and protect

88
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,870
but it's involved in all these other

89
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,850
things pain memory whether you're gonna

90
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,819
vomit or not whether you're going to

91
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:11,010
have a seizure or not on how fast the

92
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:13,370
gut moves or how slowly it moves there

93
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,370
are

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,060
some of it is needed by the cb1 receptor

95
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,490
but there are a lot of other ways in

96
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,740
which this happens to some of her

97
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,620
relates to neurotransmitters those

98
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,810
chemical messengers in the brain there

99
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,389
are interactions as I mentioned with the

100
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,478
opioid system with gun an endogenous

101
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:39,360
system there so we've got a parallel

102
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:42,539
that morphine works in the same places

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:49,590
that natural chemicals called accounts

104
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:52,169
and endorphins work so what's the

105
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:56,000
mechanisms by which pain is produced

106
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:58,918
analgesia analgesia is pain reduction

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,610
this is endocannabinoid system he has a

108
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:05,490
baseline level of activity that's there

109
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,129
naturally if it's too low people are

110
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,689
going to have excess pain if the level

111
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,439
of things are high there's going to be

112
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,439
less pain

113
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:23,778
area to break all the periaqueductal

114
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,778
gray that's involved in a penetration

115
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:28,000
especially

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,110
also in here

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,519
balance we're cannabinoid it's like THC

118
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:40,699
or ten times more potent than opioids in

119
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:43,069
the nerves that make these relationships

120
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,990
and then it's also involved in the

121
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,620
spinal cord and this is responsible for

122
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:51,019
some associated phenomena pain that are

123
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:55,100
a little bit weird like hyperalgesia

124
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:59,379
that means that touch is perceived as

125
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,450
being really painful things like this

126
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:06,189
wind up where there's a buildup of these

127
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:09,379
pain mechanisms and these all relate to

128
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:12,560
mechanisms of inflammation as well and

129
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:15,589
things as simple as edge it is just a

130
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,699
mild form of neuropathic or nerve based

131
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:22,009
pain so what are the components of

132
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:32,719
cannabis we've mentioned THC the main

133
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:36,288
psychoactive component that works is the

134
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:41,410
non-intoxicating anti-inflammatory

135
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:43,240
component of cannabis but the rock

136
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:49,220
cannabinoids in the plant

137
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:58,819
tetrahydrocannabinol THC egg also has an

138
00:07:49,220 --> 00:08:01,160
effect and then an especially important

139
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,649
one is a terpenoid when the aromatic

140
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,510
components of cannabis call Kerry

141
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,659
awfully now this one's interesting

142
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:11,930
because it's also working on another

143
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,750
cannabinoid receptor called CB 2 that's

144
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,389
active up in the body and relation and

145
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,829
inflammation and pain but doesn't

146
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:23,389
produce any psychoactive effects so a

147
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:26,839
chemical I carry awfully and then just

148
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:32,870
works on CB 2 doesn't produce a high but

149
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:35,079
does have benefits on pain and then this

150
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,320
is designed to show you how things used

151
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,440
so this is of a preparation that was

152
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,750
made by Parke Davis on a pharmaceutical

153
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,410
company about a hundred years ago

154
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,778
one more and although it may be hard to

155
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:53,019
read the components are morphine

156
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:55,360
cannabis and capsicum where are Chili

157
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:58,028
Peppers yeah so you've got three

158
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,200
plant-based drugs that work on the

159
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:04,509
doggedness systems of being they didn't

160
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,810
know all these chemical relationships

161
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:10,450
but this is an example of what we call

162
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:12,750
empirical discovery that people tried

163
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,750
these things

164
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:23,828
what's interesting about this

165
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:26,559
preparation probably better than

166
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:28,028
anything we've got through conventional

167
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,699
means today

168
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:33,509
they probably gave this the people after

169
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:37,570
surgery didn't let them go home

170
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:40,028
but as long ago as the 19th century it

171
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,910
was known that cannabinoids produced

172
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:45,939
opiates sparing meaning that when he

173
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:48,490
gave cannabis people required less

174
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,500
morphine for being controlled and then

175
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,839
it could be used to help get people off

176
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,659
of those kinds of drugs because it

177
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,149
treated to withdrawal symptoms too so

178
00:09:55,659 --> 00:10:00,519
you may think this is a new finding but

179
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,708
we've known this for under 50 years it's

180
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:07,028
just that a lot of people would like you

181
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:10,629
to as I mentioned there are interactions

182
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:12,669
between cannabinoids and opioids teetsi

183
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:15,399
actually stimulates the production of

184
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:19,659
what's called beta endorphin that's one

185
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:23,649
of the natural chemicals within that has

186
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:27,399
an effect like morphine and it interacts

187
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:30,940
in this periaqueductal gray area the

188
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,070
opioid sparing I've mentioned but animal

189
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,029
studies that were done over a decade ago

190
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:39,519
also showed that when TC was present you

191
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:42,759
could prevent the development of

192
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,879
tolerance to the opioids tolerance means

193
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,549
you have to eventually give a higher and

194
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:51,689
higher dose to get the same level of

195
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:55,629
pain relief that that was necessary

196
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:58,300
previously it also produces a rekindling

197
00:10:55,629 --> 00:11:01,269
this means that if you give a dose of

198
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:05,169
morphine and it wears off it's no longer

199
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:07,419
good at reducing pain a little bit of

200
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:09,659
THC will bring it back to where is that

201
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:13,919
good again and this is a

202
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:16,289
the patient's observed to the scientists

203
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,919
Diana silhouettes that did all these

204
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:22,860
nice studies then yeah I met her in 1999

205
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:25,349
and told her gee you know this stuffy

206
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,240
reporting is fascinating but did you

207
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:31,259
know that they knew the same thing a

208
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,299
hundred and fifty years ago anyway she

209
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:40,169
was always surprised at the time we

210
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:42,419
became friends bit more about CBD some

211
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:45,569
very interesting studies these are again

212
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:50,099
rat studies they keep cannabidiol two

213
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:53,730
rats that were trained to pretzel ever

214
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,980
to get heroin this is your tax dollars

215
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,490
at work

216
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:01,110
but there were actual changes in

217
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,860
expression of neurotransmitters in the

218
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,919
brain in areas that relate to addiction

219
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,860
that CBD produced and reduce the

220
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,679
cravings such that the authors of the

221
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,409
study suggested that CBD should be used

222
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,889
as a treatment in humans for heroin

223
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:22,350
craving and to prevent relapse so some

224
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:26,159
wisdom there now this one's a little

225
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,840
complicated these were studies that were

226
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,350
done in Europe they had a series of

227
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:35,610
nations that sustained damage to an area

228
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,620
of the brain called the insula what

229
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,460
happened and it was a variety of

230
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,529
different things

231
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,990
some had damage due to car accidents

232
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:46,470
some from stroke some from other

233
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,110
diseases but what happened was some of

234
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,899
these people were cigarette smokers and

235
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:55,220
when they had this injury to the insula

236
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:58,350
they quit smoking with no craving

237
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,529
anybody's was addicted to background

238
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,680
knows this isn't normal but they figured

239
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:09,029
out that the insula was a very important

240
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:10,799
area in relation to craving related to

241
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:13,208
addiction and it wasn't just as

242
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,328
cigarettes the same thing was shown

243
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:26,258
for cocaine alcohol and opiates like

244
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:32,678
heroin turns out as I see here in the

245
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:35,438
skin a very large time depresses the

246
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:39,009
insula and that's the blue thing you see

247
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:42,159
here that's the area of the brain and

248
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:45,188
what was interesting was this change was

249
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:50,318
produced without any particular sedation

250
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:54,338
or other major side effects CPD alone is

251
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:58,659
non-sedating and then there are other

252
00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:03,279
mechanisms i've mentioned previously cb2

253
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:04,928
the non psychoactive receptor there's

254
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,318
been a lot of companies that have made

255
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:10,389
drugs that are selective for that that

256
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:13,118
hopefully would treat pain without

257
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:25,600
producing a high because that's what the

258
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:27,790
government likes what was important

259
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,199
about this was it reduced dopamine

260
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:37,298
release which is related to drugs that

261
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:39,998
tend to be addictive and rodents that

262
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:43,480
were trained to be addicted to cocaine

263
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:47,079
no longer would self administer in other

264
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:51,039
words it was a reduced addiction to

265
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:53,548
cocaine again carry awfully in this

266
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:57,458
natural component of cannabis is a

267
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:59,980
selective cb2 and in us to a drug that

268
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:02,649
works there and should do the same thing

269
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:06,058
so this is an area that needs to be

270
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:09,220
researched now an old study from the

271
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:12,188
1970s and basically what we see here is

272
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:16,329
there could be comparing the pain

273
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:20,169
relieving effects of codeine and TC this

274
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:24,698
is plane THC not cannabis to be like

275
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:27,159
marinol and basically 20 milligrams of

276
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:29,399
THC was the same as a hundred and twenty

277
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,828
milligrams of codeine

278
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:36,089
so take your choice be very high or be

279
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:36,088
very constipated

280
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:48,409
you just

281
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:57,040
roses on basically they showed

282
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:59,770
improvement these p-values are

283
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:03,199
statistical indications of how

284
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:05,539
significant of something has point no.2

285
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,440
means there would be a one two percent

286
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:12,519
chance that the result was spurious with

287
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,410
stood a chance and that's considered

288
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:19,250
significant however the problem was

289
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:22,360
anybody who's taken plane TV knows it's

290
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:25,429
not a very good job not very pleasant

291
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,460
two-thirds of the patients knew what

292
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:32,329
they've got this is an indication and

293
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,950
study was not blinded properly if people

294
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:38,720
can tell the difference between the drug

295
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:41,120
of the placebo excuse the result what

296
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,460
with a drug that psychoactive like plain

297
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,460
tea see clearly is it's a very hard

298
00:16:53,948 --> 00:17:02,678
neuropathy nerve based pain in patients

299
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:05,449
with hiv/aids now is a typical study

300
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:09,168
that the government approves we had to

301
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,909
use NIDA cannabis they required that it

302
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:13,159
be a limited number of patients for a

303
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:16,760
limited amount of time and that they all

304
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:18,799
have used cannabis before so that's not

305
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:22,908
all the population and you can't

306
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,828
generalize this to everything but I

307
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:29,960
guess they were worried that someone

308
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:32,750
would freak out be a problem for them it

309
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,690
was effective there was a reduction in

310
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:39,138
pain and about half of the patients had

311
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:42,440
a 30% reduction in their nerve based

312
00:17:39,138 --> 00:17:44,479
pain over the five days 30% is

313
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,919
considered highly significant to a

314
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,548
patient but there were a lot of side

315
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:55,990
effects as you can see in the table

316
00:17:51,548 --> 00:18:01,509
anxiety and 25% sedation over he have

317
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:04,849
disorientation 16 paranoia 13% confusion

318
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:07,569
17% this isn't the profile of a drug

319
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:10,609
that the FDA is ever going to approve

320
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:13,278
this is a problem with all smoked and

321
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:15,459
vaporize studies to date with one

322
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:15,460
exception

323
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:27,329
yeah the end of the space medicine

324
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:30,000
fda-approved or by that many botanical

325
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:31,889
drug me from a planet well there is this

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,869
blueprint for this

327
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:39,300
it was formalized in 2015 basically you

328
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:42,869
don't need to see the fine print you

329
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:46,079
need to show safety efficacy and

330
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:49,769
consistency in phase one two three

331
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,720
clinical trials phase one means you give

332
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:53,430
it to normal people to see how long it

333
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,309
lasts in the blood and what their

334
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:58,620
reactions are feast two is you give it

335
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,919
to a limited number of patients with the

336
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:05,129
disease in question phase three is large

337
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,980
numbers of patients and again with all

338
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,160
this the trail for the botanicals is

339
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,620
eventually you've got to show everything

340
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,110
that's it in it all the different

341
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:19,229
components and that they are within

342
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:25,740
tight tolerances there's not great

343
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:28,950
variance over time um one drug that has

344
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,309
done this is the drug that I worked on a

345
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:35,210
development of with GW Pharmaceuticals

346
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:38,549
called Sativex have been big some halls

347
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,559
this was made from two different chemo

348
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:43,529
bars chemical varieties that's the

349
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:47,460
proper term for strains we have strains

350
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:50,279
of bacteria and strains of virus viruses

351
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,350
but although everybody likes the meme

352
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:56,700
there are no strains of cannabis

353
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:59,429
there are cooler birds in any event it

354
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,470
was from a high THC King refer and a

355
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:04,410
high CBD king referred that were

356
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,500
combined to meet what is essentially a

357
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:10,320
teacher and a spray in the mouth what's

358
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,730
called the early kutzle administration

359
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,240
and each spray has 2.7 of THC and two

360
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:20,378
point five milligrams

361
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:25,419
of CBD along with interpreter and other

362
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:28,418
components this if you took enough to

363
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:33,009
feel it it would have onset about 15 to

364
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:36,490
45 minutes it's a little slower a lot

365
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:43,419
slower than smoking a little bit faster

366
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:45,278
than purely swallowing this is grown in

367
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:49,629
what they call glass houses in England

368
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:54,038
we call grain houses it's in organic

369
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:59,138
media they're all female clones from

370
00:20:54,038 --> 00:21:01,179
mother plants no fertilization it's all

371
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:04,599
tightly controlled as the temperature

372
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:06,929
humidity good bugs eat the bad bugs and

373
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:11,079
it's called integrated pest management

374
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:13,798
said no pesticides or anything else in

375
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:17,798
relation of pain there are a bunch of

376
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:22,089
studies that were done in neuropathic

377
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:24,009
pain pain associated with them mass etc

378
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:28,089
we'll share some of the studies and more

379
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:31,509
details however as I mentioned the

380
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:34,778
studies in the US have all been worth

381
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:38,288
NIDA cannabis of low potency very

382
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:41,888
limited duration if we pull all those

383
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:44,019
studies up until a few years ago with

384
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:47,048
smoked of vaporized cannabis it's a

385
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:51,009
total of 3 patient years so that would

386
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:54,898
be one patient smoking every day for

387
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:58,470
three years or it could be 300 nations

388
00:21:54,898 --> 00:22:02,469
anyway you can do it now it's not a lot

389
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:05,679
in comparison a few years back there

390
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:08,169
were 6,000 patient years with the sound

391
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:13,809
effects in a big slice just in pain

392
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:16,720
studies so a tremendous gap on my the

393
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:19,918
u.s. is allowed with domestics of

394
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,019
like versus what a British company did

395
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,710
including some studies in us patients in

396
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:29,079
other words you can't really have a

397
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:32,038
domestic source of cannabis and

398
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:35,949
development as medicine but you can

399
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,679
import it from a foreign country that's

400
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,440
how much sense that makes basically

401
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,230
receded this whole industry to foreign

402
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,509
companies and then explains but why I've

403
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:50,740
worked for foreign companies for most of

404
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:54,129
the last 23 years so let's go into some

405
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:57,250
specific studies these are are with sat

406
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,980
effects of spray in the mouth this was a

407
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:02,169
study that was done for what's called

408
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,069
peripheral neuropathy pain with

409
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:09,490
allodynia le dynein means that a touch

410
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:11,710
is perceived as a burning it's a

411
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,589
phenomenon associated with things like

412
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:18,490
diabetic neuropathy it could also happen

413
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:22,990
as a toxic reaction to certain drugs

414
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:27,599
like chemotherapy etc so 125 patients

415
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,599
over five weeks all the patients

416
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,280
Paul says could be antidepressants and

417
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,539
trying to treat a nerve pain but all the

418
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,000
patients that fail

419
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:42,190
still need something else and this was

420
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,650
just added on you see if you could get

421
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:50,350
any improvement over the baseline and

422
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,429
this is what happens so we're looking at

423
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:57,699
ten point scale zeros no pain ten is

424
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:59,860
being you can imagine and it may not

425
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:05,250
look like much but if you look at

426
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:08,740
placebo you've got a half of what box

427
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,660
improvement as compared to the big

428
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,839
circles and the blue is a point and a

429
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:19,029
half and again doesn't seem really

430
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:21,519
amazing but for a pooled population

431
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:25,990
that's a significant difference and you

432
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:30,509
see the p-value is 0.04 that means it be

433
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,509
only afford chances in a thousand

434
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,290
or

435
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:39,699
in terms of how much people improved

436
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:43,869
again let's look at the 30% improvement

437
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,539
highly significant of pages again a big

438
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:51,729
difference between placebo and the

439
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:52,899
purple and sativex in the blue in

440
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,870
allodynia

441
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:58,810
this phenomenon of touch feeling like

442
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:01,569
burning it's not something that is

443
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:05,950
treated effectively by conventional

444
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:11,379
drugs however it was this statistically

445
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:14,670
significant improvement with the big

446
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,230
some also sativex

447
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:20,590
patients global impression of changes

448
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:23,170
basically are you better are you worse

449
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:25,779
how much and you see that this is skewed

450
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:28,480
to the left meaning that the Blues are a

451
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:31,029
lot higher than the purple so the vast

452
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:37,319
majority of people were somewhere

453
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:37,319
between minimally and very much improved

454
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:44,559
now the same idea in multiple sclerosis

455
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,839
ms is not something that people who

456
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,220
don't have it usually associate with

457
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:53,919
pain however a lot of people with MS do

458
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,529
have what's called central neuropathic

459
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,930
pain central neuropathic pain from

460
00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:02,079
whatever cause it is extremely difficult

461
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:05,980
to treat rarely benefits from any

462
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:08,460
conventional medicine but there were 66

463
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:14,099
patients in this study for five weeks

464
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:17,250
again unimproved on the best medicine

465
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:21,109
conventionally applied

466
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:24,299
the same kind of thing once again

467
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:28,019
placebo you've got about a box and a

468
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:30,859
quarter improvement and about two and

469
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:33,930
three quarters on Sativex

470
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:38,399
five chances out of a thousand that this

471
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:42,360
is a spurious result that's about as

472
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:47,160
good as he get with this kind of study

473
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:49,259
and again the patient's global

474
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,279
impression of change is skewed towards

475
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:53,009
improvement

476
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,680
it was about four times more likely that

477
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:58,220
patients on and a big sum alt would

478
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,890
report improvement as compared to

479
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,920
patients with placebo

480
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:08,100
another study rheumatoid arthritis this

481
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:11,400
is the only study even though this is

482
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:15,779
old now has done almost fifteen years

483
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:18,720
ago it's the only study formal study of

484
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:23,549
a cannabis based medicine in rheumatoid

485
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:27,150
arthritis there were 58 patients the

486
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:30,240
design was a little bit weird the fellow

487
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,340
that did it said oh my patients are not

488
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,930
going to accept any side effects so they

489
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,990
decided they'd just give it at night

490
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:39,330
well this isn't a drug that lasts 24

491
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:42,029
hours so whatever you see here could

492
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:45,750
have been a lot better so they just gave

493
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:51,480
it a night up to six sprays for five

494
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:54,089
weeks and they looked at this two

495
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,390
different ways again by one measure

496
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:59,669
there was significant improvement box

497
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:02,880
and a half that's compared to a half a

498
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:07,019
box with placebo and this isn't pain in

499
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,240
the morning pain on movement

500
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:13,920
morning usually people that have this or

501
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,829
at the worst in the morning and then

502
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,670
they looked at a thing called the das 28

503
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:24,559
it's 28 questions that he asked patients

504
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:27,269
disease activity score drugs that

505
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,089
usually produce this kind of improvement

506
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:32,539
or what are called disease-modifying you

507
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:35,789
me see these advertised on TV they're

508
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:40,680
biologicals they cost thirty to fifty

509
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:43,879
thousand dollars a year and they have a

510
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:48,509
lot of potential nasty side effects like

511
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:53,180
creating tuberculosis when you didn't

512
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:53,180
have it before things like that

513
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:08,500
oh I am sorry to say if there's been no

514
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:10,720
follow-up on the study just because no

515
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,319
one picked it up and funded it

516
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,058
how about cancer pain they've been a

517
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,269
variety of studies with the same

518
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:24,039
preparation the first two studies phase

519
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:26,619
two studies were done in smaller groups

520
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:29,558
of patients the first study was done and

521
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:32,649
hospice patients in England and I

522
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:34,839
believe in Belgium and then the second

523
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:39,400
one was the larger number of patients

524
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:42,909
well we'll look at these so the two a

525
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,730
study was in a hospice population and so

526
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,370
these are patients that are already on

527
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:52,480
optimised opioids the highest dose that

528
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:55,750
they could use without terrible side

529
00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:00,039
effects but with remaining pain that was

530
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:02,650
still not at an acceptable level plus a

531
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:05,259
bunch of other drugs typically these

532
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,900
patients are on five drugs to try and

533
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:13,210
treat the pain and again they're using a

534
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:15,880
zero to ten numerical rating scale fix

535
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,870
involves Sativex showed a significant

536
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:26,500
improvement as compared to placebo

537
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:29,859
p-value of 0.1 414 chances out of a

538
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:33,549
thousand and i think called the

539
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:37,509
continuous response also has improved

540
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:40,869
over placebo and 30 percent response

541
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:44,509
rate was seen in 43 percent of patients

542
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:49,159
and a big smalls and only 21 percent

543
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:51,950
as many placebo now what a really key in

544
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,620
on this one in this study they were not

545
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:58,100
just using the big suppose there was

546
00:30:54,619 --> 00:31:03,709
placebo there was a high THC extract

547
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:06,109
with no CBD and there was the big small

548
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:09,620
source at effects the difference between

549
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:15,019
the high THC extract and sad events is

550
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:17,899
the presence of cannabidiol in Saturday

551
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:20,720
so if you look at the 30 percent level

552
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,900
the gray is the placebo response and

553
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,230
it's about the same as the response with

554
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:30,710
the high THC x-ray now compare that to

555
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:33,890
the orange which is the set of X THC and

556
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,500
CBD plus the other components and it was

557
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:40,759
statistically significantly better than

558
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:44,000
the two other preparations so this is

559
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:49,579
the first demonstration of the synergy

560
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:53,960
the additive effect on pain of having

561
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:56,869
multiple components or a whole cannabis

562
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:01,279
based medicine as compared to what would

563
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:04,909
have been primarily GNC alone so a

564
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,009
second face to study was done this is

565
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,740
what was called a dose range in studying

566
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:12,230
patients were instead of choosing their

567
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:16,058
own dose based on their response they

568
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,058
were placed within narrow

569
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:24,769
so the low dose was on one to four

570
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:29,870
sprays a day mid six to ten and high

571
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:35,720
range 11 to 16 now this did not go the

572
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:36,649
way it might expect sometimes less is

573
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,440
more

574
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:42,380
the high dose range turned out to be

575
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,558
poorly tolerated because of the degree

576
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:49,970
of side effects not a great surprise but

577
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:53,629
the efficacy was not there either what

578
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:56,660
was found was that group statistically

579
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:59,990
didn't show any improvement in pink so

580
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:03,440
that was left out and we'll look at the

581
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:06,169
low end and medium dose ranges and what

582
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,940
we see here is that any at any level

583
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:11,900
improvement there was this clear

584
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:16,570
difference between the placebo in the

585
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:23,450
gray and the low and medium doses of

586
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:25,909
sprays of Sativex in the green and if we

587
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,890
look at the two studies together again

588
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:30,950
there was a difference always a

589
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:34,549
difference a benefit of the real drug /

590
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:37,220
placebo again with statistical

591
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:41,470
significance as you see here are the

592
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,470
difference in the lengths of the bars Oh

593
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,819
then something an interesting was

594
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:50,808
happened something that the FDA will

595
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:52,369
totally ignore from the first study in

596
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:54,289
the hospice patients some of the

597
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:57,558
patients lived a lot longer than

598
00:33:54,289 --> 00:34:00,829
expected so they have what's called an

599
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:03,529
open label safety extension study this

600
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:06,230
means that everybody knew they were

601
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:12,739
getting sativex and they continued on it

602
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:17,389
and to see what happened so 10% of

603
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:19,689
patients took it for six months and 5%

604
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:23,269
for more than a year before sick

605
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:28,340
to the disease or stopping it for

606
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:30,710
whatever reason two things happen one

607
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:34,460
wasn't a great surprise to me and that

608
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:38,420
was that they didn't have to escalate

609
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:40,460
the doses of sad facts over time to get

610
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,380
the same level of pain relief now bear

611
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,929
in mind these are people dying from

612
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,630
cancer that isn't what you'd expect

613
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:50,960
you'd expect it'd be more drug but the

614
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:54,950
real surprise was what you always see an

615
00:34:50,960 --> 00:35:01,760
increase in opioid dose did not occur at

616
00:34:54,949 --> 00:35:05,359
all we're talking again on average so a

617
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:09,410
really expected thing graduated doses of

618
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:23,680
opioids in patients dying of cancer just

619
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:27,589
didn't happen but because this was a

620
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:29,000
couple of examples this is a patient

621
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,840
with multiple sclerosis

622
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,489
she had disabling pain on Saturdays she

623
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:39,890
was able to lower not only get

624
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:43,219
improvement in pain but reduced her dose

625
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:45,889
of amitriptyline an antidepressant used

626
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:48,739
to treat pain from a very high dose of

627
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:51,259
150 milligrams to 25 milligrams a day

628
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:52,689
and she was better enough that she

629
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:56,270
returned to full-time work

630
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:59,340
counseling other patients and these are

631
00:35:56,269 --> 00:36:02,849
patients I interfered and had permission

632
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:05,850
surely stories and pictures this is a

633
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,889
Dutch lady with sciatica although she

634
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:14,339
was Dutch she had never used cannabis

635
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:16,920
before she was on long-acting morphine

636
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:20,370
and this constant a high dose 180

637
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,619
milligrams reduced to 30 milligrams and

638
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:25,650
her pain diminished from 9 you're

639
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:32,460
appreciating dynamo 4 which is moderate

640
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:35,160
pain but tolerable now we're gonna go

641
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,769
through some other studies what I

642
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:42,599
haven't shown you is the results of the

643
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:44,969
phase 3 studies in cancer pain some of

644
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,409
these were done in the States but a

645
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:49,439
bunch of other countries around the

646
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:53,549
world now these three studies did not

647
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,289
read out so unfortunately the results

648
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,360
that were seen in the phase 2 studies

649
00:36:55,289 --> 00:37:00,690
were not demonstrated in the face three

650
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:03,240
studies normally would say well that

651
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:06,570
shows it didn't work wasn't effective

652
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:10,649
but that really wasn't the case we knew

653
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:13,019
this because it worked fine with

654
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:16,260
statistical significance in the American

655
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:19,469
nations it did not work in the patients

656
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,780
outside the US but there was a clear

657
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:25,949
difference in the patients and I can

658
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:28,980
tell you from having spent time going to

659
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:31,889
clinics in Romania and Poland that those

660
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,650
patients were sick as hell in those

661
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:37,739
countries you've got to be near death to

662
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:40,410
get opioid treatment to begin with and

663
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:44,099
if you feel that you're in really bad

664
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:46,319
shape and it was demonstrable that these

665
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:47,900
patients were a lot sicker often near

666
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,380
death and they just

667
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:57,079
didn't respond so it was a problem with

668
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:59,960
the mandated patient selection basically

669
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:02,298
the FDA was so worried that well maybe

670
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,480
giving this cannabis face medicine will

671
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:08,710
give people cancer that they would only

672
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:13,789
given to patients who already had cancer

673
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:17,420
again that's dollars at work okay

674
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:19,910
now shifting gears this is a really

675
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:24,289
important study that came out a few

676
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:27,828
years ago they looked at what happened

677
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:33,500
to rates of opioid associated mortality

678
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:37,720
people dying of overdoses what happened

679
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,719
as states legalized medical

680
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,539
what happened there essica the of the

681
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:48,319
Sophia epidemic and have been increasing

682
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:50,599
rates of deaths over time however the

683
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,059
rate of increase was much lower in the

684
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:55,849
states where access became available and

685
00:38:53,059 --> 00:39:00,409
the longer it was available the slower

686
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:02,119
of the rise was really significant

687
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:09,699
differences such that it was estimated

688
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:13,730
that 700 I'm sorry 1729 lives were saved

689
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:15,739
in 2010 and they said if the

690
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,280
relationship between medical cannabis

691
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:21,279
laws that opioid analgesic overdose

692
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,110
mortality is substantiated further word

693
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,750
enactment of laws to allow for the use

694
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:28,579
of medical cannabis may be advocated as

695
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,159
part of a comprehensive package of

696
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:34,699
policies to reduce the population risk

697
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:37,969
of opiate analgesics well it's been

698
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:40,639
another several years and everything

699
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:43,819
that's come out indicates the same thing

700
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:48,250
that when cannabis is available you see

701
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,250
fewer deaths due to opioid overdoses

702
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:57,400
some other studies very recent they

703
00:39:53,539 --> 00:40:01,210
looked at various studies animal

704
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,200
humans and they did what's called a

705
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,960
meta-analysis this is where you combine

706
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:10,219
studies and crunch the numbers to see

707
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,440
what the stats and basically 90 percent

708
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:15,759
of studies before giving the humans

709
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:22,130
showed this synergy boosting effect

710
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:25,880
combining cannabinoids and opioids the

711
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:30,130
effective dose 50 the dose at which 50%

712
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:34,640
of people will find efficacy on pain of

713
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:37,460
morphine with THC is much lower

714
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:40,759
highly statistically

715
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,500
and as they pointed out the studies like

716
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,160
the ones I showed you within the big

717
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:49,719
symbols are not powered to show hope you

718
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:53,299
experience in other words we didn't want

719
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:55,939
people could lower their dose if they

720
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:59,269
had to like they were super constipated

721
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,309
but it wasn't the idea was to try and

722
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:06,550
maintain what they'd taken previously

723
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:10,759
and see if Nixon moles made a difference

724
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:14,060
this is a study a hundred and nineteen

725
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:17,540
patients using cannabis sixty-four

726
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:19,338
percent reduction in opioids while at

727
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:22,190
the same time there was this big

728
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:25,460
improvement forty five percent quality

729
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:28,059
of life measures some of that could have

730
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:31,059
been due to fewer opioid related

731
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:31,059
side-effects

732
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:38,599
Stacy Gruber at Harvard did this study

733
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,400
where patients were looked before they

734
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:44,269
were on cannabis and three months after

735
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,030
using cannabis medicinally there was a

736
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:50,210
marked improvement in depression called

737
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:54,260
for the Beck Depression Inventory

738
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:56,900
better sleep better quality of life the

739
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:00,349
people who had been on opioids cut them

740
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:03,829
in half reduction of about forty eight

741
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:06,710
percent also benzodiazepines drugs for

742
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:10,909
anxiety that are highly addictive also

743
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:13,820
about 50 percent down additionally their

744
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:17,289
cognitive ability how they think their

745
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:22,099
memory was also significantly improved

746
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:25,309
again possibly due to having lower doses

747
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:29,750
of opioids so the idea that you're going

748
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:33,679
to take cannabis and be a zombie and

749
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,809
just not true then an experimental study

750
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,199
on normal

751
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:41,949
humans looking at pain combining

752
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:45,909
cannabis with oxycodone a synthetic

753
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:48,419
opioid should some of the same things

754
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:51,549
have been shown in the animal work that

755
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:54,490
when you had a dose of oxycodone that

756
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:59,670
was too low to reduce experimental pain

757
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:59,669
became effective with a very low dose of

758
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:23,079
t26 patients by using relatively low

759
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:28,600
dose of cannabis 26 grams of month so

760
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:31,719
that's like average one joint a day 46

761
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:34,329
percent reported increased ability to

762
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:42,579
work or return to work on there's a

763
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:45,090
significant opioid sparing so 20

764
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:48,130
patients reduced to 5 that required

765
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:52,530
opioids after treatment and the p-value

766
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:58,180
was 22000 you never see that it means

767
00:43:52,530 --> 00:44:00,700
that's real folks so but because there

768
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:02,409
was no placebo involved here the study

769
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:06,719
could have been done here and the FDA

770
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:06,719
would not accept it at all

771
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:12,400
another study done in Israel reported

772
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,360
this last year

773
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,680
Medical

774
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:23,329
large unselected population out of 344

775
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:27,139
patients a third run opioids 36% of

776
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:31,460
those could discontinue them nine almost

777
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:37,129
10% decrease their dose only 1% increase

778
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:46,159
and 51% were stable so again hope you

779
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:47,240
experience right this was it's really

780
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:52,759
unbelievable

781
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:55,250
for decades high doses and opioids have

782
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:58,910
been used for chronic non-cancer pain in

783
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:02,179
other words low back pain people with it

784
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:04,339
could be on opioids for years and was

785
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:06,879
never studied this way there was never a

786
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:09,500
long-term study to see if it worked

787
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:14,809
basically to boil down a bunch of stuff

788
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:17,360
they had 240 patients half were put on

789
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:20,599
an opioid Benjamin half on an honorable

790
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,490
beauty regimen after a year there was no

791
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,059
significant difference in the pain

792
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:28,849
mumbles Keenan intensity was actually

793
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:32,170
better than the people who are not on

794
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:35,299
opioids and as might not be a surprise

795
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:37,610
there were a lot more side effects in

796
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,010
the opioid group that was statistically

797
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:43,370
significant and basically what they

798
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:45,080
showed is that opioids don't work for

799
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:48,349
chronic non-cancer pain

800
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,769
what opioids should be use for is acute

801
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:54,799
pain you just had surgery or you were in

802
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:59,119
a car wreck or if you have cancer but if

803
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,630
you have a broken ankle and the pain

804
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:06,589
continues

805
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:12,140
so it's about time 20:18 that somebody

806
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:15,260
demonstrated this so what happens in a

807
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:20,119
situation where someone is addicted

808
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:23,330
dependent on opioids or they qualify as

809
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:30,289
having cannabis use disorder or whatever

810
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:31,969
that is cannabis can be used in

811
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:36,409
conjunction with no appearance as you've

812
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:40,669
seen even the people were dependent on

813
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:44,029
opioids but any close follow-up if

814
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:46,010
they're better after a while it is a

815
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:48,860
reasonable thing to try and reduce the

816
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,280
opioids and often patients do this on

817
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,860
their own

818
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:58,269
without a lot of instruction from

819
00:46:51,860 --> 00:47:01,730
doctors if someone has a high level of

820
00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:04,550
cannabis usage let's just say 10 grams a

821
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:07,760
day it's been demonstrated by my

822
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:10,760
colleague Dustin Sulak that they can be

823
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,360
reset citize does he call it what he has

824
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,090
to do is quit for the 48 hours and then

825
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:20,570
resume and half the prior dose and what

826
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:24,880
he's found is the efficacy on pain is

827
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:28,700
the same as it wasn't the higher dose so

828
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:32,840
much better to use less and get the same

829
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:35,480
effect so conclusions the

830
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:38,559
endocannabinoids system has a clinically

831
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:42,190
important role and mediation of pain

832
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:46,150
cannabis has a bunch

833
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:47,920
components especially THC CBD and some

834
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:54,269
of the terpenoids especially carry

835
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:58,000
awfully clinical trial success or

836
00:47:54,269 --> 00:48:00,369
benefit of the drug is very dependent on

837
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,829
the preparation so just because

838
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:05,739
something were something different may

839
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:08,590
or may not work it has to be proven on

840
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:10,869
its own we've got one cannabis based

841
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:14,079
medicine that's been proven in a variety

842
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:19,019
of clinical trials on the bits and balls

843
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,019
approved in 30 countries just not here

844
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:28,719
something I didn't show a lot of the

845
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:31,900
side effect profile adverse event

846
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:37,379
profile of the big samosas a lot less

847
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:42,670
frequent those reported with

848
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:49,150
particularly conventional drugs we know

849
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:52,150
that there's a horrendous level opioid

850
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:55,269
addiction with mortality in this country

851
00:48:52,150 --> 00:49:06,240
seventy seventy two thousand Americans

852
00:48:55,269 --> 00:49:06,239
died in 2017 but we need something

853
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,090
[Applause]

854
00:49:37,478 --> 00:49:46,429
yeah you know I can't quote your chapter

855
00:49:40,548 --> 00:49:52,759
now but it's their Center criteria if

856
00:49:46,429 --> 00:49:54,739
the generally to be rated this addictive

857
00:49:52,759 --> 00:49:56,958
never having to use disorder with

858
00:49:54,739 --> 00:50:00,079
indicate that you have a preoccupation

859
00:49:56,958 --> 00:50:02,478
at the drug in question Mike you think

860
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,739
about cannabis all the time where you

861
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:05,739
spend a good part of your day

862
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:46,008
if you ask me other people that yeah

863
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:50,748
however any number of things

864
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:52,219
however it's not going to kill them so

865
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:54,179
we need to look at it a little bit

866
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:58,440
differently and deal with

867
00:50:54,179 --> 00:51:00,629
I don't think there would be these kind

868
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,838
of problems if we have more balanced

869
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:07,380
preparations that he had a significant

870
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:11,058
amount of cannabidiol as well SDHC but

871
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:14,010
that's not what people generally ask for

872
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:18,778
we have an important question down here

873
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:21,589
about references for this material I'll

874
00:51:18,778 --> 00:51:24,179
just go ahead and email me most of the

875
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:26,788
material that are presented aside from

876
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:31,879
the most recent studies was in a book

877
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:31,880
chapter that came out a few years ago

878
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:53,519
yeah even one of your examples I'm not

879
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:56,250
sure we just slide it was but you bring

880
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,440
up an important point we know from

881
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:02,940
animal study so if we're looking at pure

882
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:05,010
cannabidiol that up to a point a higher

883
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,130
dose gives you better pain control and

884
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:10,109
then it falls off it's called a biphasic

885
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:13,170
effect we see this with a lot of

886
00:52:10,108 --> 00:52:16,949
cannabinoids it may surprise you to know

887
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:20,269
that TC we know that it reduces nausea

888
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:24,230
too high a dose that can produce much

889
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:26,690
but the trick with cannabidiol is when

890
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:29,269
it's a whole cannabis extract with a

891
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:33,070
terpenoid its present you don't get this

892
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:35,900
fall-off in the response to pain you get

893
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:39,769
no matter how high the dose is you

894
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:42,380
continue to get pain reduction so this

895
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:46,219
is really an important demonstration of

896
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:51,640
why we shouldn't be worried about using

897
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:55,368
isolates isolates are something that

898
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:58,579
better that the pharmaceutical industry

899
00:52:55,369 --> 00:53:02,570
model which is oh yeah we know what the

900
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:04,789
target is and we use one drug botanical

901
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:07,338
medicine is that exactly the opposite

902
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:09,619
it's the idea that gee we've got a bunch

903
00:53:07,338 --> 00:53:12,170
of components that act in concert and

904
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:15,680
produce an entourage effect and a better

905
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:19,940
benefit this experimental study done by

906
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:23,419
Rika Lele material showing this benefit

907
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:26,869
of having a whole cannabis extract that

908
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:29,450
CBD predominant preserves the pain

909
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:36,309
reducing effect rather than having it

910
00:53:29,449 --> 00:53:36,309
fall off with CBD alone yes yes

911
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:47,090
well the birds are important but there

912
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:52,550
is some doggie carry awfully and there

913
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:55,730
are other components the roots have been

914
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:59,119
used traditionally as long as on the

915
00:53:55,730 --> 00:54:01,369
tops have and they do have analgesic and

916
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:05,240
anti-inflammatory effects but they seem

917
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:07,760
to come from other components called

918
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:11,899
triterpene or it's free to land and

919
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:14,900
happy free dull and all and there are

920
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,000
few alkaloids not high concentration in

921
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:20,389
the roots whereas there none and the

922
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,409
tops the roots have gotten the attention

923
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:26,569
that they deserve and recently decades

924
00:54:23,409 --> 00:54:28,190
but a lot of people are making artisanal

925
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,539
preparations with the roots and

926
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:32,358
reporting good result

927
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:41,539
so yeah I'm wrote an article with

928
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:44,090
Natasha and if you want to learn more

929
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:46,070
about the canvas root ball we actually

930
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:48,350
interviewed Natasha R is about canvas

931
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:52,910
repel medicine on shaping fire podcast

932
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:57,108
last year another question Linda using

933
00:54:52,909 --> 00:55:00,289
the using the product for inflammatory

934
00:54:57,108 --> 00:55:01,549
problems how soon should you expect to

935
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:03,800
see some results

936
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:05,960
does it build up or is it pretty

937
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:10,010
immediate and why do they pick the

938
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,409
amount of time instead well yeah two

939
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:16,690
different things if we're talking about

940
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:18,858
pain depending on the the method

941
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:22,010
administration people may notice things

942
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:27,500
pretty quickly treating inflammation is

943
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:31,570
going to take longer and with a stable

944
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:33,739
pain condition we see Tennessee

945
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:38,210
improvement over time for a prolonged

946
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:41,479
interval in I didn't show all the safety

947
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:44,690
extension studies with sativex but

948
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,210
typically patients who are using it a

949
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:51,130
long time actually decrease the number

950
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:54,150
it sprays a day that they utilize

951
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:57,730
they need it less to treat their pain so

952
00:55:54,150 --> 00:56:00,130
there is a cumulative but in fact what

953
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:04,000
they choose from the studies depends on

954
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:06,940
what they think should happen and what

955
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,690
the powers that be will let them do okay

956
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:12,700
now part of the problem is a lot of the

957
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:15,329
pain studies that reported were done in

958
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:17,199
the prior decade and 5 weeks was enough

959
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:20,769
that isn't true

960
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:23,169
now most pain conditions the FDA will

961
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:26,920
say you have to treat for 12 weeks the

962
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:30,130
problem and that is we know from looking

963
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:33,369
at a bunch of studies that the longer

964
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:36,369
you treat the harder it is to show it a

965
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:39,909
benefit over placebo there's been a

966
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:44,199
marked increase in placebo effect over

967
00:56:39,909 --> 00:56:48,279
the last 30 years and it's worse for a

968
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:51,609
drug for treating pain any drug that

969
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,769
psychoactive or in the case of cannabis

970
00:56:51,610 --> 00:57:05,349
where the public thinks that this stuff

971
00:56:53,769 --> 00:57:08,259
is miraculous the way people think is

972
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:11,380
that jeez you know this is my last shot

973
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:14,680
I really hope this is going to work and

974
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:18,880
of course I must be on this drug I'm not

975
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:21,039
getting placebo and you know the way the

976
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,680
brain works it's a huge problem right

977
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:29,460
now in medicine because many drugs that

978
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:33,899
we know work don't work all that often

979
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:36,659
and something has set a dinner Soloff

980
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:40,230
sertraline the antidepressant commonly

981
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:43,338
used they did 26 studies to show three

982
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:43,338
where there was benefit

983
00:57:45,090 --> 00:58:01,130
always ask me but can you have annoyed

984
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:05,869
to Hamrick hyperemesis this is a

985
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:08,460
relatively new phenomenon described

986
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:10,670
there's several hundred case studies

987
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:13,829
reported but its more common than that

988
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:18,570
so this is a situation where it only

989
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:21,630
occurs in the context of people who use

990
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:25,860
very high amounts of cannabis on a

991
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:28,610
chronic basis only in that context and I

992
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:33,380
believe it's only in high THC

993
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:37,440
preparations what typically happens is

994
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:50,269
patient will develop terrible abdominal

995
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:53,730
pain the really characteristic thing is

996
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:57,639
they won't notice at some point that if

997
00:58:53,730 --> 00:59:00,730
they take a hot bath or spend five hours

998
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:00,730
[Music]

999
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:08,320
but the B end up in the air are they get

1000
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:12,789
expensive guests or intestinal workups

1001
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:15,010
they don't see anything and get you know

1002
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:18,880
given opioids or other drugs that don't

1003
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:22,060
work these solution that this is one of

1004
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:25,660
two things the obvious one is to stop

1005
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:29,049
cannabis and that takes care of it what

1006
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:32,679
is going on well nobody's sure but it

1007
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:34,570
probably is this biphasic effect that in

1008
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:36,730
certain air is the brain you're getting

1009
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:39,700
an opposite effect at what you expect

1010
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:42,010
from THC that is producing nausea and

1011
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:44,500
vomiting and producing pain rather than

1012
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:46,690
stopping it or I could have to do with

1013
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:49,659
the down-regulation of the receptors

1014
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:55,019
this is where they fold in in the cell

1015
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:55,019
membrane instead of being out there

1016
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:21,279
rub them on the abdomen it takes care of

1017
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:26,680
it I will relate my story it feels like

1018
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:29,440
it does it doesn't produce damage my

1019
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:33,068
theory is that capsaicin works on a

1020
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:35,559
receptor called trip v1 cannabidiol

1021
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:38,469
works on the same receptor without being

1022
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:41,740
burning so my theory was that you can

1023
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:47,139
prevent cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

1024
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:49,298
by having cannabidiol a few months ago

1025
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:52,058
at a conference I met a young lady who

1026
01:00:49,298 --> 01:00:55,179
had this problem we talked about it and

1027
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:58,780
I said well first you've got a cutback

1028
01:00:55,179 --> 01:01:01,358
or stop and then if you want to resume

1029
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:04,450
you need to be looking for type 2 or

1030
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:07,449
type 3 chemo first so those where

1031
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:10,868
they're equal amounts of CBD and THC or

1032
01:01:07,449 --> 01:01:13,389
even CBD predominant I'm happy to say

1033
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:16,059
that she was at the Emerald cup it

1034
01:01:13,389 --> 01:01:18,429
California a few weeks ago and she is

1035
01:01:16,059 --> 01:01:23,440
vastly better because she's using

1036
01:01:18,429 --> 01:01:26,159
cannabidiol so I think that is part of

1037
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,159
the solution

1038
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:42,108
Bernays regarding direct CVD versus THC

1039
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:47,809
can follow one missus semantics the

1040
01:01:42,108 --> 01:01:51,048
original camp CBD was made by a broad by

1041
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:53,930
using hemp refused in other words they

1042
01:01:51,048 --> 01:01:56,750
would use the seeds or fiber and then

1043
01:01:53,929 --> 01:01:59,690
the this refuse that was left was

1044
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:02,239
chemically extracted and they get a tiny

1045
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:06,950
amount of steeping be out of bed along

1046
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:13,098
with a bunch of garbage and that was FA

1047
01:02:06,949 --> 01:02:15,798
CBD I know that's not the way you should

1048
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:18,528
make medicine if you want cannabidiol

1049
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:21,079
that you properly come from dedicated

1050
01:02:18,528 --> 01:02:24,369
high cannabidiol plants and from the

1051
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:24,369
flowers that's where

1052
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:40,349
there are now plants with whatever ratio

1053
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:43,980
you'd want of high CBD usually low THC

1054
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:46,019
plus a good interpreter profile it's

1055
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:49,079
going to contribute to the therapeutic

1056
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:53,940
benefit of the preparation so I will

1057
01:02:49,079 --> 01:03:21,329
state clearly I'm biased but that's the

1058
01:02:53,940 --> 01:03:24,840
way to think it should be one more can't

1059
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:26,400
tell you you know these were they

1060
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:29,970
weren't looking and craving than the

1061
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:33,869
study wouldn't use this is an example of

1062
01:03:29,969 --> 01:03:37,259
what could happen if you use tight dose

1063
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:39,269
CBD to treat addiction okay so it's a

1064
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:41,670
good question but that wasn't what they

1065
01:03:39,269 --> 01:03:44,219
were looking at here how long the threat

1066
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:47,039
was I suspect they relate to the

1067
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:52,439
half-life of CBD so I'm gonna say

1068
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:54,599
several hours and you know that and we

1069
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:58,019
could find out experimentally when we

1070
01:03:54,599 --> 01:04:00,839
try this using kind of CBD to treat

1071
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:03,840
people with addiction we'll find out how

1072
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:06,120
long is it good for my suspicion is you

1073
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:09,630
should treat the people three times a

1074
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:11,279
day maybe even a little more you know I

1075
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:14,869
would depend on whether they take it

1076
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,870
orally or whether it's inhale
