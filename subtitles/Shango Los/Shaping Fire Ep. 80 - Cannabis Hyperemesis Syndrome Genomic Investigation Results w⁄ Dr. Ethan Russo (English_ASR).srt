2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,000
it annoys me so much when

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,759
prohibitionists try to tell me there is

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,919
something wrong with cannabis

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,359
i have to practice calmness in the face

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,960
of this idiocy

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,800
so you can imagine my frustration when

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
reports began being published

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,519
that some cannabis users were becoming

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,439
weak and nauseous with abdominal pain

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,759
and in need of hot showers because of

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
their heavy cannabis use

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,519
but then as someone who attracts

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,440
cannabis patients like i do i learned

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,320
that there really seemed to be something

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,399
going on

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,520
because of an increasing number of cases

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
being called

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,200
cannabis hyperemesis syndrome in the

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
community

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,719
yet i remain skeptical and curious

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,079
cannabis social media was apoplectic

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
about chs

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,960
and arguments about if it existed and if

25
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,759
it was caused by neem or eagle 20 or any

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,120
other additive were really common

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:01,519
this week lead author dr ethan russo has

28
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,238
released the first original research on

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
cannabis

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,560
hyperemesis syndrome and they have

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,840
discovered the genetic markers behind

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,840
chs an understanding of what triggers

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,400
the expression of those genetics is

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,840
vital and cannabis is clearly one of

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
them

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,560

on cannabis hyperemesis syndrome

102
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,800
welcome back to shaping fire ethan

103
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,158
thanks for having me

104
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,920
well you know let's start out by getting

105
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,318
a little bit of context while there's

106
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,079
been a lot of social media discussion

107
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,238
for what would become known as

108
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,239
cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome

109
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,080
in the last three years the original

110
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,878
index case that you know way before it

111
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,120
was named goes all the way back to

112
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:44,079
1996. how has interest in this syndrome

113
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,519
increased over these 25 years or so well

114
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
it has a great deal

115
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,319
there's been increasing recognition of

116
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,439
it so that diagnosis has become a little

117
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,560
bit better

118
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,639
although it still remains the case that

119
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,719
people that have it often have to go

120
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,679
through many hospitalizations

121
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:07,360
or er visits before it's identified

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,560
it is increasingly common in relation to

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,840
more potent material meaning that

124
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,079
cannabis being higher in

125
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,959
but overall it still would have to be

126
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
considered an

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,519
uncommon condition but one that is

128
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,519
important to recognize

129
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,840
that original case back in 1996

130
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,599
what about it made it stand out i mean

131
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,599
that's that's some time ago

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,840
uh what you know at the time did they

133
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,280
just say oh this person got really high

134
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,119
and and therefore

135
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,279
you know we're going to tie this to thc

136
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,399
or or was it not even originally tied to

137
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,758
thc

138
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,000
it was not um but basically this is in

139
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
australia and it was published along

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,360
with about eight other cases

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,240
only in 2004 so it was only

142
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,240
after a series of patients who were high

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,160
cannabis users and

144
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,400
were with close questioning that

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,000
the pattern was identified and

146
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,959
recognized

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,240
so over these 25 years or so what do you

148
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,239
think was the main

149
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,319
feature that caused the interest to

150
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,960
increase was it just simply

151
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,639
the increased use of cannabis and

152
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,839
therefore there were

153
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,038
um just statistically more cases of it

154
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,918
and so there was

155
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,399
more ability to look at it or was there

156
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,918
some

157
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:31,279
change in you know a scientific

158
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,560
policy or or a particular grant that

159
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,519
broke the right way like

160
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,000
like what has increased the interest in

161
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,599
it

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
where people are actually looking at it

163
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,720
now well it

164
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,600
it goes along with liberalization

165
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,000
of cannabis laws in many jurisdictions

166
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
but

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
most particularly with the increasing

168
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,560
availability

169
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,639
of high potency material such as in vape

170
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
pens and concentrates

171
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,360
so that's a factor but again there's the

172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,880
recognition factor

173
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,560
at all enters into the equation i see

174
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,120
multiple things happening at the same

175
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,759
time making for this opportunity to look

176
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,038
at it

177
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,080
sure right on so hyperamisa syndrome is

178
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,879
described

179
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,519
you know mostly by or at least up until

180
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,918
now

181
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,918
as a basket of symptoms a basket of

182
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,959
these common symptoms would you describe

183
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,079
them for us

184
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:27,359
yeah absolutely it's a very stereotyped

185
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:30,639
syndrome so what it includes are

186
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,319
cycles of severe nausea vomiting

187
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,560
and abdominal pain but they're

188
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,520
accompanied by a very

189
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,918
characteristic finding that is of the

190
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:43,359
patients who are afflicted with it

191
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,839
engaging in hot showers and bathing

192
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,639
uh almost in a compulsive fashion

193
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:52,198
sometimes hours a day

194
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,160
and so that is really what we call the

195
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,879
patho-mnemonic sign

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,520
the sign that clinches it when it's

197
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,598
combined with the other symptoms

198
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,959
so is it because what's interesting that

199
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,719
you would say hot showers so we're not

200
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,079
talking cold showers because they might

201
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,280
have a fever or something

202
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,560
they want hot showers does the does the

203
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,478
afflicted patient

204
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
know why they want to take hot showers i

205
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,918
mean what's what's their motivation why

206
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,879
do they think they want to go take a hot

207
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,478
shower

208
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:23,199
uh usually people are not aware

209
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,159
of the condition and that this is an

210
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
accoutrement

211
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,439
of it and they may just notice on a day

212
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,159
when they're having abdominal pain and

213
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,079
nausea

214
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,319
that the time they're in the shower they

215
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:38,079
feel better temporarily

216
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,280
and so you know humans notice patterns

217
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,758
and eventually they come to realize that

218
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,478
this is making them feel better and they

219
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,439
pursue it

220
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,120
sometimes hours a day and it's a

221
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,399
frequent occurrence that

222
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,680
the hot water runs out and then

223
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,758
eventually they

224
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,840
end up in the emergency room with an

225
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,720
extensive

226
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:03,279
evaluation when you say that um

227
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,919
that the syndrome has got stereotyped

228
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,758
syndrome

229
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,038
that sounds like the medical use of the

230
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
term stereotype because i didn't hear

231
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,478
you describing any kind of like stoner

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
stereotypes what does stereotype

233
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,959
symptoms mean

234
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,800
it means in this instance that you see

235
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,120
the same thing

236
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
throughout so if someone has this

237
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
syndrome they're going to have

238
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
all these features nausea vomiting

239
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,279
abdominal pain

240
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
and the hot shower behavior or bathing

241
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,239
behavior

242
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,680
i see in contrast say for example if we

243
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,519
were talking about lupus

244
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,639
where there yeah it's another basket of

245
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,278
symptoms but of the 30 symptoms somebody

246
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,598
might have their particular four or five

247
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,799
so instead of a mix and match pretty

248
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,640
much everybody has

249
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,039
most of these symptoms or if not all of

250
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,360
them that's exactly right the vast

251
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,079
majority of people are going to manifest

252
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,000
all of these four features um has

253
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
anybody died yet

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,278
yeah unfortunately there have been two

255
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,959
clear cases

256
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,958
on you know this was not related to

257
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,480
an overdose per se rather

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,759
they died of complications of the

259
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,080
vomiting uh if someone vomits repeatedly

260
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,439
eventually it's going to cause chemical

261
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,720
imbalances

262
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,519
uh problems with the electrolytes the

263
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,160
minerals in the blood and um there have

264
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
been two

265
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,278
documented uh cases of deaths and

266
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
question and a third and there may have

267
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,480
been others but uh there have been two

268
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,839
reported so so

269
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,039
let's look at the uh the symptoms uh in

270
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,839
a slight from a slightly different

271
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,159
perspective

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,360
so as we've talked about them so far

273
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,559
we've been talking about these

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,720
established stereotyped symptoms

275
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,239
um and we're looking we're able to look

276
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
at them in hindsight

277
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,560
can you give us a first person

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,480
perspective of the patient

279
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,759
and what they would experience like what

280
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
are the first ones to come

281
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,159
on and and how can a patient uh

282
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,159
delineate between these

283
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,679
and you know maybe like smoking while

284
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,519
they have the flu or something you know

285
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,000
like how how do they know when they

286
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,399
should be

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,839
like thinking about this right well

288
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,120
let's set up a sort of

289
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,240
archetypal patient um this presents in

290
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,078
phases

291
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,639
so uh cannabis hyperemesis or

292
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:23,838
hyperemesis syndrome is going to appear

293
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:27,199
in someone who uses cannabis and

294
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,560
usually it's going to be a high volume

295
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,879
user

296
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,799
most often of high potency material

297
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,159
meaning high in thc

298
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:39,838
and on a regular basis most often daily

299
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,559
or more than daily but the phases are

300
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,440
these

301
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,599
there's what's called a prodrome this

302
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,040
means an initial stage

303
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,759
where while people are using cannabis

304
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,078
they may develop nausea and vomiting

305
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,278
along with anxiety and some sweating

306
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,039
behavior

307
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,559
you know things that go along with

308
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,039
stress

309
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,239
the second phase is clearer this is

310
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,719
going to have the

311
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,839
hyperemesis along with the abdominal

312
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,360
pain and

313
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
the hot water water bathing and then the

314
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,039
third

315
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:16,240
is recovery which happens only following

316
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,000
abstinence basically as long as someone

317
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,959
continues to use cannabis

318
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,039
even in lower amounts they're usually

319
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,838
going to be at risk

320
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:29,439
for having episodic attacks of a similar

321
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,320
nature so when we're talking about the

322
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,200
volume of

323
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,000
thc um that is required and we'll talk

324
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
about some of the

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,759
the other you know requirements or what

326
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,159
we are seeing

327
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,200
along with the thc but specifically on

328
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,480
the thc

329
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
you're saying like high amounts and

330
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,200
you're saying that okay so we're seeing

331
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,160
more of this

332
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,320
as flowers getting uh stronger and we're

333
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,439
doing um concentration and

334
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,200
and high high thc

335
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,720
edibles does it matter

336
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
let's see how do i want to say this does

337
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,079
it matter if somebody smokes

338
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,120
a little low thc

339
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,439
flower every day versus somebody who

340
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
dabs on the weekends right like maybe

341
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,120
over the course of the week they're

342
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,479
going to get the same amount of thc

343
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,399
but in one time you're going to get it

344
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,920
all at once and then the and the other

345
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,200
person they're going to get a little bit

346
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,639
every day

347
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,320
i'm trying to understand the nature of

348
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,079
the threshold

349
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,079
yeah well that's going to vary with the

350
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,159
individual and unfortunately

351
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,359
when once the syndrome has become

352
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,480
established

353
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,240
the threshold is not very high um so

354
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,039
for example if someone's been in

355
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
remission after abstinence from cannabis

356
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,879
for a while

357
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,879
we find that they often will resume

358
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,639
pretty soon afterwards

359
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,039
not long and it usually goes along with

360
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,399
establishing again some degree of

361
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,639
tolerance

362
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,000
so when somebody begins to escalate

363
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,399
their dose

364
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,440
to achieve their desired level of high

365
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,639
um often they'll have a recurrence

366
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,040
so you know to mention your example this

367
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
could

368
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,278
occur in either context the low volume

369
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,000
user

370
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,639
during the week or the dabber during the

371
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,919
weekend

372
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,879
but i'm afraid there'd be no guarantees

373
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,958
and it's people can try to skirt the

374
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,159
edges of this but they're usually quite

375
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,039
unsuccessful

376
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,719
sure sure so and i can imagine that and

377
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,879
we'll talk a lot more about the the

378
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
genetic makeup of of these patients

379
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,320
during the second set but

380
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,240
i would think that at the top of that

381
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
list would be somebody who dabs every

382
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,720
day because

383
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
these are the people in our community

384
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,959
who are getting the highest amounts of

385
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,838
thc every day

386
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,439
quite true quite true so so how about um

387
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,639
with edibles as well

388
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,760
um you know we know that the the mode

389
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,198
of of using thc matters a lot for you

390
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,958
know a whole range

391
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:59,439
of you know body responses um

392
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,039
are people who are taking high levels of

393
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,720
thc from edibles having these

394
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,919
experiences as well

395
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,000
well they certainly may um in our survey

396
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,120
people had mixed methods of

397
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,919
administration

398
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:18,000
but most prevalent were either

399
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:21,120
smoking a flower or high potency

400
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,759
inhalation by whatever method

401
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,799
that was the most frequent but there's

402
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,000
nothing to say

403
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,359
that using an edible would prevent this

404
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,320
and in fact um it's going to be tough

405
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,600
for someone who's in the midst of

406
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,040
an episode of susceptibility to keep

407
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,000
material down and inedible

408
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,639
so you know the fact that this um this

409
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,679
research

410
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,440
it was done as a survey plus a

411
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,958
uh genetic um uh portion of it

412
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,279
um it's it's interesting because it kind

413
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,278
of shows two sides of of the coin on one

414
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,000
side you're asking people about their

415
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,720
use

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
and then on the second side you're

417
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,839
actually

418
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,519
you know running um you know taking a

419
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,320
look a short read of their genetics to

420
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,600
find out

421
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,639
what you can what you can find in common

422
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,879
um you know i would have i can't help

423
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,278
but have some amount of of awareness

424
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,958
that

425
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,039
people don't usually want to talk about

426
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,239
their cannabis use um because if it's

427
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,360
historically being

428
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,159
you know prohibited and taboo um would

429
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,600
you explain

430
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,120
how the survey functions um

431
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,879
because you know you and i have talked

432
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,000
off mic about this before and you know

433
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,600
you've got you've got a lot of good

434
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,720
feels and a lot of confidence and the

435
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,920
information that you're getting from

436
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,320
these surveys

437
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,039
um and and i think we'd all like to

438
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,440
understand

439
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,000
how that works when when the basis of

440
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,120
the survey is asking questions

441
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,320
yes sure well first of all this is all

442
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,919
anonymized um you know if you ask me who

443
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,320
was in it i couldn't tell you

444
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,439
except for a couple of people who have

445
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,639
told me themselves after the fact

446
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,079
so great pains were taken to

447
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,240
protect people's identities

448
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,000
especially in the instance of taking

449
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,879
their genetic material

450
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,799
uh it's a highly formalized procedure of

451
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:17,198
ensuring that

452
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:20,319
that infra information can't escape

453
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,799
so and this went the the other

454
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,920
layer of protection was that this went

455
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,278
through what's called an

456
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,159
institutional review board an ethics

457
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,198
committee

458
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,719
to ensure that there'd be no danger to

459
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:38,159
patients and that includes

460
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,839
being identified when they do not wish

461
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,000
to be

462
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,720
is it hard to communicate this safety

463
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,399
idea to people who are doing a study on

464
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,000
something that may even be illegal where

465
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,198
they live

466
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,759
um it sure has been in the past a little

467
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,599
bit less now with the liberalization of

468
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,480
laws but it remains an issue

469
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,560
absolutely i like actually your use of

470
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,000
the word liberalization of laws i hadn't

471
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,518
heard anybody use that before you know

472
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,959
people a lot of people use legalization

473
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
or normalization but

474
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,038
liberalization is is yet a different way

475
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,400
to put it which is which is not the

476
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,078
other two which i don't i don't think

477
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,519
the other two really fit are what we're

478
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,959
experiencing yet so

479
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,679
i like that i think i think i'll use

480
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,160
that myself so um

481
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,160
and and did you reach out to these

482
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,079
people because they were showing

483
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,759
symptoms and you reached out to them

484
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,119
through healthcare providers or did you

485
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,798
just put a you know a big

486
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,239
call out to everybody and people who

487
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,319
identified with the

488
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,480
with the nausea and the hot showers just

489
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,159
kind of like self-identified

490
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
yeah more the latter it was uh

491
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,160
systematized

492
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,519
um i sent this to various list serves

493
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,480
related to cannabis to physicians

494
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,400
who have an interest in cannabis we also

495
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,440
reached out

496
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,038
to emergency departments

497
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,038
and gastroenterologists and we contacted

498
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,558
people who had previously been authors

499
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:05,519
of studies of chs

500
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,079
and you know it's put on social media as

501
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,400
well

502
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,678
so there were a variety of methods of

503
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,960
outreach

504
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,280
but people could only come to it if they

505
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,840
self-identified

506
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,798
as being a venture being interested in

507
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,359
the study

508
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,279
random okay well i wanted i want to go

509
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,719
into the thc

510
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,879
survey aspect and the uh genetics

511
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,798
aspect in the same set so that we can

512
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,679
talk about all of that at once so let's

513
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,759
go ahead and

514
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,519
take our first short break and be right

515
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,359
back you are listening to shaping fire

516
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,639
and my guest today is neurologist and

517
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,389
cannabis researcher

518
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000

[Music]

520
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
over the years shaping fire has been

521
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,679
invited to sponsor several cannabis cups

522
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,679
and i've said no to them all

523
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,038
it wasn't until the autoflower cup that

524
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,759
i really wanted to help promote

525
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:51,519
something

526
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,000
and the producers sebastian and carla

527
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,000
didn't even invite me i approached them

528
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,079
i told them that autoflower cup was

529
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
important to me for three reasons

530
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,359
first it was obvious that they were

531
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,038
going for a friends and family vibe

532
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,319
instead of some sort of commodified

533
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,240
cannabis vibe

534
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,759
this event was going to gather really

535
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,919
cool folks

536
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,240
second the event had a ton of cool stuff

537
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,640
to do and to learn and to participate in

538
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,000
the event isn't just about cannabis it's

539
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,400
about living life fully

540
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,160
enjoying community eating together

541
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,960
laughing and listening to music

542
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,640
and mushrooms third and most important

543
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,519
to me personally the event was

544
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,520
authentically

545
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,359
for the autoflower community and the

546
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,759
autoflower community needs a place

547
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,439
too autoflower is about getting high

548
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,519
sure but i find that much of the

549
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,840
autoflower community is still focused on

550
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,720
cannabis patients

551
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,079
sharing best practices sharing seeds and

552
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,079
humility

553
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,839
these are the ideals that i share with

554
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,639
the event and i wanted to make sure i

555
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:51,279
did my part to help it succeed

will be legal

outside investment they continue to

647
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,519
refuse outside investment that would

648
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,240
change their company culture

649
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,079
oregon cbd grows tons of fresh food on

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,759
flour to patients as their company began

655
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,599
to succeed

656
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,519
seth and eric started donating money to

657
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,399

685
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,278
welcome back you are listening to

686
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,960
shaping fire i am your host shanglos and

687
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,400
our guest this week is neurologist and

688
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,079
cannabis researcher dr

689
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,278
ethan russo so let's dive into the first

690
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,918
half of this paper which is about

691
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,558
the survey about talking to cannabis

692
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,278
users

693
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,599
about their usage of cannabis generally

694
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,278
but

695
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,199
more specifically you're trying to tease

696
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,278
out thc

697
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,679
how did you go about asking the

698
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,079
questions ethan what were you trying to

699
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,919
pull

700
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:41,119
out of them and and after they answered

701
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,080
what did you see in the results sure

702
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,798
well it was a large series of questions

703
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,879
as

704
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,639
you've seen and will be evident in the

705
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,840
paper because we include

706
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,759
links to the entire survey both the

707
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:59,119
uh chs patients and the controls

708
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,158
uh so we went through simply saying have

709
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,038
you used cannabis

710
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,600
in the last year how often how much a

711
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,960
day

712
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:10,480
what type by what method

713
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,759
etc etc until we got the answers we

714
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,400
wanted

715
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:19,679
but we started out with 585

716
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,840
respondents of that

717
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,679
there were 205 patients who had the

718
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:27,519
constellation of symptoms of cannabinoid

719
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,600
hyperemesis syndrome

720
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:34,960
and carried a diagnosis so we were being

721
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,839
very careful about who we selected for

722
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,278
the study

723
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:42,079
we needed medical confirmation plus

724
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,480
ongoing symptoms so that's how you get

725
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,678
from

726
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,720
five eighty five to two hundred and five

727
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,440
of that group most were very high

728
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,079
frequency

729
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,600
users of cannabis ninety one percent

730
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:58,798
used daily or multiple times a day

731
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:02,399
and as we mentioned it was a high amount

732
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:05,918
cannabis flower concentrates the median

733
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,960
response was 4 grams a day of thc

734
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:13,320
predominant material

735
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,720
other features of the chs patients

736
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:19,599
15.6 percent carried a diagnosis of

737
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,919
either cannabis dependency or addiction

738
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:27,119
so that's much higher than you'd expect

739
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,400
in other populations and to corroborate

740
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,879
that

741
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,120
almost 57 percent had experienced

742
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,679
withdrawal symptoms from cannabis which

743
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,879
is all

744
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,600
also uncharacteristic um

745
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,000
now on the good side when people stopped

746
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,119
uh

747
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,440
like they might have gone to the

748
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,719
emergency room and told they had to stop

749
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,159
using cannabis 87.7

750
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,400
improved after they stopped but almost

751
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,840
all suffered a recurrence when they

752
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,759
resumed

753
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,199
now big problem in this study was

754
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,319
finding out

755
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,038
who do we compare these people to we

756
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,798
couldn't

757
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,640
just use normal people

758
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,879
who didn't use cannabis because who

759
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,520
wouldn't know if they had a

760
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,320
susceptibility

761
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,798
to developing cannabis hyperemesis

762
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:18,558
syndrome if they hadn't used it

763
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:21,839
in similar amounts so we found

764
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,839
control so-called

765
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,000
who were high-volume users of cannabis

766
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,759
but did not have chs

767
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,798
so we ended up with 54 of those

768
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,240
and in the survey information all of

769
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,398
them had used within

770
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,880
a year 70 were daily or more than daily

771
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:45,038
and again mostly by smoking thc

772
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,720
predominant material

773
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:52,240
now in contrast to the chs

774
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,319
patients only 3.7 had been

775
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,599
labeled as cannabis addicted or

776
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,558
dependent

777
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,879
and the vast majority 76 percent had

778
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,759
never had withdrawal symptoms

779
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,000
uh only 11 percent have been told that

780
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,440
they needed to stop cannabis for health

781
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,240
reasons

782
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,320
um so we felt that this was a good

783
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,679
comparison group

784
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:19,678
and uh so these two pools the 205

785
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,278
patients with chs that was confirmed

786
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,720
they had all the symptoms they had

787
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,440
ongoing symptoms

788
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,519
they had a diagnosis from a physician

789
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,919
and 54 controls

790
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,639
all of these people were offered the

791
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,720
option

792
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:38,399
of having their genomes tested

793
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:42,240
this is done by a swab in the mouth and

794
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:44,798
through the technology

795
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,200
that samples amplified so that we can

796
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:50,480
look at all the base pairs

797
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,480
um of the genetic sequence and see if

798
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,880
there are any unusual patterns

799
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,120
so that's how it was done now that

800
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,240
really whittled things down

801
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:03,918
although 99 patients

802
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,640
from the chs group agreed to get a test

803
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,640
kit only

804
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,679
28 returned it that seems especially low

805
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,919
yeah yeah well especially after they

806
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,759
were said they were willing to do it but

807
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,600
we actually had a little bit of

808
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:21,599
pushback uh from the chs community

809
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,158
uh there were people that questioned our

810
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,719
motives uh there were some people that

811
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,760
said

812
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,600
you shouldn't do this study um

813
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,278
and so it was very difficult it took us

814
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,240
a year

815
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,919
of recruitment to get our sample which

816
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,519
ended up being 28

817
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,600
chs patients and 12 controls

818
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,240
were people pushing back because it was

819
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:48,879
being sponsored by a private company

820
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,960
instead of an academic institution

821
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:56,720
uh well it could have been a factor

822
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,079
but let's make something clear and i i

823
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,200
don't know how to say this except

824
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,639
telling the truth

825
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:06,480
it's going to sound accusatory um

826
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,520
but people with chs tend to be very

827
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,000
uh suspicious um

828
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,119
and many uh people who have it don't

829
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,119
believe

830
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,239
that it's related to their cannabis

831
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,639
usage i mean

832
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,399
after all everyone knows that cannabis

833
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,360
is supposed to be good for nausea and

834
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,319
vomiting

835
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,719
so how could it be creating this problem

836
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,839
well

837
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,839
in fact thc is an antimatter

838
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,839
something that helps prevent vomiting

839
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,839
but it's also

840
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,079
subject to what's called a biphasic dose

841
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:40,319
response

842
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:43,519
what that means is at low doses thc

843
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,079
will prevent nausea and vomiting to some

844
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,038
degree

845
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,278
hopefully a lot but at high doses it

846
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,879
flips its activity and can be

847
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:54,798
pro-emetic meaning making vomiting more

848
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,799
likely

849
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,278
plus there are other considerations when

850
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,558
someone uses cannabis to this extent

851
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:05,359
they have tolerance part of tolerance is

852
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,319
that the cb1 receptors in the brain

853
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:10,158
where thc

854
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,558
works uh down regulate they sort of fold

855
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,880
in

856
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:17,119
it's the brain's way of saying saying

857
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,278
too much activity here we've got to turn

858
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,518
down the volume

859
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,119
so there are all these things that may

860
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,558
be coming into play

861
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:30,319
as well as the metabolism the breakdown

862
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:33,599
of of thc that

863
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:36,879
we had to consider on as we discuss

864
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:40,000
the results this will become more clear

865
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,679
so as um so you sent out these these 99

866
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,599
kits and and about you know ended up

867
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,120
buying about 25 percent of people

868
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:51,119
responded um did you um

869
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:53,199
did you see uh enough in the data

870
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,639
where you were able to get what you

871
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,919
wanted even though you got less

872
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,200
participation

873
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,640
uh we believe so i mean the the

874
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,080
proof of something medical is in the

875
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,399
statistics

876
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,158
so what we want to see to make something

877
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,518
statistically significant

878
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,559
is what's called a p-value probability

879
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,839
value of five percent or less what that

880
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,960
means is

881
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,398
that the results that are seen could

882
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,600
only happen by chance

883
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,879
one in 20 times or less and so we

884
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,398
achieved that

885
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,159
with several uh examples

886
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,759
obviously it would have been better to

887
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,039
have more patients but that

888
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:37,440
again proved very difficult uh wasn't

889
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,240
just the pushback from the community

890
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,720
there are a lot of people who don't want

891
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,880
their

892
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,480
chromosomes tested they've heard of

893
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,760
situations of

894
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,038
people getting arrested not because they

895
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,038
had their

896
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,798
genetic profile done but their cousin

897
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,359
did and somehow

898
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:56,879
law enforcement found their way to the

899
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,038
person in question

900
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,480
there have been some high profile cases

901
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,679
solved recently

902
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,798
related to this technology

903
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,798
all right well i can see that so so um

904
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:13,599
as far as a patient having hyperemesis

905
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,519
syndrome it seems like we're after

906
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,678
reading paper we're talking about uh

907
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,120
two things that have to both happen

908
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,720
number one

909
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:27,359
the the cannabis user uh

910
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,480
needs to have a high overall use of thc

911
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:33,599
which appears to be predominant daily

912
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,120
and that they're using more than um four

913
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,439
grams of high thc

914
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,879
material a day and of course while

915
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,679
that's a big swing between

916
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:47,519
four grams of flour versus four grams

917
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,759
of um oil one way or another

918
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,278
you're you're at a high level as far as

919
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,839
the the overall

920
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,759
um you know users in the united states

921
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,839
you know four grams of flour a day

922
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,119
wow well not necessarily incredibly high

923
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,199
for a lot of people i know

924
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,918
if we take the pool of all cannabis

925
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,038
viewers it's actually exceptionally high

926
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,639
it is and i i would emphasize that lower

927
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,759
levels of use could

928
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,960
also lead to problems in someone who's

929
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,119
susceptible

930
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,878
right but this will vary all right then

931
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,079
let's get to that susceptibility part so

932
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,078
the first part is

933
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,159
you take you you know more or less you

934
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,760
take in a lot of thc

935
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,159
but that has to be uh coordinated with

936
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,040
um someone's genetic predispos

937
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,240
disposition

938
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:34,719
and so this part of the paper um uh

939
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,279
you know to unraveling the genetic

940
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,799
makeup

941
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,480
um you know i can i can admit to the

942
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,800
fact that it's a bit over my head but

943
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,559
but luckily you break it down to

944
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,480
you know there's there's pretty much

945
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,679
five places

946
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,639
that popped up for you that showed

947
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,358
that some some correlation um would you

948
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,559
go through

949
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:57,199
as you know as you see fit the the five

950
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,559
sites and what you what you learned from

951
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,879
those sites

952
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,000
sure be happy to but let's start off

953
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,480
with one that

954
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,960
we suspected that didn't turn out to

955
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,679
have a pattern at least in the patients

956
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,880
that

957
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:11,559
that we examined so that would be a gene

958
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,960
called

959
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:17,358
cnr1 that's the gene that encodes the

960
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,960
cb1 receptor

961
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:24,799
so cb1 is where thc works and the

962
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,240
endogenous cannabinoids work

963
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,720
so this has been examined before in

964
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,598
relation to other disorders

965
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,239
um and what we're looking for is often

966
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,280
what are called

967
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:40,239
single nucleotide polymorphisms

968
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,920
this this is a way of saying that there

969
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:45,039
is a change in

970
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,400
one pair of

971
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:51,358
these base pairs in dna

972
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,240
so there's been some correlation of

973
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,920
mutations

974
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:59,039
on cnr1 the cb1 receptor gene

975
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,240
related to cannabis usage but we didn't

976
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,559
see that pattern

977
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,239
in the uh cannabinoid hyperemesis

978
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,358
syndrome patients

979
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,838
but um there's a

980
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:12,880
disorder that's sometimes confused with

981
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:16,239
chs called cvs

982
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,280
that's cyclic vomiting syndrome now this

983
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,799
is actually

984
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,040
different um this is often something

985
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,200
that appears in childhood

986
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,440
but may persist into adulthood and

987
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,078
people have episodes of

988
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,639
vomiting that come out of the blue it

989
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,720
seems to be related to a propensity

990
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:39,199
for migraine so sometimes it starts off

991
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,078
with a child who has episodic vomiting

992
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,639
without a headache

993
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,400
and it's only when they're older that

994
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:48,400
they get the headaches

995
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:52,079
now cvs cyclic vomiting syndromes

996
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,838
become more confused with chs because

997
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,480
in cvs people use cannabis to advantage

998
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:01,519
to treat than nausea and vomiting

999
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,119
but in cyclic vomiting syndrome there

1000
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,559
have been mutations

1001
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,880
in the cnr1 gene that have been observed

1002
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,759
so

1003
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,320
this is another point of distinction so

1004
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,040
i wanted to start there

1005
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
where we expected a finding but it

1006
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:20,639
wasn't there but it still is

1007
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,599
useful because we can differentiate this

1008
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,519
from cyclic vomiting syndrome got it it

1009
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,880
creates a nice point of contrast

1010
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:31,559
sure now what did we find

1011
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,358
well we'll start off with a gene called

1012
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:36,880
comt

1013
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:41,119
that is short for a mouthful catechol

1014
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:44,240
o methyl transferase comt

1015
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,320
is the gene that

1016
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:49,118
codes for an enzyme that breaks down

1017
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,519
catecholamines especially

1018
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,358
dopamine so these are neurotransmitters

1019
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:58,400
in the brain and elsewhere

1020
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:04,400
so what we saw was a mutation

1021
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:07,760
in the comt and this occurred in 57.1

1022
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,440
of the chs patients but only 10 percent

1023
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,079
of controls

1024
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,639
so that had what what's called a p-value

1025
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,320
of 0.012

1026
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:20,159
so that's well below the 0.05

1027
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,320
threshold that makes something

1028
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,118
statistically significant

1029
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,920
from a medical standpoint and it had

1030
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,838
what's called an

1031
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,358
odds ratio of 12 which is is quite

1032
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:37,599
wide as compared to the controls

1033
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:42,000
so what do we know about this mutation

1034
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:45,280
well when comt has a loss of function

1035
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,559
you have too much dopamine and an excess

1036
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,280
of that

1037
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,078
is associated with a number of different

1038
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,960
problems

1039
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,839
like compulsive behavior and that can be

1040
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,559
anything from

1041
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,679
substance abuse gambling even sex

1042
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,799
addiction

1043
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:03,519
uh have been related to this

1044
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,440
this specific mutation that we saw is

1045
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,440
called

1046
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,440
rs464

1047
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:15,838
46316 i'm sorry let me do that again

1048
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,839
rs 464

1049
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,078
um in prior studies this has been

1050
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,118
related to

1051
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,560
depression uh what's called rumination

1052
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,400
behavior where people

1053
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,000
can't get something out of their head

1054
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,880
they ruminate about it

1055
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,039
and also having heavy alcohol intake at

1056
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,760
a younger age

1057
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:38,159
and that is a feature in our survey that

1058
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,640
we saw in chs patients that

1059
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:44,159
a lot of them had problems with alcohol

1060
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,960
at one point in their life or not

1061
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,000
other mutations on this gene have been

1062
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,079
associated with

1063
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,559
impulsive behavior disinhibited behavior

1064
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,760
also some associations with attention

1065
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,880
deficit

1066
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,599
obsessive compulsive disorder and

1067
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,559
i'm afraid a tendency towards anxiety

1068
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:09,838
and even psychosis

1069
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:12,480
so it doesn't mean that somebody who has

1070
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,880
has all these things but we have seen

1071
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,199
similar problems

1072
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,079
in this population it means that they're

1073
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:22,719
more

1074
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:25,839
likely to have these kinds of problems

1075
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,078
but certainly this finding

1076
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,639
provides some insight into some of the

1077
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,079
things the epi phenomena

1078
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:36,239
the um features that we see in chs

1079
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,800
patients

1080
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,479
all right so uh is that is that complete

1081
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,039
on the c-o-m-t

1082
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,240
um is that as everything that we want to

1083
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,079
move on to the next one

1084
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,439
sure all right sure let's do that well

1085
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,119
the next one is one that

1086
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,240
that i predicted um one of the features

1087
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,720
of chs

1088
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,879
is one of the things that seems to help

1089
00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:00,559
of course is the heat

1090
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,599
also uh use of capsaicin ointment on the

1091
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,480
skin

1092
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,000
capsaicin is the caustic part of chili

1093
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,400
peppers

1094
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,920
some time ago it was noticed that when

1095
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,559
people had

1096
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,519
application of an ointment with a lot of

1097
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,719
capsaicin

1098
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:19,280
in it that it would reduce the nausea

1099
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,919
and vomiting at least temporarily

1100
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,839
so what the hot showers and the

1101
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,000
capsaicin have

1102
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:28,318
in common is that they're working

1103
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,599
through another receptor called the trip

1104
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:34,239
v1 receptor um

1105
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,000
and we saw a mutation there and that was

1106
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:40,159
something we predicted

1107
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,559
so 71.5 percent of the chs patients had

1108
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,838
this

1109
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:47,199
and only 30 percent in controls

1110
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:50,639
uh so that's a p-value of 0.015

1111
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:54,000
below the .05 threshold

1112
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:57,039
and an odds ratio of 5.8

1113
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,199
so this gene has been linked to

1114
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:04,318
anxiety and pain responses in the brain

1115
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:07,199
and it's also um

1116
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,719
has activity on areas of the brain that

1117
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,919
relate to

1118
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,480
how fast or slow your gut is moving on

1119
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,000
how much

1120
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,679
fluid is secreted so it has

1121
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:24,000
a definite tie-in to nauseum mechanisms

1122
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:27,919
um now as far as we know

1123
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,719
um so far the trip v1 mutations

1124
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,599
haven't been observed previously when

1125
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,598
it's

1126
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,280
we've looked at patients with cannabis

1127
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,720
dependency

1128
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,240
now our finding on this specific

1129
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,799
mutation

1130
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,959
may be a new one because it wasn't in

1131
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,359
the usual databases

1132
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,358
of genetic changes so this one is called

1133
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,280
rs879207

1134
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,960
but certainly the findings that we got

1135
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,800
suggest a linkage

1136
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,760
of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome to

1137
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,359
mood and gut disturbances as well as

1138
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,560
obviously the hot water

1139
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:12,400
uh bathing behavior um and it

1140
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:16,318
again goes along with the

1141
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,559
success of using capsaicin on the skin

1142
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,559
that trip v1 receptor is really

1143
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:24,078
important in this disorder

1144
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,880
is capsaicin a common input

1145
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,400
into topical lotions i i haven't

1146
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,599
personally come across it before though

1147
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,519
it could be very common

1148
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,119
when i heard that people were using that

1149
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,960
and they're like oh this works for me

1150
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,318
i'm like i would never have even tried

1151
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,280
that sure

1152
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,440
well you know it's funny because it

1153
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,560
burns when you put it on

1154
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,079
it's like chili peppers um i should

1155
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,358
point out though

1156
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,720
that um absorption of capsaicin

1157
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:56,239
orally is not very good um you know

1158
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:58,480
people have used uh have uh eaten

1159
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,838
thai food that was too hot sometimes

1160
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,240
it'll burn on the way in

1161
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,519
and on the way out it's not getting into

1162
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,358
the bloodstream

1163
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,199
but it does get in the bloodstream

1164
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:10,559
through the skin as can

1165
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:13,118
as opposed to cannabinoids um so we

1166
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,440
we know that you can get blood levels um

1167
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,000
this way

1168
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,200
interesting yeah that is interesting um

1169
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,559
is there anything else that you want to

1170
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:24,399
mention on this particular site uh

1171
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,318
no i think that's good for now we

1172
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,880
actually saw

1173
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,639
mutations in another area of the same

1174
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,039
gene but it didn't quite reach

1175
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,879
statistical significance

1176
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,880
um is it the kind of thing where you

1177
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,280
know you you highlighted it and you're

1178
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,440
and

1179
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,400
but and it's worthwhile to look later on

1180
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,400
or is it like

1181
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,160
oh yeah you do you want to tell us a

1182
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,000
little bit about it even though

1183
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,598
for this study it's not statistically

1184
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,280
significant uh sure

1185
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,119
you know it's something we're going to

1186
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,400
keep in the back of our minds

1187
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,599
as we get more people tested

1188
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,680
maybe it will achieve statistical

1189
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,119
significance at some point

1190
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:06,399
and certainly if if a person ends up

1191
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,119
having a mutation on two areas of the

1192
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,400
same gene

1193
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,400
it increases the likelihood that

1194
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,240
it isn't going to work properly and that

1195
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,838
they'll be attendant

1196
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,118
problems in other words disease

1197
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:22,400
manifestations

1198
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,160
right on um so what what is this other

1199
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,920
site

1200
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:27,838
oh it's just a different area of the

1201
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,838
same gene oh i see

1202
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,078
so so you just saw you just saw the

1203
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:34,159
correlation number was high

1204
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,200
but you didn't take it that next next

1205
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,838
level to figure out

1206
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,078
um what it might be doing there yet

1207
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,159
because the numbers were too low

1208
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,079
ah right i understand it's something to

1209
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,078
keep an eye on in the future

1210
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,839
all right well then what's our next site

1211
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,400
next one also makes some good

1212
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:56,799
sense this is the cyp2c9 gene

1213
00:45:52,400 --> 00:46:00,400
so this is a gene uh that

1214
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,599
it's in the cytochrome p450 series these

1215
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:07,760
are um enzymes that

1216
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:11,838
break down drugs and toxins in the liver

1217
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:15,839
okay as it turns out cyp2c9

1218
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:18,880
is the uh breakdown enzyme

1219
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:24,799
uh for thc

1220
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:27,280
and its first metabolite 11-hydroxy thc

1221
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,079
so if there's a problem with this gene

1222
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,560
it may mean

1223
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,960
that thc doesn't get broken down as

1224
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:36,719
readily

1225
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,440
so we we saw a mutation in the chs

1226
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:42,559
patients in 46.4 percent

1227
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,559
and only 10 percent of controls so the p

1228
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:45,400
value wasn't quite as dramatic but it

1229
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:49,599
was still

1230
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:53,200
0.043 which is below 0.05

1231
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,039
um so you know if we think about this

1232
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,598
conceptually

1233
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,199
if this enzyme is not as functional as

1234
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,838
it should be it could lead to

1235
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,799
accumulation of thc

1236
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,279
and get into that biphasic dose response

1237
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,160
where

1238
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,240
thc instead of becoming antiemetic

1239
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,960
becomes problematic

1240
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,719
uh or it's even possible because the

1241
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,358
enzyme isn't quite right

1242
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:18,480
that it's making a different metabolite

1243
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,558
than usual

1244
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,280
instead of 11-hydroxy thc it's possible

1245
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,200
probably unlikely but it's possible that

1246
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,160
it's making a different product that

1247
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,838
could

1248
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:35,199
uh have toxic effects

1249
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:37,119
now to help us out here

1250
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,439
just a couple of months ago there was a

1251
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:43,480
new study where a single patient

1252
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,679
got tested and they had two sites on

1253
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,800
cyp2c19 that were off

1254
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:51,039
that was a chs patient who

1255
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,680
was cannabis dependent and they they

1256
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,920
said had a personality disorder

1257
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,519
uh as well they didn't provide a lot of

1258
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,680
detail on that

1259
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:02,159
so this is something that's been seen at

1260
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:04,239
least one other time

1261
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,639
but our study was the first to look at

1262
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:11,118
it systematically

1263
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,519
the idea that um this uh cyp2c19 is

1264
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,880
where

1265
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,000
thc gets broken down um am i thinking

1266
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,480
about this correctly

1267
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,199
if i think we're to think of it as okay

1268
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,318
normally

1269
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,719
when we um use thc it

1270
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,400
is cleared from our body in you know

1271
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:29,118
three to four hours or at least from

1272
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,079
from the usable flow in three to four

1273
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,960
hours

1274
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,160
and so um with this site not working

1275
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,920
effectively

1276
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:41,358
um it would just simply either a

1277
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,599
break down the thc in longer

1278
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,519
than three or four hours so there's like

1279
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,480
a like almost like a half-life because

1280
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:51,599
you'd already be smoking your next smoke

1281
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:55,280
before it's it all your prior thc

1282
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:58,920
is processed or maybe it's and or

1283
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,920
um the thc is being broken down

1284
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,519
incorrectly not towards like body best

1285
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,838
practices if you will

1286
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:09,920
and and so it's actually kicking out um

1287
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,400
chemicals that are are not what you

1288
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,880
expect when you smoke thc

1289
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:20,000
yeah that's right um you had said cyp2c9

1290
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,200
this is actually cyp2c9 okay but i'm

1291
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,960
glad you mentioned that

1292
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:27,519
because um cyp2c19

1293
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,838
also breaks down thc it's just not the

1294
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,559
predominant enzyme that does

1295
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:34,000
and we did see changes there in a few

1296
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,160
patients but again

1297
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,199
not with statistical significance

1298
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:43,358
okay so by my account um

1299
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,960
we have hit either three or four sites

1300
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:46,239
so we've either got one or two left what

1301
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,639
is what's our next one

1302
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,318
yeah we've done three well we've talked

1303
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,799
about four but three that were

1304
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:55,838
statistically significant

1305
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,680
now the next one relates to the first

1306
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:01,199
one and that is

1307
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:01,759
this is drd2 this is the gene that codes

1308
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,879
for the

1309
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,720
d2 dopamine receptor

1310
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,119
again dopamine is a chemical messenger

1311
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:14,838
neurotransmitter in the brain

1312
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:18,200
and drd2 is the target of most

1313
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:21,199
antipsychotic drugs drugs used to treat

1314
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:21,199
schizophrenia

1315
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,000
and when there's a drug that stimulates

1316
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:31,200
this receptor

1317
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,679
it actually causes vomiting and affects

1318
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,879
the gut motility how fast the gut is

1319
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:37,919
moving

1320
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,960
so we saw mutation in drd2

1321
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,159
in 60.7 of the chs

1322
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,199
patients and only 20 percent of controls

1323
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:51,039
so the p-value on that was .031

1324
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,039
well below 0.05

1325
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,440
this same mutation which is on a thing

1326
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:59,759
called rs464

1327
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,760
8318 in prior studies

1328
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,440
is strongly associated with depression

1329
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,800
and anxiety

1330
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,000
those are features we see a lot in

1331
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,079
chs patients unfortunately

1332
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,920
also there have been associations of

1333
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,640
other mutations on this gene

1334
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,880
with nicotine addiction uh tourette

1335
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:22,879
syndrome and chronic pain

1336
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,800
and uh those are all well addiction and

1337
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,599
chronic pain were

1338
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,280
features that we saw in a number of the

1339
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,318
respondents

1340
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:36,000
um now i should point out that

1341
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:39,279
we have a mutation on drd2

1342
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,800
also on comt the the gene that breaks

1343
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,119
down dopamine

1344
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,559
so we've got sort of a double whammy

1345
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,838
here so to speak

1346
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,880
affecting dopamine metabolism and this

1347
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,159
may really help

1348
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,160
explain how cannabinoid hyperemesis

1349
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:57,358
syndrome is associated with nausea and

1350
00:51:54,159 --> 00:52:02,838
vomiting and some of these psychiatric

1351
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:04,880
problems that seem to appear in the same

1352
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:07,279
patients right

1353
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,240
so um it's interesting to see that this

1354
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,079
is the second

1355
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:11,838
site that we've talked about that's

1356
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,200
directly related

1357
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:17,358
to uh the dopamine system

1358
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,719
and so uh no doubt that's playing a

1359
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:22,880
significant role in

1360
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:25,919
in the the um

1361
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,559
syndrome yeah yeah and it also points

1362
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,760
out something else we know

1363
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,680
phenomenologically and that is that the

1364
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,040
drug haloperidol which is

1365
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:37,838
normally used to treat schizophrenia

1366
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:40,480
is more effective in treating the nausea

1367
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:44,480
and vomiting in chs patients

1368
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:47,440
than the more commonly used drugs more

1369
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,119
commonly used or uh things like on

1370
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,760
dansetron

1371
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,079
um and grenisatron that work through a

1372
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,480
different receptor they work very poorly

1373
00:52:54,079 --> 00:53:00,079
in chs patients

1374
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,920
now the problem is that haloperidol

1375
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,200
is a drug you don't want to be taking

1376
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,440
all the time

1377
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:09,279
um uh it has a lot of side effects it's

1378
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,838
extremely sedating

1379
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,800
uh can be associated with massive weight

1380
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:16,639
gain

1381
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,559
um and some really terrible long-term

1382
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:21,598
side effects

1383
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,319
possibility of developing diabetes

1384
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,720
or a movement disorder from the drug

1385
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:27,279
called

1386
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,959
tardive dyskinesia which is extremely

1387
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,760
difficult to treat

1388
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,400
so taking hilo peridol on a regular

1389
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,480
basis

1390
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,720
isn't uh something that people are going

1391
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,920
to want to do

1392
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:42,239
we have to look at better approaches

1393
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,639
all right i've got two uh two quick

1394
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,719
comments on vocabulary first of all

1395
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,159
um uh you know i don't know much about

1396
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,480
the drug dance-a-tron but

1397
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,598
i love the name dance tron it sounds

1398
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,519
like a video

1399
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,800
on dance-a-tron oh all right well it's

1400
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:56,719
still it's still pretty good

1401
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,160
it's got a playful ring to it still but

1402
00:53:56,719 --> 00:53:59,519
more importantly so

1403
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:01,279
you know from a moment ago i was

1404
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,039
searching for the word syndrome right

1405
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,839
and i kept on wanting to come up with

1406
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,480
disease when used you know as a medical

1407
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,599
term

1408
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,358
what does this word syndrome

1409
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:16,720
a syndrome is a pattern of

1410
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:17,598
problems that leads to a diagnosis a

1411
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:20,399
disease

1412
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,960
is due to one cause whereas a syndrome

1413
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,318
may have

1414
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,800
multiple different causes okay so

1415
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:29,358
actually we'll use a misnomer we talk

1416
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,680
about parkinson disease

1417
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:33,598
it's not really a disease because

1418
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,159
there's more than one cause

1419
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,480
it should be called parkinson's syndrome

1420
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,399
because

1421
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,039
when you lose a certain number of

1422
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,240
neurons related to the dopamine system

1423
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,960
again

1424
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,679
um in the brain that can come from any

1425
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,960
cause

1426
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:54,000
aging strokes toxins

1427
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,159
when you have killed off 90

1428
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,920
of those cells you have a parkinson's

1429
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,318
syndrome

1430
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,599
so a disease would be more like strep

1431
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:05,519
throat

1432
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:08,400
a disorder caused by streptococcus

1433
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,639
but unfortunately these terms are used

1434
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:14,000
somewhat interchangeably and

1435
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:17,598
um you know but a syndrome is a

1436
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,039
pattern of symptoms or signs that leads

1437
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,280
to a diagnosis

1438
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:23,279
okay thanks thanks for doing that so so

1439
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,440
what's the the the fifth and final

1440
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,280
um site we're going to talk about here

1441
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,559
yeah well this one

1442
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,280
is a little harder to explain um and

1443
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,680
this is on

1444
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:38,960
something called abc a1 that's the atp

1445
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:43,118
binding cassette transporter this

1446
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:47,199
gene affects cholesterol and other

1447
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:49,838
lipid metabolism

1448
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,399
it's most important in that it's related

1449
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:54,480
to alzheimer's disease

1450
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,680
and in that disorder there's an

1451
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,240
accumulation

1452
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:03,919
of abnormal uh proteins

1453
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:06,159
in the brain and we'll get to how that

1454
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,559
relates here if we can

1455
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:13,838
so we saw a mutation uh in abc a1

1456
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,400
that was present in 67.9 of the

1457
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:18,798
cannabinoid hyperemesis patients

1458
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,720
and only 20 percent of control so that

1459
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:25,759
was a p-value of 0.012

1460
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:29,118
well below the 0.05 threshold

1461
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,960
now additionally this is a homozygous

1462
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,760
mutation meaning that

1463
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,119
you know we have two sets of of each

1464
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,160
chromosome

1465
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,838
and it appeared in both um it wasn't

1466
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:44,558
just on one it was on

1467
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:48,239
both so unfortunately because

1468
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:51,680
this gene mutation appeared in both

1469
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:54,399
um chromosomes in affected patients

1470
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,000
it could imply an increased risk of the

1471
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,358
development of dementia

1472
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,400
memory loss later in life

1473
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:05,440
and additionally it could

1474
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,400
lead to risk factors for coronary artery

1475
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,159
disease

1476
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,519
heart attacks and the development of

1477
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,519
type 2 diabetes

1478
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:18,480
and uh not this specific mutation

1479
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:21,679
but another mutation on a closely

1480
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,679
related gene abcb1

1481
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:27,838
uh were associated with cannabis

1482
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,838
dependency in another study

1483
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:33,599
so you know but we certainly see

1484
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:36,159
a higher degree of cannabis dependency

1485
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:39,519
in the chs patients

1486
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:42,798
than we could explain by chance so

1487
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:46,159
when you got the results and you saw

1488
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:48,079
these five sites um

1489
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,358
there was a lot of correlation and then

1490
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,440
there were the there was

1491
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:54,798
uh the other one that didn't have quite

1492
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,599
enough uh significant correlation

1493
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:58,318
was your initial response like hot damn

1494
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,559
there's five

1495
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,639
sites we have something here or we're

1496
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,160
like oh we're really hoping for ten this

1497
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,159
isn't a lot or like anything

1498
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,399
more than one you know as somebody who

1499
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,318
is you know i don't do your job so

1500
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,440
i don't know whether or not getting five

1501
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,558
hits like this

1502
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:18,000
is like like wildly successful

1503
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:21,440
or or regular or low

1504
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,239
um i was excited i think we really have

1505
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,200
something here

1506
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:27,519
we have um several genes that help

1507
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:32,318
explain the phenomenology

1508
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:35,440
of chs um now i should emphasize

1509
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:36,079
um i don't know that any of the patients

1510
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,119
had all

1511
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:42,480
five mutations but

1512
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,318
often they'd have combinations of of one

1513
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,679
or several

1514
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:49,599
and what we're looking at again is a

1515
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:52,798
susceptibility factor

1516
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:54,960
we hope that we can use this as a

1517
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:58,719
screening device

1518
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,000
as it is now someone who has this

1519
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,318
constellation of

1520
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,480
symptoms ends up with a lot of

1521
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:07,519
hospitalizations

1522
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,798
and emergency department visits on

1523
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:12,400
and that is very invasive and expensive

1524
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:15,358
there have been two quotes in the

1525
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,838
literature of how much people have spent

1526
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:19,759
before they've gotten a diagnosis and

1527
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:22,400
it's ranged between

1528
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,680
twenty six thousand dollars and ninety

1529
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,960
six thousand dollars

1530
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:28,558
wow um and that was then the ninety six

1531
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,960
thousand dollars was

1532
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,240
some years ago i guarantee those costs

1533
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,280
would be higher

1534
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:38,558
now if this is not recognized

1535
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:41,839
so it's our hope that in the future

1536
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:43,920
if a patient comes to the er and the

1537
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:45,199
doctor there is wondering about this

1538
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,200
they may want to do this

1539
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:52,078
test and see if there's a

1540
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,358
susceptibility there especially if

1541
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:58,960
they've previously

1542
00:59:53,358 --> 01:00:02,480
had tests cat scans mris

1543
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,358
upper gi lower gi um these tests are

1544
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,159
almost always

1545
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:07,679
negative um they're expensive they can

1546
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,239
be invasive

1547
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:10,879
um we're hoping that this is going to

1548
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,639
lead to

1549
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,880
better identification and saving people

1550
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:20,159
time and money as well as pain

1551
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,160
yeah definitely that um before i move us

1552
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,279
off the sites do you have anything that

1553
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,118
you want to say on

1554
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,559
on any of these sites before i move to

1555
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,960
the next the next set oh i think we're

1556
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,119
good

1557
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,199
all right so so let's talk about so far

1558
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,559
during this set we have talked about

1559
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:38,318
you know the the two primary you know

1560
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,160
folks who are in this dance the first

1561
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:43,039
being high thc

1562
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:45,440
and then and then second being um

1563
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,679
showing mutations on these sites

1564
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,200
and you know as somebody who's been in

1565
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,879
the scene for a long time

1566
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,480
and and have had friends who have

1567
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,200
experienced these these

1568
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,000
um symptoms um and i've seen them

1569
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:57,439
firsthand there's

1570
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,199
there's a lot of us who have

1571
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,559
participated in really

1572
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:02,960
ugly threads on social media about what

1573
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,079
was

1574
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,798
causing um these symptoms

1575
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,599
and then you know eventually being

1576
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:13,199
called

1577
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:17,359
chs two of those

1578
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:19,439
um are neem which is a crushed up seed

1579
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:22,639
used as a fertilizer and

1580
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,318
to some a pest discouragement

1581
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:26,798
and then and then other people were

1582
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:29,838
making suggestions that it's clearly

1583
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:33,358
eagle 20 a classically banned

1584
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:36,000
cannabis pesticide and the defense of

1585
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:37,679
you know it being one or two or both of

1586
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
these were just like off the charts to

1587
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:39,519
see

1588
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,719
people get so angry with each other

1589
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,159
about bro science is really

1590
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,318
disheartening

1591
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,598
um so you know we've got to address

1592
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,159
these ethan so

1593
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,798
so what can you tell us about neem and

1594
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,759
what can

1595
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:53,199
you tell us about it pesticides as their

1596
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,319
you know ability to

1597
01:01:53,199 --> 01:02:00,078
be causes for chs

1598
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,719
well they are not um i have been a great

1599
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,960
critic

1600
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:05,358
of pesticide use in cannabis i've

1601
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,039
published about this before

1602
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:09,199
and it would have been nice if that were

1603
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:13,280
the answer but it's not

1604
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:16,558
um as someone who had the misfortune

1605
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:18,319
of treating patients with pesticide

1606
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,720
exposure i can tell you

1607
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:22,798
that it's a totally different situation

1608
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:26,078
to chs

1609
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:26,880
and as someone who uses organic neem on

1610
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:31,839
my

1611
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:34,798
fruit and berries it doesn't fit either

1612
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:35,119
the symptoms do not match up at all and

1613
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:37,440
they

1614
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,798
certainly are not producing genetic

1615
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,519
mutations

1616
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:43,679
at this level it is the case that some

1617
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:48,480
pesticides could

1618
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:51,519
mess with a person's dna but um i

1619
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:54,240
i'm afraid that that is

1620
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:56,400
just uh delusional to think that that's

1621
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:59,759
the cause of this syndrome

1622
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:03,680
um a couple of other examples uh

1623
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:05,760
again this syndrome chs was first

1624
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:10,078
described in 2004

1625
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:13,200
at that time it was not the degree of

1626
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,519
pesticide usage in cannabis culture that

1627
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,358
there

1628
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:21,280
is today so that doesn't make sense

1629
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:24,239
additionally chs has been encountered

1630
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,839
unfortunately with some synthetic

1631
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:28,719
cannabinoids as well

1632
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,358
where although they certainly can be

1633
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:30,879
toxic

1634
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:33,199
there's no reason to think that there

1635
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:37,519
would be pesticides or neem

1636
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:40,399
in those uh so that's just one of those

1637
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:41,519
theories that doesn't hold water so

1638
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,920
ethan the the

1639
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:44,719
the assertion that you made that uh

1640
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,838
there were

1641
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:48,558
less pesticides being used in 2004 than

1642
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:50,558
there are now

1643
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,680
like that jumps up to me like a red flag

1644
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,359
so i'm curious

1645
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,519
if you would break that thought out to

1646
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:57,598
me because you know as far as

1647
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:58,639
most of us chat we most of us say you

1648
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,880
know back in the day

1649
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,838
people would put you know any kind of

1650
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,599
evil pesticide on their stuff so that

1651
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:07,199
they could get it out through you know

1652
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,599
the black market and they

1653
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,639
and people didn't know their customer as

1654
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,400
often

1655
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:14,719
and because they were you know they're

1656
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,680
shipping it places or they were you know

1657
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:19,118
putting it downstream whereas nowadays

1658
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:21,279
people are more aware

1659
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,119
of the pesticides being unhealthy and

1660
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,160
more people are looking for pesticide

1661
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:27,200
free stuff

1662
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,960
that's my assumption right um

1663
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,719
what what what's in your head that gives

1664
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,400
you the idea that they were used more in

1665
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,719
2004

1666
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,480
um well it's based on what i've heard

1667
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:40,399
from testing labs

1668
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:42,880
um now again the sophistication in

1669
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,480
identifying these compounds is greater

1670
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,200
uh than it was

1671
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,440
i i think that this is a phenomenon

1672
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:53,199
that's gone through peaks and valleys

1673
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:56,400
yeah um so you know i

1674
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:58,239
i couldn't give you the the statistics

1675
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,599
in any given year

1676
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:04,078
um but suffice it to say that

1677
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:06,160
pesticides and neem are not the cause of

1678
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,240
cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

1679
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:09,279
right that part i get well all right

1680
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,439
great so

1681
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,119
um all right so let's wrap up this set

1682
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,679
when we come back and um

1683
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,440
to set three we're gonna talk about um

1684
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:18,399
you know a handful of questions that

1685
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,720
don't have

1686
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,079
um you know easy categories but for now

1687
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,239
let's go ahead and and

1688
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,160
take our break you are listening to

1689
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:28,639
shaping fire and my guest today is

1690
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,139
neurologist and cannabis researcher dr

1691
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:32,318
ethan russo

1692

[Music]

1693
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:35,358
while i love growing under the sun

1694
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,079
there's a lot of good reasons to grow

1695
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:37,920
indoors

1696
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,760
and if you're like most folks you want a

1697
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,760
lighting source that grows high yielding

1698
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,520
healthy plants without using excessive

1699
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,520
amounts of electricity

1700
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:46,639
bios lighting creates biological

1701
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:48,318
lighting solutions

1702
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:50,879
that brings the natural brilliance of

1703
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:52,880
the outdoors into your grow room

1704
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,559
bios lighting has the attributes that i

1705
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,519
look for in a horticultural lighting

1706
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,359
solution

1707
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:58,960
i've bought those cheap lights online

1708
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,318
and they're difficult to work with and

1709
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,280
fail in no time

1710
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:05,358
in contrast my bios led light is

1711
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,559
industrial grade to last a long time

1712
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:10,159
it is ip66 wet rated so little foliar

1713
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,920
overspray won't harm it

1714
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:13,920
it is easy to clean without taking it

1715
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,559
down and of course the most important

1716
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,960
aspect

1717
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,440
is built for the exact light spectrum i

1718
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,240
want for great yielding healthy cannabis

1719
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,519
plants

1720
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:23,759
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

1721
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:26,000
rigs look badass too

1722
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,599
many horticultural led lighting systems

1723
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,159
are based on irrelevant performance

1724
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,838
metrics

1725
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:32,000
and people love to argue online about

1726
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:34,318
these numbers i prefer to judge on

1727
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,199
par photon efficiency and how happy my

1728
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:36,880
plants are

1729
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:39,279
and the bios lights exceed my

1730
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,519
expectations in these categories

1731
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,920
bios lights have an optimized broad

1732
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:44,960
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis

1733
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,798
and plant growth

1734
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,798
while also providing the ideal

1735
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,639
conditions for superior par

1736
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:53,038
efficacy and a comfortable visual

1737
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:55,838
experience i also love their attentive

1738
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:58,079
and over-educated customer service folks

1739
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,000
bios starts with a team of biologists

1740
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,079
before getting the electrical engineers

1741
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,519
involved they have studied how light

1742
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,599
impacts cannabis plants

1743
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,759

1798
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,838
as cannabis regulations become more

1799
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,559
demanding and consumers become more

1800

educated

1801
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,080
it is increasingly important to avoid

1802
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,759
the use of chemical pesticides when

1803
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:57,439
cultivating cannabis

1804
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,279
beneficial insects have been used for

1805
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,879
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and

ornamental plant industry

01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,880
and today many cannabis cultivators are

1808
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:07,919
moving from sprays and chemicals

1809
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,920
to beneficial insects covert biological

and cannabis researcher

1849
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,158
dr ethan russo so ethan you know one of

1850
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,158
the things that the paper

1851
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,519
points out that you know i i really

1852
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:37,599
identified with was

1853
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,840
the paper said that uh in general people

1854
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,760
waited a long time to get help

1855
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,880
and while i'm certainly the kind of man

1856
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,039
who's willing to

1857
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,039
ask for directions when i'm driving my

1858
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:47,840
car and i'm not afraid to go to the

1859
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,079
doctors

1860
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,039
it all just sounds like you know a pain

1861
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,319
in the ass

1862
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:57,920
um to have to go but at the same time

1863
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:59,039
these symptoms are severe and the sooner

1864
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,760
you go

1865
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,319
the better you know your likelihood for

1866
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,440
treatment

1867
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:09,198
is so um can you kind of talk to

1868
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:11,759
both both the psychological aspect of

1869
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,799
you know people resisting going to a

1870
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,159
doctor about something

1871
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:20,000
but also more specifically

1872
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:22,000
what you saw as the line in the sand

1873
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,760
for these patients of when they had had

1874
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,880
enough

1875
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:29,280
well i i think it often is uh required

1876
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,239
the intervention of a family member or

1877
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,679
friend

1878
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:35,439
um quite frankly um

1879
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,359
for some of these patients they'll spend

1880
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:38,879
all day in the shower as long as the hot

1881
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,799
water lasts

1882
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,520
um it really can come down to that

1883
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,400
unfortunately

1884
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,239
plus there's the factor that some of

1885
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:50,960
them have already been told that

1886
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:53,279
uh this is likely related to cannabis

1887
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,640
usage and it's not a message that's well

1888
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:56,960
received

1889
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:00,079
and then there's the whole factor of

1890
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:02,319
legality or illegality

1891
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,920
you know we on the west coast are more

1892
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:07,039
accustomed to

1893
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,640
cannabis being legal but that's not true

1894
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:12,000
everywhere at all

1895
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:15,440
and there's still a stigma attached

1896
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,158
no matter how you look at it yeah i buy

1897
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:19,439
that and

1898
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:21,519
and for for most of us who use cannabis

1899
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:22,559
um you know even though i consider it

1900
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,080
all medical

1901
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,239
most people think about it either

1902
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,640
medical or recreational

1903
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,158
but but the medical care system is not

1904
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,199
necessarily our friend

1905
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:34,399
either of us and um and no one wants to

1906
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:35,919
go to the hospital to be

1907
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,679
you know treated like an addict or

1908
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,239
something you know exactly

1909
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,880
yeah so so let's talk about the

1910
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:44,399
treatment

1911
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,800
so um you know if

1912
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:47,839
the paper makes it sound very cut and

1913
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,119
dry

1914
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:53,440
that the only treatment apparently is

1915
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:55,359
stopping using cannabis for a while is

1916
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:58,399
it that cut and dry

1917
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:01,759
well it is if we're talking about uh

1918
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:05,119
eliminating the problem yes um

1919
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,199
now that doesn't preclude the idea that

1920
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,238
we may develop approaches that are going

1921
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:11,678
to reduce

1922
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:12,718
or mitigate symptoms but we don't have

1923
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,880
anything like that

1924
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,600
now you can't cover your body in

1925
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:21,279
capsaicin cream

1926
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:24,159
as a regular treatment

1927
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:26,000
so you know at this point we have

1928
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:30,960
signals from our results

1929
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,600
uh places to point for possibilities

1930
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,319
you know we know that haloperidol works

1931
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,000
better than

1932
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:40,799
other antimatters um

1933
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,560
there is another drug a prepatin that's

1934
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,880
been used in one patient

1935
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,120
it works on a different area in the

1936
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,359
brain

1937
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:52,238
you know one of the things to wonder

1938
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:55,279
about is could the

1939
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:59,119
problem be attacked by something from

1940
01:13:55,279 --> 01:14:00,719
cannabis other than thc and that's

1941
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:03,439
really possible

1942
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,439
say for example when whenever you take

1943
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,479
your thc make sure you take some

1944
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:11,198
cbn with it or something like that um

1945
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,158
no i'm afraid that isn't gonna work um

1946
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:15,439
seemingly

1947
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:18,799
any exposure to thc is a risk factor

1948
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:22,158
for someone who has chs um

1949
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:24,320
again there may be a certain threshold

1950
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,879
and we we find people are trying to

1951
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:30,479
skirt that threshold all the time

1952
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:33,679
but when an attack hits it's too late

1953
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:36,879
um you know again there's an

1954
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:40,158
extremely high relapse rate uh

1955
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:43,359
with this syndrome once it's established

1956
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:46,158
um and uh i i we

1957
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:48,719
have to recommend or someone in my

1958
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:52,319
position as a physician has to recommend

1959
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:54,399
abstinence from thc exposure

1960
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,599
is it more like a tolerance break or i

1961
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:58,399
mean like is it is it

1962
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,280
you know you should stop using thc

1963
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:02,158
forever ever

1964
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,920
or is it i at all so it's not like oh

1965
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:05,679
you're a daily dabber

1966
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,359
you need to go down to joints only

1967
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:09,600
something like that again i wouldn't

1968
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:11,439
rule out the possibility that there is a

1969
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,719
low-level threshold but

1970
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:14,639
people are not going to be able to

1971
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,679
resume their prior uh

1972
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,679
intake levels i see that's clear yeah

1973
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,399
and this is very individualized medicine

1974
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,079
so none

1975
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:24,238
none these are generalities really

1976
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:26,238
depending on the susceptibility of each

1977
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:28,000
person you use the term attack

1978
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:30,799
you said when they have an attack i had

1979
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,520
not really considered it as an attack so

1980
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,119
is do they come on like an episode where

1981
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,040
you're not feeling it okay will you

1982
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,359
describe an episode

1983
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:41,279
well i again i could start with this pro

1984
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:44,399
drum of nausea and vomiting

1985
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:48,158
um or low level nausea and then progress

1986
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:49,920
to a full-blown um episode with nausea

1987
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:51,599
vomiting abdominal pain

1988
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,039
and over the course of a day or is this

1989
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,320
like over the course of a week

1990
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:58,719
it again it can vary but um

1991
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,880
often there may be weeks or even months

1992
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:04,560
of the pro drone before

1993
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:07,199
uh full-blown attacks so we've we've got

1994
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,000
you know the possibility that changes in

1995
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:10,238
usage

1996
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,679
could be helpful we've got a possibility

1997
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:13,519
that um

1998
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,600
you know some of this pharmaceuticals

1999
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,719
might be useful but but really the long

2000
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,000
and the short of it is

2001
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:22,560
is once you're diagnosed with chs

2002
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,679
what is actually called for is cessation

2003
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,320
of thc

2004
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,119
sure yeah now again there may be other

2005
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:32,319
adjunctive approaches that are helpful

2006
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:35,840
um we're trying to look at whether

2007
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:38,158
lifestyle factors enter in

2008
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,679
you know whether they're dietary changes

2009
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:43,599
that could be helpful

2010
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:45,679
anti-inflammatory diets more

2011
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,719
healthy healthy diets fruits and

2012
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,719
vegetables

2013
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,880
that's unclear at this point but that

2014
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:54,960
would be possible

2015
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:58,319
could uh aerobic activity or meditation

2016
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:00,800
or any of these other things be helpful

2017
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:04,399
you know we're at a stage where these

2018
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:07,279
are avenues that need to be explored

2019
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:09,519
but i wouldn't have any hard and fast

2020
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:13,119
suggestions aside from thc

2021
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,760
avoidance the study mentions a couple

2022
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:15,679
times

2023
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,600
the particular patients that exhibited

2024
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:20,880
withdrawal symptoms

2025
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,880
and most folks don't consider

2026
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,800
cannabis addictive therefore it's not

2027
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,199
really going to have withdrawal symptoms

2028
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,520
and

2029
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:28,479
and i understand that like for a patient

2030
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,920
who is using

2031
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:34,959
thc for you know

2032
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,760
reduction of suffering um you know the

2033
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,000
lack of

2034
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,360
that you know causes pain but that's not

2035
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,520
really withdrawal

2036
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:44,079
what are these withdrawal symptoms that

2037
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:47,040
that some of the patients exhibited

2038
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:48,880
well it isn't pink elephants you know

2039
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:53,198
associated

2040
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:55,279
with uh alcohol addiction

2041
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:57,359
rather when people have withdrawal

2042
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:58,479
symptoms from cannabis usage it's

2043
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:00,799
usually

2044
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:02,198
some combination of mild symptoms

2045
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:06,640
anxiety

2046
01:18:02,198 --> 01:18:10,000
insomnia nervousness

2047
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:13,280
it's usually relatively short-lived

2048
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,560
but the fact that people had been

2049
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:17,279
labeled as cannabis

2050
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,320
addicted or admitted to withdrawal

2051
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,519
symptoms

2052
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:25,599
to a higher degree in our population

2053
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,159
is significant and i guess one might

2054
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,199
expect

2055
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:32,479
it from the high levels of use but again

2056
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:36,158
the controls had similar usage rates

2057
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:39,359
without uh the same levels of

2058
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:41,679
addiction or withdrawal so there's

2059
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:45,198
clearly a difference here

2060
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:47,039
the um both this study and an earlier

2061
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:51,439
study that is quoted within

2062
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,439
your um survey um

2063
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,399
list differences between the genders

2064
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,760
both in participation

2065
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:03,519
and in people who are experiencing

2066
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:05,280
um chs are we seeing any

2067
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,880
i don't know you'd call it but gender

2068
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:10,000
predilection for

2069
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:12,800
for you know you know men or women to

2070
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,119
be more likely to get this yeah that's

2071
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,199
always an interesting issue

2072
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,399
it's clear from prior studies that there

2073
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:21,678
seem to be a male

2074
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:25,279
predominance in chs but

2075
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:28,880
that's not what we saw um now

2076
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:31,920
first let's look at what happened before

2077
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:37,440
it is clearly the case that more men

2078
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:41,039
are going to be high volume users of thc

2079
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:45,198
but maybe less and less the case again

2080
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:47,600
given current demographic trends

2081
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:50,399
in our survey we had a female

2082
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:52,079
predominance and both the chs patients

2083
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:54,879
and the controls

2084
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:58,158
now that could be due to the willingness

2085
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:02,239
of women to participate in the study

2086
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:05,839
so hard to say but

2087
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:08,959
i think that it's clear that

2088
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,719
a person of either gender could be

2089
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,760
susceptible

2090
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:17,198
to development of chs if they have

2091
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:22,880
a genetic predilection towards it

2092
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:22,879
and high uh rates of use of thc

2093
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:28,238
all right that makes sense um so

2094
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:29,519
it's interesting too that th that the

2095
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,000
the older study

2096
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:34,080
showed more males and this this newer

2097
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,119
study shows more females

2098
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:40,079
um because the sample size

2099
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:41,279
is you know pretty small in both studies

2100
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:44,559
do you think that's

2101
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:46,880
you know more likely just the randomness

2102
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:50,719
of who who signed up

2103
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,719
it always could be um

2104
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,159
yeah it's certainly possible all right

2105
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:57,599
fair enough

2106
01:20:54,158 --> 01:21:00,719
um you know before this

2107
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,960
survey came out a lot of people who

2108
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:06,000
believed they had chs

2109
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:09,198
were trying to

2110
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,000
help themselves by using cbd

2111
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:13,519
increasing their cannabidiol is there

2112
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:17,198
any suggestion

2113
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:19,840
that cannabidiol because of its general

2114
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:22,399
ability to modulate thc is going to be

2115
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:25,600
any use for us

2116
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:29,119
maybe the problem is

2117
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:31,280
it's not clear cut from the information

2118
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:34,559
that we have at this time

2119
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:38,639
part of the problem of course is that

2120
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:42,400
it's hard to get material that

2121
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:44,880
that is solely cbd with no thc

2122
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,559
on labeling isn't always going to give

2123
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:50,319
you the answer

2124
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,039
either you know we see a fair amount of

2125
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:55,279
thc

2126
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:58,639
contamination if you will of supposed

2127
01:21:55,279 --> 01:22:02,319
cbd material but

2128
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:06,480
it is possible that a pure cbd

2129
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:09,279
preparation might offer some protection

2130
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:11,519
but that's conjectural at this point

2131
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:13,759
and it also may not be what people

2132
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,239
really want

2133
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,520
um meaning it won't get them won't get

2134
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:18,238
them the results that they're looking

2135
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,360
for

2136
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:24,158
exactly right you know why

2137
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:24,719
are people using this much cannabis it

2138
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:27,839
may be

2139
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:29,119
because there are two reasons number one

2140
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:33,920
they enjoy it

2141
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:37,359
and or it's treating something

2142
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:40,560
they're using it to treat something

2143
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:44,079
some symptom that they have um so

2144
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:46,960
could cbd replace that one hopes but

2145
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:48,000
i wouldn't say there's any guarantee at

2146
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,760
all

2147
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,760
uh but there could be other cannabis

2148
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,840
components that are going to be proved

2149
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,159
it proved to be useful

2150
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,079
or adjunctive treatments but again

2151
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:00,319
that's conjectural at this point

2152
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:02,880
and something we'd like to explore in

2153
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:02,880
the future

2154
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:08,158
the five uh the five sites that we

2155
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,280
looked at earlier

2156
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:15,279
um are we aware of um

2157
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:18,479
other other actions that happen

2158
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:20,238
on those sites that could suggest that

2159
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:23,359
there is a different cause

2160
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:24,238
to this than than thc or is the

2161
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:27,759
correlation

2162
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:30,959
so high that that um

2163
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:34,480
you know other other suspects are

2164
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:37,600
less likely yeah it's the latter

2165
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:40,799
um you know thc is the scenic unknown

2166
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:44,639
if there isn't thc a board you don't see

2167
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,920
chs right that part's clear

2168
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,400
so that there might be other things

2169
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:50,399
involved but thc is the

2170
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,238
without that it's not going to happen

2171
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:55,279
yeah there's this expression

2172
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:56,238
uh there's no never and no always in in

2173
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:58,800
medicine

2174
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:00,559
but this is one of those situations

2175
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,079
where it appears that

2176
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:07,520
thc is always associated with chs

2177
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:09,920
right on um great well uh i think that

2178
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,600
wraps us up for today um ethan thank you

2179
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,319

2181
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:17,198
you know chs or or this host of symptoms

2182
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:20,319
has been a boogeyman

2183
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:22,238
in our in our community for so long and

2184
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:24,238
um you know i remember being

2185
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:26,079
down at emerald cup uh i don't know

2186
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:28,799
probably three or four years ago and

2187
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:29,439
we all shared a house and i remember one

2188
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,600
of

2189
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,638
the friends who was staying with us lost

2190
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,000
her whole weekend

2191
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:36,800
because she you know had an attack an

2192
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,119
episode

2193
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,119
and she spent the entire weekend um in

2194
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:42,319
the hot bath and a hot shower and

2195
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:44,399
you know that was my first time that i

2196
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,880
had really come across it and it seemed

2197
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:47,920
absolutely you know terrible to go

2198
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,600
through it but also

2199
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,279
she was there you know as an employee

2200
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,600
before she was where they're working and

2201
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:54,399
she wasn't able to do that either either

2202
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,199
and um

2203
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:59,039
it's nice that there's finally you know

2204
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:01,119
i believe this is

2205
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:02,800
if not the first study to pull it all

2206
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:04,399
together at least the biggest study

2207
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,560
it's nice to see this finally coming

2208
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:10,079
together to put some light on it do you

2209
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:12,239
do you see um research on this

2210
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,000
now continuing like are there already

2211
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:15,599
second and third wave

2212
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,359
studies that have seen what you're doing

2213
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,520
and are ready to jump on and

2214
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:20,399
take the baton well we're not quite

2215
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:24,800
published yet

2216
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:26,559
so no um this uh study has been accepted

2217
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,480
for publication

2218
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:30,400
in the journal called cannabis and

2219
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:33,519
cannabinoid research

2220
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:36,638
we hope that it will spur other efforts

2221
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:40,000
we certainly plan to remain involved

2222
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:43,920
in studying this unusual

2223
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,960
condition um so yeah it's our hope this

2224
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,158
is going to

2225
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:50,319
uh lead to better identification of chs

2226
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:52,158
and hopefully better treatment in the

2227
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:53,439
future all right that's great and and so

2228
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:55,920
if you're listening

2229
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:58,879
