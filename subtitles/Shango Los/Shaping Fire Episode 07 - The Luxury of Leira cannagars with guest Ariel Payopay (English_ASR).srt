2
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:11,400
there are some things in life that take

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,589
a lot of effort to make are made with

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,870
quality in mind and are really truly

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,609
premium I'm talking about things like

6
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,730
shoes that were handmade by an actual

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,320
cobbler or a coat that is so impervious

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,990
to weather that you feel safe when you

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,118
put it on some coats like maybe the one

10
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:29,159
your grandpa used to wear hunting are so

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,289
well made that they just look better the

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,299
more wear and tear they get some

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,750
expensive sports cars to have a certain

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,609
/ that just sounds expensive we may not

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,009
always have the money today to buy these

16
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,628
luxury items we desire but there's no

17
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,628
doubt that we respect them for their

18
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,339
beauty quality and craftsmanship there's

19
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,109
not much like down the cannabis market

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,460
so far most products are whipped

21
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,530
together and put on the market as

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,719
quickly as possible that's why we see so

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,609
much uncured cannabis flower out there

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,219
and why some vaporizers are so

25
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,628
unsatisfying to hold today we're

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,370
focusing on one of the few cannabis

27
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:05,548

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,629
clear that this is not a paid spot I'm

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,520
focusing on them because of their

34
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:19,048
leadership in the industry and because

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,329
I'm just totally a fan of their

36
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,580
attention to detail today's guest is

37
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,069
Ariel pay up a founder of lyric Anna

38
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,469
gars liras canna gars are handmade

39
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,919
contain ultra premium ingredients and

40
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:34,170
have a style and price to match welcome

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,960
to the show Ariel hey thanks for having

42
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,719
me so area you know in an industry when

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,399
so much retail packaging is ugly and we

44
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,289
have to question the quality of the

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,909
cannabis contained within you know it's

46
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,290
encouraging to come across a product

47
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,079
like yours that is not only beautiful

48
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,270
but also packed with top shelf cannabis

49
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,009
why did you decide to serve the ultra

50
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:56,759
premium market instead of the mass

51
00:01:53,009 --> 00:02:00,170
market um because there's a lot of labor

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,810
put into creating a category and so it's

53
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:06,868
like impossible to make it cheap and for

54
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,739
somebody to be paying that amount of a

55
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:12,000
420 dollars for 6-inch category you know

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,379
you want to make sure you have premium

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,139
cannabis and no complaints

58
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:20,909
um I don't want to sugarcoat crap you

59
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:22,829
know so uh Jesus my did you do were you

60
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,949
excited about the ultra premium market

61
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,780
because you wanted to reach out to that

62
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:29,699
particular audience or is it just

63
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,500
because you are a connoisseur and you

64
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:35,849
really only wanted to work with ultra

65
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,599
premium inputs uh kind of both I just

66
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:41,789
saw I just saw opening for it cuz I'm

67
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,829
nobody was really marketing their

68
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:47,039
products that way and there are a few

69
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,410
but I just felt like this this category

70
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,500
would would set a garden apart specia to

71
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:54,240
have premium product and if people want

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,349
premium product don't pay the money for

73
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,700
it so it's nice to to you know be in a

74
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,789
position that you're in we're not really

75
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,619
competing on price you know so many you

76
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,900
know cannabis product folk they're all

77
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,120
trying to get the cheapest inputs

78
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,270
possible so they can get their price low

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,920
so the maximum number of people can buy

80
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,210
it but you know I've been an

81
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,709
entrepreneur for a long time i actually

82
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,150
prefer you know not having the cheapest

83
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,980
product in the market because there's a

84
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,260
there's a certain satisfaction in

85
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,619
providing quality and that sounds to be

86
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:31,530
your approaches as well yeah yeah cuz

87
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,480
I'm there's there's a there's a couple

88
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,490
counter our companies and I'm starting

89
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,679
to see a show up which is pretty cool

90
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,379
what I was expecting but when i started

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,810
my brand I told myself look I'm sticking

92
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:47,129
the premium quality materials

93
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,469
solventless oil and that so it was it

94
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,419
was a big challenge trying the perfect

95
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,209
trying to find that perfect garden that

96
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,599
that met those own qualities there came

97
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:02,550
a point where i did get laid off with a

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,409
job and I I was desperate and all these

99
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,590
gardens that I was meeting weren't

100
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:09,840
meeting my expectations and I almost

101
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,020
jump ship and just went with it and just

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,879
hopefully hope that my categories would

103
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,829
work out but I was like still worried

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,920
because the quality wasn't that great

105
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,259
but luckily a last minute him an

106
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,330
opportunity was brought to me by by gold

107
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,860
leaf they contact me I was like oh my

108
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:27,219
god these guys are like perfect all

109
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,990
organic and

110
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,110
they care about they care about the

111
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,870
product that they give their own that

112
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,069
their customers versus like you can tell

113
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,139
when you look at other gardens they're

114
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:40,329
just all about creating large yields and

115
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,240
making that profit and I didn't I didn't

116
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:45,519
want that with my brand so as far as how

117
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,290
you judge quality mean obviously all of

118
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,599
the legal states are having issues with

119
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,540
pesticides in all different flavors but

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,550
what were you looking for that you would

121
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,930
call quality flower to go into your

122
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,400
categories I mean what were what were

123
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,129
the standards you were looking to have

124
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:03,879
met that you didn't really seem at being

125
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:06,790
met until you met gold leaf um I was

126
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,409
just looking for a good garden that

127
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,530
cared about their customers and they

128
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:18,160
grew organic and didn't use any like

129
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:21,939
crazy pesticides um and they had good

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,650
flower um do they make her do they make

131
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,019
your rasen as well or do you do that in

132
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:30,189
house no we make the Rossignol so well

133
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:31,899
so we get a my friend which is crazy he

134
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:34,240
started working after me we've been like

135
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:37,810
best friend since high school his name's

136
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,000
uh he runs polar ice track so he's good

137
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:44,740
for making like full milk bubble hash

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,139
and he created the hard press um Rasen

139
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,300
press and he started working there so

140
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,360
now we get we collect his bubble hash

141
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,280
and we press that into a rasen for our

142
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,069
category so everything solventless

143
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,939
everything's handcrafted um there's

144
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:02,500
nothing I try to make sure that there's

145
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:06,069
nothing negative people can say about

146
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,228
our products mm-hmm so you know when I

147
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:10,029
first found out about your canna gars

148
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:11,620
and I was looking into him I'm like wow

149
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,228
these are incredible and you know if you

150
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,889
just would have used you know premium

151
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:21,219
gold leaf flower they would have been

152
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,959
amazing just in and of itself why do

153
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,290
what possess you to go ahead and put

154
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,239
dabble rasen oil in there as well

155
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,790
because the more the more concentrates

156
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,600
foot on there the slower the burn and

157
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:36,490
plus you get more flavors and if people

158
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,689
love rosanell Rosen's like the new thing

159
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,610
since um

160
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:44,059
since people are trying to be clean with

161
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,649
her with her cannabis know so I just

162
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:49,579
looked at it like this when I when I

163
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:51,319
before I got into this i saw i saw was

164
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,389
going on with food everybody's talking

165
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,338
about on GMOs this and that and then you

166
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,788
see the cannabis market booming with

167
00:06:55,338 --> 00:07:01,699
like hydro setup skoko cells just

168
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:03,438
feeding bottle nutrients and I was like

169
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,939
well these guys are trying their best to

170
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,619
make their money but nobody's really

171
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:09,409
trying to create that premium product

172
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:10,849
where where you let the plant grow the

173
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:14,988
way it's supposed to be grown you know

174
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:17,149
with living soil and and gold leaf is

175
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:19,698
the only garden that I that I know of in

176
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:23,149
Washington state that that can provide

177
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:25,879
that and we're stuck with them it's

178
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:28,728
crazy it's just like wow how did that it

179
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,588
was like a perfect match like I told you

180
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:32,258
if I told you a story from beginning to

181
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:34,338
end well it's nothing yet but like

182
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,679
everything is just falling into place

183
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:40,309
somehow i don't know how how it happens

184
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:42,678
but you got the top flower producer in

185
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:45,259
Washington not the top bar but premium

186
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:47,478
flower producer in Washington and then

187
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:50,479
when the premium bubble hash producers

188
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:53,838
in Washington and also started his own

189
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:56,449
rasen press um and then now you have us

190
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:59,329
account guards all under one garden I

191
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:01,550
mean like what garden you know in the

192
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:03,588
world that has that and can say they're

193
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,119
clean green yeah right and then like

194
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:07,399
that's where you get the whole ultra

195
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,409
premium by behind and you know it was

196
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:11,119
actually about a year ago actually like

197
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:13,788
very much a year ago that I first got

198
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:16,189
turned on a gold leaf we were on our way

199
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:18,618
driving down to Emerald cup and Aaron

200
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,569
Varney of dockside was in the was in the

201
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:22,550
van with us and he whipped out some of

202
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,860
the gold leaf tangi which is just like

203
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,209
insane you know like like if you smoked

204
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,249
Angie and go in somewhere you don't

205
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:31,009
smell like weed you smell like tangent

206
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:32,329
Angela yeah it's incredible and it was

207
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,829
like you know and their packaging is

208
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:35,568
nice so so yeah if you're going to be

209
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:38,658
stuck with somebody those are good folks

210
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:40,009
to be stuck with so um that's an

211
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:42,740
interesting point you made though about

212
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:44,990
how adding the Raza noil slows the burn

213
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,850
on the canna gars because you know we

214
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,029
all know that that you know when you're

215
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,190
smoking a joint it can run a

216
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:54,339
it can or can burn down faster than you

217
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,370
want to and I can imagine that when your

218
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:01,660
candor gar ZAR are you know big and long

219
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,250
and and you're passing it around a bunch

220
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:06,069
of folks because you know your your

221
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,870
canna cars can just a they're there they

222
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,760
can serve a lot of folks I can imagine

223
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,639
that having the rasen in there so that

224
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,490
the burn is slow is a really good thing

225
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,860
about how long does a typical category

226
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,980
are you know last I mean they've got to

227
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,350
be more than 20 minutes right elbow yeah

228
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,649
almost definitely on the the corona the

229
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:30,250
six-inch one can last from I've heard

230
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:31,959
from five to six hours oh I had a I know

231
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,279
of a couple that took it to feed you and

232
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,019
that's all they brought had left them

233
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,870
for two weeks so they just took drags

234
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:40,059
her in there so I know the longer ones

235
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,549
they burn a lot slower than the petite

236
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:45,369
ones I don't know what why maybe because

237
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:47,139
it's just longer but when you first like

238
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,870
that the tip of the longer ones like you

239
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:53,649
don't see it budge hardly ever take it

240
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,509
as it's it's it's a it's crazy um you

241
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,569
got experience it to like an estate what

242
00:09:55,509 --> 00:10:00,039
I'm talking about it's just amazing so

243
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,320
once and once I figured that out I was

244
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,349
like damn I got it I got a I got a brand

245
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,840
new sand I got a market too so so what

246
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,300
what sizes do the categories come in and

247
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,960
do you see them being sold to different

248
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:16,299
niches in the market um so we have we

249
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,870
have our petite corona which is eight

250
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:21,990
grams of flour and 2 grams of rasen and

251
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,899
it's wrapped with the cannabis leaves

252
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:29,460
that one is a retails for 300 dollars

253
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:32,470
and that's around 4 inches and then our

254
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,769
big one is the corona which is six

255
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:41,259
inches 12 grams of flour and three grams

256
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:43,269
of Ra's and that retails for 420 um this

257
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:45,129
isn't it is it's interesting because

258
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,919
like at first you know some people get

259
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:49,600
sticker shock off of the price it's like

260
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,299
oh my god four hundred and twenty bucks

261
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,370
but then when you see it on you know

262
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:57,009
like your Instagram or something you see

263
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,810
that there's this beautiful koenig are

264
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,338
and it's and it's wrapped with

265
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:03,448
multicolored leaves and

266
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:06,399
in this beautiful packaging and you know

267
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:07,659
how long does it take to make say for

268
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,509
example a corona because obviously

269
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:13,389
there's a lot of of hand artisan love

270
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:17,589
going into it mmm yeah it takes it takes

271
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:21,249
around an hour and then up to three to

272
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:23,259
four weeks secure one of the flourishes

273
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:25,569
that really makes the final product look

274
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:28,149
you know really regal is that you know

275
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:30,248
you you you seal the ends with purple

276
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,860
wax what brought you to decide that you

277
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:35,949
wanted to do something extra like that

278
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:39,789
uh man because when I was in medical man

279
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:41,078
like packaging is horrible everybody had

280
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:42,818
horrible packaging they always talk

281
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,938
about how great of a product i had like

282
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:47,289
by my but by this is the greatest it's

283
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,208
fire and then they throw it in like a

284
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:52,480
mylar bag and like come on dude like

285
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,828
show that you care show that you care

286
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,949
about your customers given the full

287
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:58,328
experience and I'm all about that like

288
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:00,909
that from from the first visual

289
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:03,899
appearance to wrapping it to like

290
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:07,600
everything this I want my customers to

291
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:10,178
get that full experience you know people

292
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,610
remember that total your that's a good

293
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:14,438
point it is an entire brand experience

294
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,959
especially since I would imagine a lot

295
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:18,789
of people are using these for for

296
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,588
celebrations so we're going to take our

297
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:25,599
first short break and be right back you

298
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:27,370
are listening to shaping fire as a

299
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,678
business owner you are incredibly busy

300
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,139
in reality you are responsible for

301
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:34,088
everything your company does you have so

302
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:35,919
many responsibilities every single day

303
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:38,110
that often you just don't have the time

304
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,870
to really dig into something as deeply

305
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,100
as you'd like you know there is more

306
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,350
that you could do to reach out to new

307
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,240
customers and to encourage loyalty and

308
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,069
the customers you already have but you

309
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,959
certainly don't have the time and you're

310
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:52,778
not ready to hire someone full time for

311
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:56,138
that role either for you i recommend

312
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:58,299
blunt branding blunt branding principles

313

00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:07,448
excited to make your logo packaging and

317
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:09,278
website very pretty but they leave

318
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:11,620
responsibility for improving your bottom

319
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,200
line up to you they don't want that kind

320
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,639
of responsibility but that is pretty

321
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,730
much the most important part of

322
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:21,340
marketing right Kirsten and Anthony will

323
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,379

them to your point of sale and keep them

00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:27,820
coming back to you and telling their

326
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,649
friends no doubt this is a paid

327
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,900
commercial spot but that does not mean

328
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,149
they bought my opinion I've worked with

329
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:36,490
blunt branding on three projects now for

330
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:37,689
various clients and every single time

331
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,259
they have done more than they have

332
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,910
promised and over delivered on results I

333
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:45,460
love how they generate new revenue and

334
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:48,189
focus on that as the goal instead of

335
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,320
just making me a pretty logo similarly

336
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,180
every friend I've referred them to has

a founder of lyric anna gars so before

356
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:42,219
the break we were talking about the the

357
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,009
artisan craftsmanship that goes into

358
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,769
making these and how you know these take

359
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,990
in an hour or more to make and all of

360
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:52,779
the very ultra premium ingredients that

361
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:59,379
go inside did you already have a

362
00:14:52,779 --> 00:15:00,819
pre-existing background in making cigars

363
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:04,059
and such or did you have to teach

364
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,730
yourself how to do this i I kind of

365
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:09,429
taught myself like I saw people doing

366
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,070
the categories with the with the string

367
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:16,449
method where they formed the cores

368
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:18,100
around the skewer and I just I mean it

369
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,440
looked awesome to me the first person I

370
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,379
saw do that was an artist called afgoo

371
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,060
afgoo head and he's the one that like

372
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:26,409
blew my mind with these categories like

373
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,339
well you could actually make categories

374
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:30,730
it with

375
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,639
with cannabis and I just watched how he

376
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,720
did his thing but um I thought in my

377
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:39,039
head I was like there's no way this

378
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,899
could be a done in full-scale production

379
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:45,099
because like that would take hours to

380
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:47,379
like slowly tryna buds around a skewer

381
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,420
um so I didn't even bother doing that

382
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,399
but I was just always in my head trying

383
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:53,049
to figure out a way to speed that that

384
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,000
core process up because building the

385
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:57,159
core a clean course of the biggest

386
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,649
foundation to creating clean counter

387
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:05,769
guards and my buddy I told my buddy

388
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:07,689
surrounding the hard press guy um he was

389
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:10,960
he also got fascinated by the counter

390
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,520
guards and he got into it but he was

391
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,080
still doing the string method and I was

392
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,429
like there has to be there has to be

393
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,129
another way around this because I'm not

394
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:19,899
doing this thing the string and this is

395
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,129
not going to sell to like a garden or

396
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:24,399
anything if I told him I wanted to go

397
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:27,250
into business with this so he later on

398
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,329
as he was rolling these categories he

399
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,850
just quit because he said it was just

400
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,780
time consuming but he told me a tip he's

401
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,060
like you know what if you're going to

402
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:37,029
get into this try this method it might

403
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,500
work and sure enough I took off with it

404
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,569
was like yup this is it this is this

405
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,639
what this is what it takes two to make

406
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,820
these categories and production

407
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,669
full-scale production and so I just

408
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,980
attacked it I figured it out and and

409
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:53,439
that was just abstract enough of a

410
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,240
description to let us know that you

411
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,470
develop some best practices that are not

412
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,529
your trade secrets right yeah yeah so um

413
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,870
did when you were trying to figure out

414
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:07,329
how to make the production as reliable

415
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,489
as possible did you find that you were

416
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,669
just doing trial and error or did you go

417
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:15,370
back and research how cigars are made

418
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,870
and then kind of like cross apply that

419
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,729
manufacturing technique or did you not

420
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:22,059
even really bother to go to how tobacco

421
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:24,400
cigars are made oh man I watched men

422
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:27,220
yeah I love you too because I watched so

423
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,009
many YouTube documentaries and on how

424
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,960
they roll can't rolled cigars and just

425
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:34,660
because you only need that one little

426
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,079
tip to just spark that idea in your head

427
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,690
and man i watch hours and it only took

428
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,109
me like a minute of all those hours that

429
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,120
I

430
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:45,069
to figure out like certain tricks on my

431
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,479
counter gars I mean if you really want

432
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:49,178
to figure out how to roll a category

433
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,500
you'll get it but if you're just gonna

434
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:53,048
keep bugging people they're not gonna

435
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,548
trade secrets so that that's that's how

436
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:56,109
that's how I am with a lot of things

437
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:58,779
like I don't have patience for people to

438
00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:00,189
teach me stuff or do stuff for me so I

439
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,769
like to figure things out on my own

440
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,660
which is why which is a cool thing how I

441
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:07,450
got into branding it and stuff like that

442
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,769
because i was i got a top much wine and

443
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,269
teach much i went to school for graphic

444
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:15,730
design and I have little like

445
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:18,339
photography skills so I figured I just

446
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,759
combined it and help brand my help

447
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:23,289
market my product usually certainly you

448
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,079
certainly have an aesthetic quality

449
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:28,569
because the whole package from from you

450
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,058
know from your Instagram and and showing

451
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:33,399
the pictures to creating the product to

452
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:35,019
all the way to to the displays that you

453
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,530
make for the stores I mean it's it's an

454
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:40,569
entire ecosystem of gorgeous which which

455
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:43,178
you know it's probably demanded to be

456
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:47,460
able to get the prices that that you're

457
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:49,809
asking for you know when when you are

458
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,600
having so much success I can imagine

459
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:56,230
that you have to continually add more

460
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:59,048
folks in manufacturing rolling and and

461
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,390
you know you spent all this time kind of

462
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:03,548
being mentored by YouTube and trial and

463
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,190
error do you find that it's challenging

464
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:08,079
to teach the new hires how to do this

465
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,519
properly and do you find some people

466
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,579
that just don't have the chops for and

467
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,650
you just have to like get somebody else

468
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:17,259
um well right now I just taught I've

469
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:20,380
taught my brother and then my wife and

470
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:22,119
also my sister-in-law how to roll in my

471
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,160
brother only took him like a week to

472
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,918
learn same same with the girls it took

473
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,830
them like a week or two and once you get

474
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,650
into it you're flowing after that um the

475
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:34,779
the real the real problem is is like

476
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,880
streamlining the whole process like

477
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:39,129
making sure that we're always have like

478
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,070
a stock of fresh leads that we can use

479
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,660
or making sure the Rosens was always

480
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:46,509
there enough flowers always there but

481
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,070
the biggest the biggest pain is is the

482
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:49,359
leaves because you can't just use all

483
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:52,000
the leaves you got to use the nice ones

484
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,709
you know and at all the leaves we

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,779
gravity on these like a small percentage

486
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,100
of them

487
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:59,259
one of the things that is especially

488
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:01,359
cool about how the Canada gars look is

489
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:03,670
that a lot of them have got two tone

490
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,379
leaves and you know we all love how you

491
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,720
know different ladies express themselves

492
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,520
in the lead especially you know if it's

493
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,319
outdoor and fall time comes you know and

494
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,150
they start to they start to change color

495
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,509
and that's gorgeous but you know it

496
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:18,400
really adds to the artisan vibe of it

497
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:20,799
you know you can you're reminded that

498
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,650
this is a product that's from nature and

499
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,349
that these are being made by hand when

500
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:29,800
they're not you know uniform all the

501
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:31,539
same each one of them you can almost you

502
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,180
can see the variety of nature in that I

503
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:37,029
think people really dig that yeah yeah

504
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,490
that's what i've heard like when i first

505
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,440
got into like thisor i always thought

506
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,120
like should there be a way we can make

507
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,830
these like perfect so they look all the

508
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,589
same and in a lot of people's like nah

509
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:49,389
it looks it looks original like each one

510
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:54,179
looks unique just keep it that way so

511
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:57,040
they okay um with your relationship with

512
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,350
with gold leaf did that come with a

513
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,299
distribution deal as well are you out

514
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:04,049
there going to retailers yourself trying

515
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:07,149
to encourage them to carry your product

516
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:11,500
almost we don't have enough product to

517
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:21,580
supply the retailer's us so we only work

518
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:25,059
with certain retailers um yeah so um so

519
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:26,559
are you planning on on increasing your

520
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,940
production is that the idea right now is

521
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,919
that you're setting up you know best

522
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,950
practices and figuring out how to do it

523
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,570
and then scaling up or or is it you know

524
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,000
like hey you're using everything that

525
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:39,490
that gold leaf has available and and

526
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,769
your kind of restrained because of the

527
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:47,500
the inventory of quality inputs that are

528
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:49,059
available um I'm kind of in the middle

529
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,359
of that right now trying to see which

530
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:55,179
direction I should go with my company um

531
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,879
I have some advices that I'm speaking to

532
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,640
that I'll help me find direction because

533
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,230
you know business is all new to me and

534
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,560
doing this is all new this crazy unlike

535
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,849
doing everything and

536
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,059
yeah I thought about like either

537
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:13,990
licensing out my brand and to other

538
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:16,210
states or even getting my own facility

539
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,930
to to a bigger market such as California

540
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:23,500
or maybe New York or something like a

541
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:24,820
large a large market like that our

542
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,049
people are you asking you about the

543
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:28,710
licensing you know are you already

544
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:32,500
fielding calls from people who want yes

545
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:34,480
I get a lot of messages about a come

546
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,680
here come there let what how can we

547
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,930
carry your product and this and that

548
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,210
it's like a lot of people don't

549
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,130
understand is you can't push these out

550
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,970
like joints and balance or whatever

551
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:49,540
they're all handcrafted so a lot of

552
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,860
investors they get when they look at

553
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:56,500
that they they want to see a big return

554
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:58,449
with these um with these categories but

555
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,009
with the large with large volumes but

556
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,509
you can't you can't do that yet there

557
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:03,549
you have to respect it as an art because

558
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:05,049
if you rush this you could ruin the

559
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,480
product the quality of the product you

560
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:09,519
know yeah and you know and people are

561
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,460
only going to pay the premium price if

562
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:15,430
it is actually a premium product and I

563
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,620
can imagine that all sorts of folks who

564
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,420
are more interested in the margins than

565
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:21,309
in the quality of the product would

566
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,870
quickly dilute the quality of what

567
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:26,529
you're putting into it whether it is in

568
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:28,119
effort or n inputs yeah yeah yeah yeah

569
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:30,190
right on well we're going to go ahead

570
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,719
and take our second short break we will

571
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:36,910
be right back you are listening to

572
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,650
shaping fire businesses everywhere are

573
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,779
constantly striving to reach out to

574
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,430
people through advertising we all know

575
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:44,049
though that trying to reach a cannabis

576
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,910
audience with a quality message is

577
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:47,799
pretty difficult that's why many people

578
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:50,769
choose to advertise on the shaping fire

579
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,599
podcast advertising on this show allows

580
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:54,460
us time to talk about your product

581
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,409
service or brand in a way that really

582
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,840
lets people know what sets your company

583
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,340
apart from others bold people who own

584
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,869
companies know that getting in a

585
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:05,109
relationship with our customers is

586
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:07,149
essential that is what we offer we will

587
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:09,609
explain your service or product and what

588
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,830
sets it apart as desirable and help our

589
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:14,079
audience get in contact with you it's

590
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:16,149
pretty simple really advertising does

591
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,099
not have to be all whiz-bang smoke and

592
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,840
mirrors nowadays I find

593
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:22,209
that people prefer just to be spoken to

594
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,459
calmly accurately and with good

595
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,130
intentions if you want to make your own

596
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,808
commercial spot you can do that too

597
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:31,330
because the podcast is young but growing

598
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:33,308

your host Shango Lohse and our guest

616
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:14,589
this week is ariel pay up a founder of

617
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:16,479
lyric anna gars so before the break we

618
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:18,879
were talking about you know how much

619
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,360
time it takes to make one of these canna

620
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,280
gars and how huge the demand is and and

621
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,740
that you really can't meet the demand

622
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,329
just because you know you can only put

623
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,179
out so many of these while keeping the

624
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:33,579
quality high it would seem to me that a

625
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:36,700
big reason for your success is how

626
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:38,619
gorgeous your social media feed is you

627
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,990

628
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:42,729
media or did you hire somebody on I mean

629
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,190

stream so gorgeous um no I don't have

632
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:54,850
any background in a social media I just

633
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:57,789

social media like well for one I know my

635

636
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:04,720
to like model off of like um clothing

637
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,558
brands such as like supreme how they do

638
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,480
their their marketing in nike just just

639
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,980
showing little snippets of the product

640
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,429
and hyping people of what's that what's

641

647
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,278
about people who smoke cannabis and

648
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:36,490
I want to change that they're like

649
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,798
successful CEOs business owners that

650
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,990
smoke cannabis every day but they don't

651
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,668
like to admit to it but now that they

652
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,019
have my product they're like oh yeah

653

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:52,990
Oh what is that and it's crazy like I

656
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:55,389
did my first wedding and they order like

657
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,460
20 categories for their wedding and like

658
00:26:55,388 --> 00:27:01,089
who ever thought about having a cannabis

659
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:03,759
at their wedding like that is um is

660
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:06,730
crazy is it certainly makes it a lot

661
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,099
easier for for you know wealthy family

662
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,419
wealthy stoners if you will to identify

663
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:13,480
with your product right because you know

664
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:17,049
so much of canvas marketing is like big

665
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:20,499
clouds of smoke and people you know you

666
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:22,628
know let's just say not not acting in an

667
00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:25,329
you know premium market kind of way

668
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:27,308
let's say okay and so and so you know in

669
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:29,168
your stream is filled with you know

670
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:30,878
people who are having some success in

671
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:34,778
their life and they're all like you know

672
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:37,028
I work hard and and I deserve nicer

673
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:39,308
things because I you know I put in so

674
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:43,509
much effort and so and so I'm enjoying

675
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:46,148
this this category we can do that I bet

676
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:47,889
you that that market is is not only

677
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:50,648
large but really grateful to have

678
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:52,648
something that speaks to the amount of

679
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:57,518
effort they put into their own lives

680
00:27:52,648 --> 00:28:00,339
yeah it's crazy it's just seeing people

681
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,618
from all walks of life in just being

682
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:06,308
interested in these categories like even

683
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:09,668
people like I have a lot of cigar

684
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:11,528
aficionados messaging me um some of them

685
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:13,240
they've never tried cannabis before or

686
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:15,128
they'll be like oh that that is a great

687
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,019
product you have I never tried cannabis

688
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:19,990
but if that was in front of me I

689
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:23,679
definitely smoke it or you had that

690
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:27,069
cigar smoker that just uh they always

691
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,798
something like I grew up smoking weed in

692
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:32,950
my high school years but as I advance in

693
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:35,109
life you know I came home and I smoke

694
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,690
blunts and joints or out of a bonnet it

695
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:40,839
just seemed like a never grew cannabis

696
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,808
grew up and now that you've created this

697
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,339
more mature side of cannabis I want to

698
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:48,069
start smoking weed again

699
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:49,750
so is this kind of crazy I always ask

700
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:52,329
people like I have a lot of friends

701
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,339
that's used to be big stoners in college

702
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:55,659
or this an adder and then they tell me

703
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,829
they just grew out of it I was like what

704
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,860
it mean you grew out of it like you

705
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:02,019
still drink nobody nobody grows out of

706
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:04,779
drink unless they just want to quit due

707
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:05,980
to health reasons or something and so I

708
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,349
want to know why people want to quit

709
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,319
smoking cannabis and they just basically

710
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:12,609
told me just it just got tired of it

711
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,970
just then you feel like they're

712
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:17,649
advancing or anything so now I got that

713
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,299
top shelf product or they're like yeah I

714
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,800
want that that's something I won't look

715
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,960
forward to this weekend or for the

716
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,789
celebration or you know yeah it is

717
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,009
certainly a desirous thing you know I

718
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,200
mean there aren't a lot of products in

719
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:30,309
cannabis that I kind of fetishize over

720
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,140
but you know I've been following your

721
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:34,329
Instagram free for a while now and I'm

722
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,340

724
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:39,220
want one of those for my selves there

725
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,010
because they're there they really are

726
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,930
you know they're an art object as much

727
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:45,099
as they're a smokable thing when you

728
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,320
were when you were mentioning these

729
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:49,149
folks who you know you know toked back

730

731
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,240
into business and they haven't talked in

732
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,680
a long time now they suddenly do I bet

733
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,960
you those folks need to be careful to

734
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,700
because going from like talking you know

735
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,029
all these years ago in college to

736
