1
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,890
Tom lubberman known to most of us has

2
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,839
sparked Tom as an organic farmer social

3
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,649
activists surfer and a leader in

4
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,480
cannabis normalization in 1999 his legal

5
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:28,118
collective medical marijuana garden was

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,130
rated which set my path of speaking out

7
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,829
and speaking up for cannabis patients

8
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:35,198
everywhere for her Tom first got my

9
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:38,829
attention as a legit organic food farmer

10
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:41,170
growing beets broccoli cucumbers chard

11
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,969
tomatoes onions among other food crops

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,960
and bringing them into the Clark County

13
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:50,230
Fair in 2015 this food crops 117 blue

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,739
ribbons and a judges Choice Award I soon

15
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:56,140
heard about his CSA for cannabis and it

16
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:57,429
blew my mind you know for those of you

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,039
who weren't here in the early days of

18
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:01,899
India that's why Vimeo was started was

19
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,329
to promote cannabis on the island as a

20
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:06,549
way to save our organic family farms on

21
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:08,679
the island the idea at that point before

22
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,750
we saw the regulations was that we

23
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:12,909
wanted to support farmers and adding

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,579
cannabis to their crops to take some of

25
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:17,469
the pricing pressure off of the food to

26
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:21,159
just let be food and less of a commodity

27
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:24,340
I heard about Tom's CSA and white damn

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,310
he's doing the ideal of what the whole

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,329
reason I started my organization

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,009
unfortunately over time we know that

31
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:32,170
that's not allowed anymore in Washington

32
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,450
which is a drag but for a while he was

33
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,509
living the dream of what I started Vimeo

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,299
for Tom has since diversified his

35
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:42,399
interests co-branding a craft beer with

36
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:45,039
he's even brewing in Vancouver

37
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,280
Washington called farmer Tom's super

38
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:49,539
dang IPA and

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,159

Control has been to his farm to study

48
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:23,079
cannabis best practices and has asked

49
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:24,809
for his help in a write his safety

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,219

[Applause]

56
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:05,009
so many Bibles have been up here kind of

57
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,649
blew my mind when he asked me to be up

58
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:09,750
here so this is pretty much about a huge

59
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,379
honor for me so thanks for showing up

60
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,049
and a little bit about me I

61
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:17,639
was born and raised in San Diego just go

62
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,730
right into an agriculture stuff I

63
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,839
started last getting engaged well I may

64
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:24,628
ever had a landscape construction

65
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,689
company so I started planting planting

66
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:30,120
ground cover at a really young age and

67
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:32,459
so that kind of got me into agriculture

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,259
and growing plants and vegetables and

69
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,209
cannabis and everything we have an

70
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,789
organic sustainable farm down in

71
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,680
Vancouver where we grow our vegetables

72
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,769
and our canvas the same way everything

73
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,500
gives the same process you know we're

74
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,689
big lawyer beaters we're big in the

75
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,030
living soil we use lots of microbes when

76
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:53,579
we feed the microbes and we have a

77
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,500
pretty simple process and you know so

78
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,560
I'm just going to kind of take it up

79
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,389
from when I kind of start I'm sort of

80
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,150
thinking about harvesting it's like at

81
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,500
the end of July and

82
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,859
so I want to keep my plants growing

83
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,139
every day so what I do is I go in every

84
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:12,750
day each plant night but I take four big

85
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,699
please not the main stock and not to

86
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,879
shock it so I want to keep it growing so

87
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,829
every day so this is for the small

88
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,870
grower who's got time to love and

89
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,478
nurture their plants this is pretty much

90
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,120
in the way that I do that I've never

91
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,300
read any books about you know growing

92
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,240
cannabis

93
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,129
and I'm really not that you know school

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,810
worthy of cannabis I just been doing a

95
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:37,240
long time and just kind of ran through

96
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,889
what I did in the last different my

97
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,408
whole lives I've always kind of bragged

98
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:44,650
about my poles because one of my big

99
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:47,740
kids usually cost me about 20 bucks and

100
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:49,299
that's what nutrients and compost and

101
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,269
everything I've always been pretty

102
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,590
thrifty guy in agriculture that's where

103
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:56,829
you kind of got to do the best you can

104
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:59,198
so so what I like to do in July is I

105
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:02,469
start to like get in there either one

106
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,939
one bigger branch on the inside or two

107
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,889
or four leaves or two like stems on the

108
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,288
inside and then go through all the

109
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,000
plants every day and I try to just take

110
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:14,860
a little bit a little bit a little bit

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,050
off so they keep control growing and

112
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,300
what that does is it opens up the inside

113
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,520
the plants we can breathe you know being

114
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,560
on the west side of the Cascades you get

115
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,839
a lot of moisture be a lot of humidity

116
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,280
and it all gets caught up in those

117
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,128
plants that's where most of the powdery

118
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,709
mildew starts on the opposite side like

119
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:36,819
on you get a poverty building one like

120
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:39,519
the north side a lot the north east side

121
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,780
especially it's really prevalent that's

122
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,399
kind of where it starts and it grows

123
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,888
from cuz that's a shady spot on the

124
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,228
plants me like you're clean up all of

125
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,718
that that dark side that north side we

126
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:52,028
like to clean that out a lot and it also

127
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:54,389
promotes ventilation where we live are

128
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:56,978
pretty blessed with

129
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,139
really a really nice wind where we live

130
00:05:56,978 --> 00:06:01,508
so we live up the Columbia River and

131
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,490
every day like 3 o'clock we get these

132
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:06,100
nice breezes and they blow through until

133
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,050
about 10 o'clock at night I've never

134
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,240
so I always keep those signs of

135
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,490
greenhouse open it makes for a nice

136
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
ventilation and it keeps the plants nice

137
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,199
and healthy I like to plant right into

138
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,509
the ground I think there's a good energy

139
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,509
spirit when the class did a little bit

140
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:23,620
better if they're actually in the ground

141
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,779
about you've heard of people hold back

142
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:29,170
throwing pots but actually ground their

143
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:31,299
plants off you know to the earth so

144
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,949
there's there's some there's some you

145
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,949
know we're big on

146
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:41,860
feeding the soil and we're really huge

147
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:44,250
on microbes and minerals are eemiller

148
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:48,490
eyes in the soil we use a

149
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:51,100
sea-90 which is a CC product out of Bob

150
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,560
it comes out of scamaz legume twice a

151
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,230
year that have a salt plant down there

152
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,149
and it floods over and once they take

153
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,430
the salt out there's just a mineral base

154
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:01,989
so we've been using this for three years

155
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,840
and there's a lot of life and it really

156
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,060
brings minerals back into the finished

157
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,649
product and we only spot in agriculture

158
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,620
that was always the missing thing so we

159
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:14,169
use a lot of rock dust and sea solids in

160
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,780
there and the rock dust we use those

161
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:19,090
guys green and it's out of Canada and

162
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:22,509
the reason we use that one is because it

163
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:24,399
has the lowest salt content a lot of the

164
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,360
rockness out there have pretty high salt

165
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:31,149
contents and this one has lowest by far

166
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,660
so as we get into this time of the year

167
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:36,549
it's a race you know

168
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,010
the weather's come then we've gotten

169
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,290
rain already and the moistures up and we

170
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,819
already our Bloods already got wet so

171
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,830
I'm sure

172
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:47,079
starting to bedrock and stuff like that

173
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:49,810
so it's key right now to start you know

174
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,569
harvesting as quick as possible you know

175
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,300
what I'm usually looking for when to

176
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,610
first are harvesting is is we try to

177
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,569
wait as long as we can in this industry

178
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:03,610
and we've been doing a while the whole

179
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:07,319
deal was was if you didn't have little

180
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,319
powdery or the white you didn't

181
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,500
really spread quick and if you don't

182
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,170
have much time and you work in a regular

183
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,600
job you get a wall you get it the first

184
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,240
sign take it down especially this time

185
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,430
you don't try to cut it out don't try to

186
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,769
fix it you're just wasting your time

187
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,769
just whack that thing get it out of

188
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:35,559
there hang it out to dry so now we get

189
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:36,970
in a little bit about harvesting well

190
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,279
let's do a little bit about communion

191
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:44,500
still so what we do is

192
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,959
right about now we've got our legs

193
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,450
showing pretty well and I'd like to

194
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,310
leave it

195
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,890
so the plants about four feet tall like

196
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:56,019
to have about this much breather here at

197
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:58,659
the bottom I kind of scanned everything

198
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,730
up pretty well until there's like a good

199
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:04,149
crown here so you've got like four sets

200
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:07,750
of stamps coming out of the main base I

201
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:10,059
made cola and all that from the bottom

202
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,799
down needs to go especially at this time

203
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:13,629
of year if you have extra time you

204
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,459
really need to be stripping your plants

205
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:17,529
down because it's going to get mold

206
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,259
leading thus getting it wet and you got

207
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,698
to keep it under cover you really need

208
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,560
to keep all your stuff and their

209
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:25,439
greenhouses or under some type of tarp

210
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,659
with bands on it it's really key

211
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,250
especially this time here we're not

212
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:32,129
having the in his summer that we had

213
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,970
last year I really feel sorry for all

214
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,970
the growers who

215
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:54,389
and this started that the second and

216
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,669
third week and ranked all the way

217
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:59,789
through December II us and some way the

218
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:02,789
weather isn't down here the plants will

219
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:05,669
finish the best they can as weather is

220
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:08,188
cooler in damper we're gonna travel I

221
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:10,948
have to make seed so those fish as much

222
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:13,500
as they can and take them as long as you

223
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:15,539
can until you know you start seeing any

224
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,250
kind of wider any kind of better I like

225
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:20,188
they can't say it enough as soon as you

226
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,809
see one spot you've got to cut that

227
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:24,328
thing down against the leader you know

228
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,099
losing all that time just think you put

229
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:29,838
all that effort in all the way from may

230
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,490
all the way through October and you know

231
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,220
you don't act on it see what agriculture

232
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,990
is all about this to really be a good

233
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,759
authority you need to be under property

234
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,370
all the time you need to be able to live

235
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,649
with the seasons and the changes and the

236
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,078
way everything goes because I the drop

237
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,929
of a dime in any agricultural business

238
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:52,049
you gotta change what you're doing flip

239
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:54,750
to another mode take do it until it's

240
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:57,569
done you know me growing up to 90 plants

241
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,059
before and our two greenhouses him and

242
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,800
that's a race you know this year they

243
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,899
cut us way down and I'm just going for

244
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,839
so this year has really been more

245
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,389
relaxation enjoyable for me I really

246
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,160
been able to get in their grocery you

247
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:12,990
know grows an exceptionally beautiful

248
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:17,360
cannabis issue because I've been able to

249
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:21,029
spend so much time in energy and love so

250
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,850
so what's the big goes we'd like to keep

251
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:27,929
you in as big of pieces as possible like

252
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:30,480
you know four big branches coming out

253
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:32,959
from the main stock and we tried a lot

254
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,110
of lots of big chunks and then we

255
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,550
hanging as we do a couple process first

256
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,009
thing we did wanted to do is we want to

257
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:42,750
get it in the house and we wanted to get

258
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,360
in dark and we wanted to hang it up so

259
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,789
first thing we do take leave so we go

260
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,470
rabbit will sit there a little big leave

261
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:52,230
all the big leaves off the next up

262
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,210
anything is touching to the touch in the

263
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,250
main stock any leaflets coming out of

264
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,870
there's coming out right away then we

265
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,019
bring it in the house and then within

266
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,929
the next three days we starts you

267
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,329
prepare for what we do this with all

268
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:09,029
those leaves like believe we harvested

269
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:13,379
obama some obama curse the other day

270
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:15,209
last plan actually and man even on the

271
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,559
big families the track comes where all

272
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,990
the way at the bottom side of your

273
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,939
enemies so what we do is we collected

274
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,009
all those you put them in brown paper

275
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,640
bags you put them in the freezer right

276
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:28,439
away is we're gonna make ice hash out so

277
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,639
we made nice tops out of everything you

278
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,459
know when medical changed up here kind

279
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,799
of push this into into Rosman because we

280
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:37,809
couldn't do plug DHL anymore because it

281
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:40,479
was regulated but that's what we pushed

282
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:42,699
for but you know we we kind of fought to

283
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,159
get how the concentrates legal in the

284
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,810
state you know because the kids were

285
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,809
blowing themselves that's why we push

286
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:52,329
the legislature into it so hard but now

287
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:54,399
the in medical are not been regulated I

288
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:58,480
think to keep the gamma I really prefer

289
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,789
rosin over to over a lot of the pho we

290
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,620
were flavorful way more better product

291
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:05,620
you know it's funny we've been taking

292
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,139
pounds make a nice taciturnity do a

293
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,060
chunk like this and they end up like six

294
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:15,278
grams of rosin so everybody goes what

295
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:18,399
it's the best of the best so I could

296
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,830
take my six ounces right away right off

297
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,940
the top I can put it in there I could

298
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:28,060
turn it in the house and I do have

299
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:30,160
broccoli now if you have known 5050 to

300
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:32,879
John go back told me this the other beat

301
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,309
down there's no

302
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:39,250
the new law there's no limit for it so

303
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:40,869
my theory as well it's all the language

304
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,789
you know you'd be getting good money for

305
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,250
that language out there you know you

306
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:47,019
pick it up a lot of money so all the

307
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,120
let's be able to grow cannabis you're

308
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,578
not an evil a lot of money passed hands

309
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,980
so all of us would be out of the game

310
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:56,828
you know they think they see us is the

311
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,990
big threat you know I see Oregon is more

312
00:13:56,828 --> 00:14:00,189
of a threat

313
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,610
and all the leave they're going down

314
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,649
that unbelievable went up dirt road a

315
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,709
couple

316
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:13,028
weeks ago to mild air rub every

317
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:15,798
Christian redneck seniors now everybody

318
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:18,850
not only do they have supposing that ten

319
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:21,399
plants and all the hundred gallon pots

320
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,420
that worried about the black market

321
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,489
they're gonna build that the black

322
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,778
market for Washington is what they

323
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,759
should be worried about then being able

324
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:31,249
to go to the rep stores in orbit and

325
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,739
purchase because the price differences

326
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:36,499
soap is so dramatic down there you know

327
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:39,350
a lot less than twenty thousand really

328
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:42,798
did a little all day long everything's

329
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:46,308
really cheap so I've got a digress back

330
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:48,528
into so we keep the walk that shape

331
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:49,969
these put them in the freezer where

332
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:52,100
they're running in the couple days and

333
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,989
then the next process we like to take

334
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,230
everything that's attached to a stamp

335
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:59,480
all the loneliest everything so within

336
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,089
the first three days we go through and

337
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,058
we cut off all of those leaves that are

338
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,189
attached to the stem and then we be kind

339
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:09,438
of laughing about eighteen it's called

340
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:11,208
us there pulls about this big what kind

341
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:14,659
of up in the eighteen inches will keep

342
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:17,328
that is bug and hang that up as bud and

343
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:21,578
the rest of it will be stripped off the

344
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:24,168
stalks and fresh frozen for more ice -

345
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:26,899
so we only want to keep the colas for

346
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:29,448
smoking and the rest of this meat and

347
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:32,600
it's way better than trying it out we

348
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:35,328
click click click into a brown paper bag

349
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,369
put something nasty tape I throw it in

350
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:40,548
the freezer and you're done I mean how

351
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:42,410
easy is that instead of drying in it you

352
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:44,778
know all these different things but then

353
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:46,730
to make a shot of it for me it doesn't

354
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,529
make sense I'm all about all fresh

355
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,289
frozen

356
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,549
as efficiently as possible

357
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:55,240
there's a bunch of different ways to do

358
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:57,009
this and this is this land area so we

359
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,570
take all those butts out then we keep

360
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:00,789
their big buds and what we'll do is

361
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,310
we'll leave them out there until the

362
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:05,199
skin the skin snaps pretty easily one of

363
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,059
the stamps out of the colon and then

364
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,460
we'll what we'll do from there as well

365
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:12,399
[ __ ] them down a little bit more and

366
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:16,259
then put them into hub we like to use

367
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,059
brown paper bags grocery bags

368
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:21,399
you know I mean they're they're really

369
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:23,409
great part of their curing process and

370
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,409
they're a really great part of you know

371
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:28,179
keeping your campus if you like in your

372
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:29,980
ears before we have a lot of cannabis

373
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:33,939
like waiting around to be sure so much

374
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:36,700
and we actually stored a lot of our our

375
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,000
buds and brown paper bags missing how

376
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,000
long

377
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:45,009
the brown paper kind of regulates the

378
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,860
moisture inside it actually keeps it in

379
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:50,080
pretty good shape you know surprisingly

380
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,600
so I mean if you if you have a lot and

381
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,430
you have a lot to process that's one way

382
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,800
to do it you know then pull it out every

383
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:58,719
every week or so and you know make sure

384
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,659
to grease a little bit and wrap it back

385
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,000
up and and that's not that's not a bad

386
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:07,029
way to do it and all the pet time it's

387
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,849
time to go in to put initiative so after

388
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:11,769
they put in the paper bag

389
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:14,289
we cure enough so with the main stock

390
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:17,170
snaps and it's ready to go from that

391
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:21,159
point on you can put them into you baby

392
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:24,220
bags which are like turkey bag and then

393
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,400
we absolutely use cellophane bags when

394
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,700
we've used a lot of farm for years

395
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,460
like the self and so on are with them so

396
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,960
it works you do work pretty good use big

397
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:39,360
cellophane bags it's a web product and

398
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,850
and we keep them in there so we'll burp

399
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,959
them in there and you know leave the bag

400
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:48,779
open you know so they're out like every

401
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,370
every you know like every three days to

402
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,289
start off you're doing the birthing

403
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:55,079
process whether you go into the jars

404
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:57,599
with whatever the dark process actually

405
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,299
is the best process if you have the time

406
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,240
and you have the jars and you've got the

407
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:05,789
patience to do it then the jar technique

408
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,620
is probably the best technique you know

409
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:09,059
so after after it comes out of the grout

410
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,399
get a little bag we'll knock it down a

411
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:13,799
little bit more we'll put it into jars

412
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,300
and you want to try to pack the jars as

413
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,089
much as possible you don't want to leave

414
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:20,730
a lot of air in the jar

415
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:23,250
that's you know there's once you have

416
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,890
air in there you know the oxidation

417
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,289
process scars so you wanna have a little

418
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,600
air in any of the stuff you have there's

419
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:33,029
probably the best way to do it you also

420
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:36,480
want to be able to take it out and move

421
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:39,230
it around so it's a it's a juggling act

422
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,710
as far as

423
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:46,140
the curing process goes will won't like

424
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,299
jar it all up and then we'll just stop

425
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,970
will do will burp every day for a day or

426
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:53,220
two and then we'll group everything and

427
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,589
then we'll burp air before it is and

428
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,860
we'll just keep going out until we like

429
00:18:55,589 --> 00:19:01,099
to do a 16 day cure is a process

430
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:03,329
probably the best cure out there

431
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,869
when we did the markets all the time

432
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:07,149
that was kind of gold standard for

433
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:08,799
Kennedy you seem to be able to get it

434
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,750
dry and I can get a taste and get a

435
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,599
nothing getting ready to the market and

436
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,059
it still holds all its flavor in tastes

437
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,949
and aromas and stuff so that's the

438
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:20,950
that's the time period that we've looked

439
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,140
for for them for the Cure so and I

440
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:27,009
haven't I've been given some of those

441
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,230
big those big tins you know that do get

442
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:31,569
out of here again but I haven't tried it

443
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,000
yet I think I'm gonna try them this year

444
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:36,759
somebody gave a couple to have the show

445
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,400
on I think I'll give them a try penny I

446
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:41,109
really like to cure I really like to

447
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,880
make sure whenever I've gotten anything

448
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:44,219
that there's that there's a little air

449
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,000
in there as possible

450
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:50,620
because they're

451
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,890
so another thing we like to keep all of

452
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:55,449
our stuff and the cool done room so we

453
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,000
have a special room in the house work

454
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,910
and it's actually inside one where our

455
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,859
sauna so we keep it all in this wood

456
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,420
sauna that we have and we packed it all

457
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:05,859
up in there and that's kind of where we

458
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,140
kept it over the years it's in the

459
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:09,509
middle of the house it it's dark and

460
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:14,080
it's cool and

461
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:17,259
see everybody seems to invite when I

462
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:19,629
drop my prop laughter and my stuff is

463
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,329
still tasting pretty good but right now

464
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,340
is kind of on the downslide and then not

465
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:27,159
this prop is coming in and we're getting

466
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:28,839
fresh and you know and then what we do

467
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,880
is we take that the stuff we didn't view

468
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:33,279
from the last year we'll throw it in the

469
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,330
freezer and make nice action bubble hash

470
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:40,389
of it we've been big proponents of live

471
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:42,279
resin back in the day we were actually a

472
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,530
couple months ago and we were cleaning

473
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,139
up before

474
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:50,490
5052 kicked into place all the same yeah

475
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,640
there's still some bags up from 20

476
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:57,720
2013 in there you know fresh frozen and

477
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,720
I will all be dipped

478
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,720
so we packed it all up in the machine

479
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,798
that we got fired

480
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,048
you know but freezing those terpenes

481
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,750
to get the best flavors and tastes you

482
00:21:08,048 --> 00:21:12,429
gotta you gotta freshman French fries

483
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,980
that stuff as soon as possible because

484
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:16,570
every hour those turkeys are

485
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,298
disappearing - disappearing and

486
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:20,529
disappearing and disappearing so if you

487
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:24,279
want to if you want to have the most

488
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:28,019
flavorful oils passes whatever you know

489
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:28,019
fresh frozen is always

490
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,710
I'm not too sure about co2 because I've

491
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,470
never really a big fan

492
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,940
but I never

493
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,740
realized how stupid each other each

494
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,570
other really works really well because

495
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,640
we capture of all those turkeys and

496
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:57,069
stuff and they're in a frozen state and

497
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,470
basically when you're when we're blowing

498
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:01,750
BHO you through the closed loop area we

499
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,600
froze everything we free the VA should

500
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:07,750
be priests of BHO these freeze the we we

501
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:09,849
freeze the steel columns with you know

502
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,099
with the lead inside I mean everything

503
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:13,658
was ice cold as possible when we were

504
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:15,668
raising concentration we always thought

505
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:17,730
the best the best place to do

506
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:19,559
concentrates would be like a super

507
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,480
air-conditioned

508
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:23,980
like a paint is where these paid guys

509
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,579
because all the air comes out the bottom

510
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,500
their site we all thought that would be

511
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:32,389
a really super safe place to do it in a

512
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,390
really great way this is a cold evening

513
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,558
yes yeah

514
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:46,980
and then the try thumbs up with that too

515
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:49,229
another thing time is that when when you

516
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,269
do comes are tinctures freeze the

517
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,980
alcohol freeze the Everclear freeze the

518
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,319
cannabis because you freeze the water

519
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,940
crystals and nothing you want is

520
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,220
water-soluble everything you want is

521
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,028
alcohol soluble alcohol doesn't please

522
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,579
so definitely it helped at 165 a pound

523
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:08,069
and Fred Meyers might dry ice and freeze

524
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:10,319
the cannabis of it you know a styrofoam

525
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:12,178
cooler for an hour with the Everclear

526
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,798
and you get a much different product

527
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,778
it'll be gold in it because you won't

528
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,700
get the chlorophyll coming out and when

529
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:19,859
you do shake it it give you 30 seconds

530
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,960
to three minutes with frozen Everclear

531
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:25,308
whether it goes golden to breathe stop

532
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,909
so yeah I'm a big freezer yeah

533
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:28,908
Eddie come out right

534
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,630
the terpenes came out we really started

535
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,430
taking it I mean it was probably like

536
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,860
three or four years ago out the markets

537
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,330
and all of a sudden true teens with a

538
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:43,159
big thing you know and how can we

539
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:45,500
capture a minute how do we get the

540
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,269
tastiest oilmen what do we need to do

541
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,640
and what we're all know all the tricks

542
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:52,609
you know everybody had their trip but

543
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,759
I'm like duh duh you know the way they

544
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:57,319
bath about you know he was like

545
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,970
conductive non conductive conductive not

546
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,250
could see all these layers of glass of

547
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,230
metal all filled with water you know to

548
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,569
get that perfect temperature to anything

549
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,059
capture those perfect turn feeds all the

550
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:10,599
process so

551
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:10,599
for a while but

552
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:18,049
now all they did was make a step our

553
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:21,019
game up so I really love the whole rosin

554
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,970
a nice ass nice a speedo and you know

555
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:24,829
and like it's a race to the bottom

556
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,990
there's tons of weed out there so I

557
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:29,839
think it's gonna be the future in our

558
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:33,049
eyes you know I mean that 37 cents a

559
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:35,449
gram to a dollar 50 or whatever it is

560
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:38,119
and then everybody said is going to go

561
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,529
down like an organ I don't I don't

562
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:41,119
remember what they're expecting but

563
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:44,019
organs going to be a massive and that's

564
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,019
that there's so

565
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,500
like as far as your eye can see many

566
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:56,800
places huge and they have no plaque

567
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,799
downtown it's like it's huge

568
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:12,740
you know so go in your former and

569
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,109
knowing where your product comes about

570
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,509
is a huge deal and that's why we all

571
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:19,819
here we love the girl around because you

572
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:23,299
know we've always believed Paul and I

573
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:25,460
that we have we're doing our collective

574
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,500
garden we always had pieces of every

575
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,809
something special for every one of our

576
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,910
patients in our garden because we

577
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:34,159
believe that they're energy needed to be

578
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,720
in the in the greenhouses with the

579
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,790
plants because we thought that the

580
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,940
plants are so into to be because

581
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:42,980
everybody grows I grow my own best me

582
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,490
everybody in here grows the best week

583
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,000
for themselves is that correct right

584
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,650
right

585
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,380
so the plenitude really I didn't even

586
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,960
blender lifted for and I believe

587
00:25:53,380 --> 00:26:01,260
everybody desperate the best plants blew

588
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,259
themselves for sure how to say yes

589
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:08,349
the ice has process okay sure so what we

590
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:10,539
do is we fresh breeze everything we put

591
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:12,459
it in brown paper bags and the brown

592
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:15,759
paper bags even in the freezer seems to

593
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,340
pull a little bit of the moisture out so

594
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,819
what we do is we'll take that handful I

595
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:25,389
use a

596
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:28,539
washing machine and and bubble bags so I

597
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,910
have a work bag that's a zipper bag it's

598
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,769
kind of like

599
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:35,529
the delicate laundry bag you know for

600
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:38,109
like uh the statins of almost fancy it's

601
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:40,389
basically that and it's about as big as

602
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:42,819
this and what we do is we like to layer

603
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,560
it will put ice on the bottom and then

604
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:46,929
will like you're working with the

605
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,700
whatever product of our budget or

606
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,230
whatever we'll put a layer of those and

607
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,059
we'll just layer it all the way to the

608
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:58,630
top so I have this baby zip

609
00:26:54,059 --> 00:27:00,190
no this regularize Gina and then what we

610
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,470
do is we take it and we put it in the

611
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,710
washing machine and then and then we run

612
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:10,029
it out 15-minute cycles to two cycles

613
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:13,480
and then we dump it into a set of bubble

614
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:18,049
bags which are like different meshes so

615
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:22,160
it goes from 160 to 72

616
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:24,589
20 to 25 and 25 is your full no ice

617
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,180
house you know it can be davon stuff and

618
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:28,179
then the

619
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,649
[Music]

620
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:52,250
four times so I'll keep that back until

621
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:55,400
all the ice is melted and out of that

622
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,529
thing and it's just canvas in there and

623
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,720
then way you take what you can do with

624
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:02,000
that byproduct is it's all fully usable

625
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:06,589
we'll take that product put it down and

626
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,509
I got a dryer like dehydrator and layer

627
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:11,599
it up and dry it out and then powder

628
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:12,829
eyes you got Kanna gaps already ready to

629
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,809
go

630
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:17,210
so we try to use the many of these

631
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:20,149
products as possible you know as we're

632
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,460
doing it so that's the hash then we got

633
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,350
in our bubble bags we lift them out and

634
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,819
then we put it over a five-gallon bucket

635
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:27,529
and then we get a little water squirt

636
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:29,240
long respect to squirt all the bubbles

637
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:31,129
out to you know they're just the product

638
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,620
and then we take it and we wring it out

639
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,990
really good and squeeze it we try to get

640
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:38,929
as much of the water as we can and then

641
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:41,210
it goes into our freezer where we have

642
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:44,240
all these little packets of chunks of

643
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:47,390
hatch and then what we do is we we

644
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,359
microplane fastening it so we'll take

645
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,520
Pizza tricks and

646
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:55,009
like a lemon zester and you got this big

647
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,680
block of hash that's frozen and will go

648
00:28:55,009 --> 00:29:00,410
like this and just powder it up all over

649
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,279
the pizza tray the whole pizza tray and

650
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,230
then we'll put it in cool dark room you

651
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,808
know and let it drive takes about a week

652
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:11,288
to dry and then we'll do is we'll scrape

653
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:15,119
all of that stuff up and then we'll put

654
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:19,000
it into little 25 micron bags

655
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:21,038
so silk bags and then we'll put it then

656
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,380
will squish with heat pressure you have

657
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,379
a little somebody getting some

658
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,538
and then we end up with else or so and

659
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:44,308
then we take it back at the end of the

660
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:44,308
like six or seven grams so

661
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:58,058
Tom I know that you only keep the top 18

662
00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:00,730
inches of the cola for yourself to smoke

663
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:02,678
you know and joints or whatever for

664
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,589
folks in the room who are not gonna make

665
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,990
a shot of it when you go through your

666
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:10,569
drying process a little issue because

667
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,400
you know last year we had a similar talk

668
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:15,329
was more commercial oriented that was

669
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,740
very focused on mandatory

670
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:19,779
humidity settings but like possible just

671
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,740
doing it in our house you know yeah so

672
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:25,109
what's like real DIY curing for well I

673
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,150
guess we

674
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:29,619
have some of those big humidifiers been

675
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,630
prior to bringing into the living room

676
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:33,639
had everything it's done in our in our

677
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,220
living room or our little storage shed

678
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,340
up there and

679
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,650
we bring it in and we hang everything we

680
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:44,079
have a little rotating bath and came to

681
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:48,679
everything and

682
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:51,349
we do that yeah be tear it off like that

683
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,519
and then from there like I said hang it

684
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:57,519
up there until it's

685
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,519
dry

686
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,799
that's kind

687
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:10,089
of

688
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:57,640
yeah we're happy boy your feeders so I'm

689
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:01,360
a EGIS [ __ ] I used fish and I use a

690
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,640
compost tea mother for organics makes a

691
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,979
liquid feedback and it's really good as

692
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,020
a human acid base and it's pretty much

693
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,269
an activator I like to use it with all

694
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:13,519
my different things but three times a

695
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:16,369
week I spray Monday Wednesday and

696
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,480
Fridays at 3 o'clock at hottest part and

697
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:23,769
day and we just go in there and we wanna

698
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,769
actual a one that hooked on

699
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,359
yeah

700
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:58,370
I don't see a lot of super benefits to

701
00:32:56,058 --> 00:33:00,619
it although those microti see on the

702
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:02,599
table here those things are Bob I'm the

703
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:04,788
big huge micro bad I mean we might grow

704
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:07,699
this heck out of everything and then we

705
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:10,759
molasses a lot will start molasses and

706
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,860
local asses you know we stopped Boston

707
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:15,829
about two weeks ago both in the last

708
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:18,229
heavy heavy heavy heavy and it's

709
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:19,970
microbes and molasses and then it's you

710
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,548
know we rotate the backwaters and the

711
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,298
sea guano's you know right right up to

712
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:25,298
the end you know

713
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,230
[Music]

714
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,130
well it could be a where I think burps

715
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:44,579
he could work pretty good too you know

716
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:47,940
and then these what one make it to

717
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:50,759
nitrogen-rich you know but it's the

718
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,400
fastest way to get the you know the

719
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,220
magic to movies like leather underneath

720
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,960
you know during the heat of the day you

721
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,460
know almost a bus or everything is wide

722
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,460
open have a just drain

723
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:06,119
underneath that's where that's where

724
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,159
they eat from don't feed it from the top

725
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,759
everybody all the plants feed from the

726
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,960
bottom so we from tomatoes to everything

727
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,960
we always go

728
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:23,610
[Music]

729
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,960
no no no is use fishin tea you know we

730
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,899
don't we don't I don't like to put

731
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,820
sugars on my leaders you know I the

732
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:31,819
sugars going the microbes are

733
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:51,380
[Music]

734
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,670
so

735
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,230
we'll just stop at then we'll just stop

736
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,930
like to eat least not like two weeks ago

737
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,269
and then they'll do one big water in the

738
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:08,159
end that's about it his at the end at

739
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:10,320
this time of year you want to cut back

740
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,219
on your watering because you really want

741
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,410
to force to finish as quick as possible

742
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:17,109
like this year's secret order so you

743
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:19,599
want to force them so he will quit water

744
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,910
em Konami and and they'll finish them

745
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,829
quick you know and then especially since

746
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:25,899
in the ground we have a lot of name you

747
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:30,719
know I will start getting brown water in

748
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,720
there too so in the end so I like to

749
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:36,910
always a road race either for us you

750
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,860
know we never really get to ideally

751
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:42,929
finished but they do a really good job

752
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:45,220
here good job because of the

753
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:47,559
fluctuations in the weather and the

754
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:50,619
temperatures and I also think that's why

755
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:52,719
not more in greenhouse cannabis you

756
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:55,299
taste so good never work so good because

757
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,759
it's out there in the nature you know it

758
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,660
gets all of those waiting changes it's

759
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,660
not a sterile

760
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,710
and I think the plant the plants were

761
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,960
your sponsor we're all about full

762
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:17,440
spectrum everything pulls back in soil

763
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,280
full-spectrum Sun we wanted all so I

764
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,720
don't really like the isolate those

765
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,019
sweet sure you can get really pretty

766
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,019
buzzed

767
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:36,299
[Applause]

768
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:47,110
after ice damage yeah it's after is

769
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:47,109
totally dry 16 days after that

770
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:04,489
oh

771
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:07,070
yeah yeah all that played golf the

772
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:09,589
canvas culture man when I got home

773
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:12,769
yesterday and I got yesterday morning

774
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:15,280
and I saw that one leaf go like this on

775
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:20,739
my beautiful

776
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,740
Obama Kush I said honey

777
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:28,039
so she kept everything ready and what we

778
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,289
do is we set up a whole living then she

779
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,420
categorizes everything we put everything

780
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,519
out hangers physical pieces of tape on

781
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,530
what she marks everything we marked the

782
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:39,500
day that we folded and we mark the

783
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,180
string that is on and then that's how we

784
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,820
kind of keep track of those blue

785
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:45,679
definitely take those onto the brown

786
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,210
paper bags we also like to ride

787
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:49,989
everything on the dice we can keep

788
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:53,528
driving very good so you

789
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:56,568
may be displeased

790
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:59,329
yeah I do a lot of topping them they're

791
00:37:56,568 --> 00:38:01,429
small so I can't write you know you know

792
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:04,220
poor big crowds coming on each one of no

793
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:07,940
one take those loss and then hang them

794
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:09,858
but my wife does I mean that's all she

795
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,170
does you know she heard the man needs a

796
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:14,778
haze when she all she likes me to do is

797
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:17,119
go to Home Depot and get the big huge

798
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:18,559
leaf bags you know and then she just

799
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,358
takes the whole thing of stuffing in

800
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,940
there and all she doesn't break it off

801
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:25,778
throughout the year is

802
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,778
we still do this day

803
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,809
well over the years you've expanded your

804
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,630
grill you have a lot of different types

805
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:47,369
of operations you've tried a lot of

806
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:50,280
different methods now with the reduced

807
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:52,730
numbers what is your preferred method

808
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,140
for the most amount of harvest or plow

809
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,929
most of my harvests per plant my

810
00:38:55,139 --> 00:39:00,359
preferred method

811
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:02,509
well well just bake huge holes because

812
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,090
the bigger the hole the bigger the plant

813
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:08,700
so we go jumbo holes and when you're

814
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,210
using a clone almost all those roots are

815
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:14,399
going to go laterally out to the edge of

816
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,470
pretty much where your canopy is so you

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,750
want to make sure I'm not a big fan of

818
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:21,889
super deep so I love wasting a lot of

819
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:25,260
swell literally I take the shuttle that

820
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:27,719
8 10 inches in pop it out we clean it up

821
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,930
and that's it I don't think big huge

822
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:33,389
pits if I don't use 3 feet of soil or I

823
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:35,519
don't do anything crazy I just we've

824
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:37,679
always gotten kind of minimal our plan

825
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,280
always look pretty good with what

826
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,279
everybody says

they're gonna you know if you want to

830
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,048
take the microscope out and look at them

831
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:24,020
you know like they're some of the

832
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:26,659
trichomes are amber it's like ideal you

833
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:28,940
know and or lighters a little bit better

834
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:31,159
you know the lighter they are the more

835
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,349
pop hiatus you know the work clearly on

836
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:34,848
the warm-up hiatus so it all depends

837
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:37,490
what you know kind of what you're living

838
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:40,640
for the deeper than amber so you can

839
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:42,828
take a really superior and cook it to

840
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:46,639
the end so it's all nice marijuana stuff

841
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:48,920
will put you out I mean it's all a lot

842
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,969
of it to the trichomes of how hot more

843
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,970
you take that plan

844
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
yeah

845
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:53,550
and then like I said we just kept any

846
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:56,289
response to his death

847
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:59,610
and then we just get them so we keep the

848
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:02,170
big leaf separate from that step two so

849
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:04,559
anything any of those small user testers

850
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:09,159
down they go

851
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:10,570
that would go into main aspect and if

852
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:14,920
you want to do other things with you

853
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:17,430
want to try and I don't know do whatever

00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,430
you could

and then I'll bring it in the house

00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:43,109
next three days and then move on to dry

Northwest Freight or something like that

878
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:47,269
it's a farm supply store if you put them

879
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:49,130
in there and it hooks up to the

batteries on your on your little mower

pulse it up so

pretty good power that's not a nice

break ideally for that what you want is

887
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:21,820
you want a farm so they have like these

888
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:25,309
still foggers that are of course

889
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:27,980
applying fertilizers and what any kind

890
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:31,070
of thing you want to plant by plant you

891
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:33,019
can get in there and that if you really

892
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:37,150
do that's the ideal way because you

893
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:39,889
can't coverage full 100% covers oh

894
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:42,079
no it's a big mess you know you probably

895
00:44:39,889 --> 00:44:44,629
want to wear a mask because you'll be

896
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,730
breathing it in but but besides that it

897
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:49,970
works really good you know oh and

898
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,679
another with this year to get rain you

899
00:44:49,969 --> 00:44:54,439
could shave your plants but works really

900
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,649
good as a leaf blower I take a leaf

901

blower

902
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,720
and you want to save your plant and

903
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:30,260
sure they went out shook but there's too

904
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:34,028
much moisture and there's a little

905
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,028
pocket some that are starting to pop out

906
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:41,990
you know if you see any problems I can't

907
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:43,809
stress in that as soon as you see that

908
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:46,909
problem take that thing down like

909
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:51,079
instantly one spot on your plant you see

910
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:53,509
my rules one week lips over and the

911
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:55,039
whole plan is down because they can't

912
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,520
take seven percent your plan today

913
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,930
because that's good and you don't even

914
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:02,750
know if you got it the first thing you

915
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:05,419
saw it the first day so it's a for me

916
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:07,219
it's a rate you know I didn't work you

917
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,730
know like in years before we would start

really never have any spider life

problems at all and it's Tuesday like

super dry hot arid you know and we have

all this voice to know every morning is

927
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,920
do everywhere and there's just too much

928
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,069
moisture and there's really no reason

929
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:42,369
unless unless somebody brought the buds

930
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:44,380
in or they brought the less it might sin

931
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:47,500
then you're not that you shouldn't have

932
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:49,720
any problems so and we've been really

933
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,550
open with our farms and thank goodness

you know we really haven't had any

935
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,880
problems the only problems we did have

936
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:57,069
was a few years ago we brought some

937
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,349
plants in from California and they had

938
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:01,769
breast breast advice but it was also a

939
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:04,089
year I was doing 90 plants out

940
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:06,130
and I thought we had all the rest of my

941
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:08,140
taken care of way earlier we didn't

942
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:10,180
really have a problem but then I saw

943
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:12,460
this weird truck drive up and down this

944
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:14,949
beautiful County vehicle had this weird

945
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:17,409
box on the back and I think there may be

946
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:20,399
some sort of baby-making be spreading

947
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:23,440
you know spread Andres Alliance

intentionally the to damage their crops

949
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,829
I suppose first turned up in California

950
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:33,009
and probably not

951
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:35,259

Cottonwood area said the helicopters

953
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,760
flew over and within four days they

954
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,980
dropped us the plants and knocked out

couple things else you don't want your

they're not Delaney beetles the little

964
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:15,599
yellow ones and then you don't want the

965
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,310
white butterflies they go around you

966
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,659
know they're kissing all the time and

967
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:20,880
they want to land on your pad where

968
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:22,859
every time the 11 or but to land ahead

969
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,269
and you're going to get but allowed to

970
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:30,590
the next so you wanted this time of

years are like my mortal and

972
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:41,319

00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:16,269
yeah we make guys a shot of them both

983
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,730
both of them yeah we make us a shout

984
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:21,159
everything it's it's quick it's easy

985
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,929
it's inexpensive we're not using any

986
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:24,549
hydrocarbons we're not using anything

987
00:50:22,929 --> 00:50:26,829
dangerous sounds really not anything

988
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,690
they could say about it you know any of

989
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:30,309
the authorities and it's a better

990
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:34,210
cleaner process I mean all you're using

991
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:37,230
is ice cold water ice and ice cold water

992
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,230
and heat and pressure

993
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,630
the cold water

994
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:50,629
why

995
00:50:55,429 --> 00:51:01,289
no no we microplane we squeeze all the

996
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,079
water up and then we put in the freezer

997
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:07,108
and then that way it stores really well

998
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,630
so we're ready to use it we microplaned

999
00:51:07,108 --> 00:51:11,670
it out so it's fluffy because we know

1000
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:14,849
there's no moisture than that and that

1001
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:17,220
we tried to squeeze it like straight out

1002
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:20,730
of the freezer we take a chunk off there

1003
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:22,409
we go Wow now this point drop it so what

1004
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:25,650
happens with the heat pressure starts

1005
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:27,920
boiling in the water blows out the side

1006
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,920
of the

enterprise you

1009
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,420
know

1010
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:03,149
the best thing you do is put them in a

1011
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:07,349
keep them in a full choir hit those big

1012
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:09,990
huge bags from Home Depot those big you

1013
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:12,359
know a big paper bag with long lead bags

1014
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:15,269
put it in there that'll keep it

1015
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:17,809
regulated it will slow it down it'll

1016
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:20,550
regulate it too and you won't lose it

1017
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:23,789
so you don't want to don't ever put

1018
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:26,130
anything in any plastic never not even

1019
00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:29,239
in the freezer you know we're all about

1020
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:31,329
paper and stuff like that

1021
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:34,519
race itself it makes it not so

1022
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:38,319
you know sensitive because you must pass

1023
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:38,320
the back you build up that moisture that

these draft plans that are

1028
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:22,460
what we do these

1029
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:27,769
facts that the bugs really like so like

1030
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:31,829
it's a bug world

1031
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:34,879
green beans like flaming younger you

1032
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:37,769
know and then eggplants like beat

1033
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,349
so between between filet mignon and

1034
00:54:37,768 --> 00:54:42,118
bacon you know these bugs are stuff go

1035
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:44,130
after the green beans and look go after

1036
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:47,099
the eggplant before the dark your campus

1037
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,869
plan all day long and eggplants are

1038
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:50,940
super effective because you go to itch

1039
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:53,630
lady's garden you look at the eggplant

1040
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,539
but egg whites always been their part

1041
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:59,519
it's a delicacy to so we do this instead

1042
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:02,190
so maybe you wanna travel and stuff

1043
00:54:59,518 --> 00:55:05,068
organic companion plant and then the

1044
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:07,460
elements work pretty well too you know

1045
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:10,619
swimmin

1046
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:12,960
and we every separate our garden from a

1047
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:15,630
canvas dirt by long distance because the

1048
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,818
bugs like that and the squash come on

1049
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:20,390
they like hang out the best in car so we

1050
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:20,389
give them their

I mean I really haven't tested that les

1053
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:41,700
is a bunch of new products on the market

1054
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:43,920
they don't give it a test product issue

1055
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:47,429
well I've got a pretty successful you

1056
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,490
know generally like it doesn't taste so

1057
00:55:47,429 --> 00:55:51,929
good my next crop comes to themselves

1058
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:53,729
it's kind of a wash then we can make

1059
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:56,730
whatever we want out of the what's left

1060
00:55:53,730 --> 00:56:00,240
over so if you're doing this fall you

1061
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:02,059
know bro ethical bro or whatever you for

1062
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,739
plans whatever your lab

1063
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:06,690
that's

1064
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:08,129
you know I was I would start them and I

1065
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,309
will try to give them and pay them as

1066
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:14,369
low as you possibly can to fly you know

1067
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:16,849
and so there's some laws are some

1068
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:16,849
interesting
