1
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,460
Wow that's just incredible setup and you

2
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,710
know some I come here I was born three

3
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,949
things one make sure you have great

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,939
shows the first thing I look at this

5
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,679
category it's actually it's all this

6
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,219
this stuff that you know more the

7
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,219
Denmark

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:45,390
Andrew you don't have coffee it is that

9
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:48,539
- so how many people read this book if

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,090
you have this book right now - Amazon or

11
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,469
somebody else this is my second book

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,930
taking the nutrients and now I have a

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,420
meeting with one giant horse needs a

14
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,350
three boasted - trilogy and that makes

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,350
me Lord of the Rings

16
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:12,349
years ago Canada's here before campus

17
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:23,310
plastic appeared out of nowhere and and

18
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,649
we started to eat plastic this is what

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,719
partner it is and we played with plastic

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,460
and we had a vision fertilizers of

21
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,650
appeared out of doors today using you

22
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,139
know horse manure and this great stuff

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,460
leaves people spraying these foods we

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,280
wouldn't have blemishes on it they

25
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,859
invented you know instant coffee and we

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,228
had a small D better living through

27
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,239
chemistry and we had a television

28
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,679
channel there were only three stations

29
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,799
and one of the choices

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,600
was mr. wizard and he was on and he

31
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,629
would talk about science and he had his

32
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,169
little baby assistant sponsored by

33
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,170
General

34
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:12,469
and you knew growing weed because the

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,290
light was always purple coming and this

36
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:17,629
is the original Purple Haze and you will

37
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:25,459
be whatever you could grow but nobody

38
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:28,129
else would find it and when you grew you

39
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,319
know is mostly sticks and still rules

40
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:33,530
and scenes and it was not very good

41
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:36,798
queen election had a PhD in chemistry

42
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,629
and you can do economics and it required

43
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:41,659
me to be in chemistry in order to be

44
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:43,609
able to do economics now today we don't

45
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:47,989
have a little oil of anything you know

46
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,950
instant popcorn over one of our TV

47
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:54,259
dinners this is our instant coffee

48
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:55,629
counters we won't have tall homes we

49
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:58,899
carry around

50
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:02,379
in our telephones magazines and there

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,650
come on it's just the curl world but we

52
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:08,199
still you know rely on chemistry

53
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,980
very often when we're growing and

54
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,409
particularly if we're growing

55
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:13,959
commercially and we have an

56
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:16,780
overabundance of reliance on chemistry

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,629
and relax and unfortunately gardeners

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,990
and some cannabis gardeners in

59
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:25,810
particularly now we spritz them because

60
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,950
impractical and we want to say well you

61
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,170
know it's kind of crazy

62
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:30,969
what kind of minute of marijuana as

63
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:33,280
Mataji was playing in the chemistry you

64
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,729
know it just doesn't make any sense to

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,460
me

66
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:38,799
and you know it's not the moral and it's

67
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,870
not ethical to be bringing something

68
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,810
that you're selling or giving away a

69
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,670
family member or a using yourself that

70
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,580
has a chemical dominican girls like you

71
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:51,459
do it's just not for us not ethical it's

72
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,030
absolutely not right some things are so

73
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,550
obvious it don't really be the same so

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,789
why is my stand because we're going to

75
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,890
have big pharma you know who else coming

76
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:05,319
down our butts and they're going to be

77
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,399
definitely things a different way than

78
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,159
we think it wouldn't be able to

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,469
distinguish ourselves by being the clean

80
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,560
green

81
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:16,629
not a big corporate stuff so our goals

82
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,639
today are figure out that it wasn't

83
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:21,730
really amazing cannabis easily without

84
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,969
using chemicals and using the soil

85
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,189
whatever to be able to do it I can get

86
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,350
them all talk about the slide as well

87
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,110
who both involves plants taking

88
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,620
photosynthetic energy and using it not

89
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:57,670
to produce the but not to release the

90
00:04:35,620 --> 00:05:00,910
Judeans but reduce the treeless of one

91
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,160
of those Japanese food and so they

92
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,810
reduced the rate under 60 days which

93
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,000
they drip out of the roots piece of

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,370
their roots this is the roots of what

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,500
most plants [ __ ] actually paid out and

96
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,170
it produces in order to be able to

97
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,500
attract Japanese bacteria so this is in

98
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:22,120
fact Japanese these bacteria eat these

99
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:27,509
exudates and they can turn are eaten by

100
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:31,060
them and they poop out the excess and

101
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:33,459
that excess contains that Japanese food

102
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,759
that goes to the plant same thing with

103
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,498
the fungus down there

104
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,939
japanese material or attempting to

105
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:40,249
polish there's a lot of the garden pool

106
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:43,189
the plant would change the exit date

107
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:45,229
itself to produce a different kind of

108
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:48,349
molecule to attract a different kind of

109
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:50,478
food so it's it's it's self-control so I

110
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,098
want American performed well it just

111
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,199
changes the it to date because American

112
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:55,639
food you should be thinking to sweat and

113
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,120
and think about extra days because your

114
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:02,050
affection dating right now your sweat is

115
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,379
attractive bacteria and Punjab and

116
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:08,418
they're attracting ozone you're covered

117
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,999
with roses so if you disappeared write

118
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:13,098
down your shapes would stay here because

119
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:14,809
of all the chromosomes that are I mean

120
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:17,019
it sounds like fun until you see some of

121
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:20,059
the pictures of you in a couple minutes

122
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:22,998
this particular picture called exit

123
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:27,110
gates happens to be kind of actually

124
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:29,028
that's the dental white blood cells so

125
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,460
not only go out to get you know get

126
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:35,058
tracked bacteria but these guys go out

127
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:39,288
and they lock up things that the plant

128
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:40,639
doesn't want to take off like arsenic so

129
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,389
these actually dates to do some pretty

130
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,278
amazing thing

131
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,468
and of course it's bacteria Monday they

132
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:47,088
all contain antibiotics and whatnot and

133
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:50,478
so there are no all sorts of things in

134
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:52,098
the soil fascinating fascinating the

135
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,889
plants trying to get the largest and the

136
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:59,050
most diverse population that can't

137
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,050
that's what protects the plant diversity

138
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:29,240
diversity because diversity populations

139
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,549
in control center get center and again

140
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,829
god help the republicans if they don't

141
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,319
understand they're in a teaspoon of good

142
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:39,228
soil there should be 500 billion to a

143
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,120
trillion bacteria and archaea now

144
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:42,800
bacteria you know is what i had the

145
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,968
first edition of the book second edition

146
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,408
of the book pet archaea because that

147
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:48,528
didn't know they existed in the first

148
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:50,478
edition was written these were only at

149
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,978
the oceans they were only in geysers and

150
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,348
now they discovered they're in the soil

151
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:57,139
now they discover that the dominant in

152
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:59,658
the sec organism the second step of the

153
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,009
nitrogen fixing the you've never heard

154
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:04,069
of them because they were discovered in

155
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:06,860
1878 and and making textbooks until 1898

156
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,240
is the third branch of life our team

157
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,979
they look like bacteria that ever

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,889
different a different thing you look at

159
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:15,560
month these guys over the bacteria

160
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,900
needed sugars and they break them simple

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,490
to digest that it's the ends of long

162
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:23,459
carbon molecules and that

163
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,019
bringing in a breathe it's a to bacteria

164
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,969
it could have been a petri dish ideal

165
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,490
condition to six weeks later the earth

166
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,710
is covered with 20 feet of bacteria now

167
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,610
you know they're unbelievable and they

168
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:38,189
formed a slime in order to colonize and

169
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,538
to present themselves and to communicate

170
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,300
with each other

171
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:45,958
and this slide is very very important to

172
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,000
what we do because the slime think about

173
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,559
brushing your teeth in the morning

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,240
you're brushing off the bacterial slime

175
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,359
you're all licking your teeth right now

176
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,009
it's okay when it doesn't you use a lot

177
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,589
of energy to get that smell off because

178
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:02,659
it's really strong follow bacteria

179
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:06,839
talking to each other and producing a pH

180
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:09,899
above 7 so if our soils have bacterial

181
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,600
dominance then they have a pH of of 7

182
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,730
and have all of the slime which sticks

183
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,830
to little individual particles before

184
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,769
and causes them to stick to each other

185
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,230
so soil structure and create to come

186
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,509
from bacterial slime this is where it

187
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,320
starts and then that he's personally at

188
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:30,328
14 feet of invisible one behind 14th we

189
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,028
can't see it but it's there and those

190
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:35,599
invisible from Ivy you know local thing

191
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:38,039
that they're exactly like plant cells

192
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,980
fungus people understand take a minute

193
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,860
or studying

194
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,620
they don't have that little chloroplast

195
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,159
in there they can be given a chlorophyll

196
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,610
and then through those that currently

197
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:54,709
stuck together pieces of soil and making

198
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,600
a bigger intolerance of soil and their

199
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,030
bricks these things are getting stuck

200
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:05,149
together they've got you know pore

201
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:07,279
spaces so we get pore spaces air the

202
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:07,850
bigger guys the grains they hold the

203
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,370
border

204
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:14,330
this is business soils talking bacteria

205
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,759
and fungus Unum and these bacteria they

206
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,550
digest extra severally by tripping

207
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,230
enzymes gasses out of their bodies

208
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:23,839
breaks their little stuff when they take

209
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,940
it back into their bodies so when they

210
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,120
dominated in the soil instead of having

211
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,240
a pH above 7 we have a pH below 7 and

212
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,700
they are unbelievably strong acids here

213
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,399
is a fun play the great Indian twosome

214
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,500
have some fellows work to get some of

215
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,490
the nutrients out of that rock therefore

216
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:47,629
not and they go out some and bring back

217
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,340
new trees for the plant in return for

218
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:52,189
those accidents some of them just decay

219
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:55,220
stuff break things down some of them

220
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,020
actually attach essentially to the plan

221
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,480
and remix it and those are the

222
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:01,309
mycorrhizae fungi and they bring that

223
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,550
phosphorus and nitrogen in zinc and

224
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:06,119
copper in Africa

225
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:08,629
Romanies you and water to the brain and

226
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:13,549
if you don't have your plants dolphin

227
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:17,669
96% of all plants for Michael mediation

228
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:20,000
symbiotic with these funds and cannabis

229
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:23,458
happens to be a very very big

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,669
partnership former so here's how they

231
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,049
work

232
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:26,789
you got two celiac sitting in the

233
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:28,769
someone who says he's had to make a

234
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:30,809
little bit of baloney today baloney

235
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:32,940
sandwich would be really nice and so

236
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:35,399
what does it do well that goes and mixes

237
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,050
up the exudates okay this is got to get

238
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,089
the right actually date it puts the

239
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:41,370
extra these out into the soil

240
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:45,089
alright catches the right fungus and

241
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:48,060
then the pointless reels it in and the

242
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:49,829
fungus one end of it goes into the plant

243
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,149
there's the entry point unbelievable

244
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:53,149
picture just spectacular

245
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:05,509
okay be ready and these days it's so

246
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:10,969
easy it's

247
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:14,139
you let me do this oh sorry Bridget back

248
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:17,090
because the plate says hey don't want me

249
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,980
no extra days and so it's a perfect

250
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,560
relationship and they're both very happy

251
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,610
and what's even better is there it isn't

252
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,159
the bologna sandwich

253
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:32,210
we'll see link very happy it continues

254
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:34,779
to nurture this relationship and what's

255
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:40,639
nothing cool is that it shares

256
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:42,500
mycorrhizal associations and plants next

257
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,710
to each other even if they're different

258
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:53,120
kinds of plants america than a redwood

259
00:12:45,710 --> 00:13:04,160
tree sometimes it's not always what we

260
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:05,629
do and how we do pretty amazing now

261
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,759
there are seven different kinds of

262
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:09,409
mycorrhizal one's right there are two of

263
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,240
them an important to agriculture and

264
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:13,309
there's only one that we care about

265
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,990
it's an indoor bike rifle which means

266
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:19,609
that it's invisible you can't see it

267
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:22,399
less you stain it in endo these ends of

268
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,909
those traits in the room more than the

269
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,870
ecto which is the other kind and this is

270
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,909
what they look like when they're

271
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,259
insights we buy my third book you can

272
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,929
read all about all this boring as

273
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:35,569
possible dogs not very exciting but you

274
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:36,528
need to understand is that what you are

275
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,620
for me

276
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:42,559
is a mycorrhizae or Michael rise up my

277
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:46,278
rising world and what's farming it is a

278
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:49,609
set a root settle and a Michael kreizel

279
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:52,039
function so you are not buying Michael

280
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,220
rise up and if they're selling product

281
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,599
this label Michael rise up your label to

282
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,579
grow you're selling like the rise with

283
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,409
one giant and Michael rise up is the

284
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:02,328
partnership between the foot tell you

285
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:05,568
the rule that forms when you put the

286
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:07,638
mechanism down okay craziness and here's

287
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:10,128
what you have one that associated

288
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,339
cannabis feels like it's an investment

289
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:15,199
secular and it's or micellar the secular

290
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:17,240
person as these little practice though

291
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,938
grounding there is a little vesicle

292
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,490
contains liquids that that's where the

293
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:26,480
transfer takes place between this will

294
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,370
get at the plant and then tree-like

295
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,889
structures that are ocular so it's

296
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,470
called the secular and about our brush

297
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,089
dealer buys the fungi these are uh still

298
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,249
looks like little trees they're inside

299
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,860
the cells can't see unless you sustain

300
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:41,389
them so here they are stinging now is

301
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,899
the problem is the problem in our

302
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:46,720
endemic so we know as an emulator Isaac

303
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:51,470
relationship it used to be called

304
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,420
Verizon fancier than it has 50 different

305
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,550
engines on all the different labels that

306
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:58,219
you pick up because they keep renaming

307
00:14:55,549 --> 00:15:00,620
the damn thing and finally we've gotten

308
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,278
to the point where we know that DNA and

309
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:06,500
so from now on it's called Bryce Vegas

310
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:09,558
interests CDs and that he ranked them

311
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,049
one thing other than remember to buy all

312
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:14,899
the worldly routes books soon as this

313
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:16,609
talk right now lots of things into

314
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:19,578
proceedings because this is the stuff

315
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,379
that makes your cameras parole well and

316
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:23,379
I'm talking really well and if you want

317
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:25,500
a different one just for fun

318
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:28,539
see some wonderful pictures Google Wow

319
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,070
Michael rise and you'll see the kind

320
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:32,139
that I've been using lately these are

321
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,940
the old means almost lost equal material

322
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,439
errors as a Vegas everyday only nervous

323
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,420
about me to be free other ones but

324
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,370
impressive things in to receive these is

325
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:41,139
what you want and if you want to see

326
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,549
anything else on the label you're going

327
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,159
up and rich you're wasting your time

328
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:47,409
because this is the only one that forms

329
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:51,149
the partnership with the Kennedys there

330
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:56,500
is a vibe a big point there is a need

331
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:58,419
from the lab test that I did wow that's

332
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,299
a big plan well they don't get the sense

333
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:02,709
of how big that is maybe you don't give

334
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:05,759
a sense how that is he putting on a

335
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:08,769
gigantic frying pan that's not a little

336
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,610
so it was Wow right turned out

337
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:14,649
unfortunately

338
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:17,350
oh man plants can't wait to get sport so

339
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,959
yeah it's a big big big difference big

340
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,670
difference you could've stopped on the

341
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,660
scenes we should want to infect the

342
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:27,250
plant right away scenes if you can if

343
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:29,769
you mind homes you put it on right away

344
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,289
as soon as you get it you get it has to

345
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:34,899
touch the roofs there's a communication

346
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:37,689
from the plant to the mycorrhizae fungi

347
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:39,429
this is poop over here and so they've

348
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,590
got to be there you won't find it in

349
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:44,319
compost you have to add it to your soils

350
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:47,220
and you want to put it not only on the

351
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,359
seeds but in the soil mix it around

352
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,359
[Music]

353
00:16:54,729 --> 00:17:52,308
well this is its drought situations they

354
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:54,139
use that water to feed the plant as

355
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:55,878
people discovered until only three or

356
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:57,949
four years ago there was a gigantic job

357
00:17:55,878 --> 00:18:00,769
and they those that didn't use my

358
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,700
grassle fun tonight lost their crop

359
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:06,200
those that did have them but they

360
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,149
provide protection for things like

361
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,450
nematode for a couple reasons first of

362
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:14,449
all they're coated with because they're

363
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,950
fungus they're cold with a kite okay

364
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:20,910
how did you think about you know

365
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:25,860
and a hamburger hamburger

366
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:27,690
coated with you know gonna take the

367
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,789
hamburger without the shrimp because

368
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,370
it's easier to eat easier to get through

369
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:35,279
this provides some protection you know

370
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:36,689
and of course Michael has a fun day that

371
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,369
white stuff is pretty hard to get

372
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,240
through to get that stuff you got that

373
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:44,459
slime okay so it creates a PAH they also

374
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,660
have their own Rises if you're kind of

375
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,940
thing it's called a microsphere

376
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,040
and so then that can own sort of soil

377
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,660
food that they're feeding all sorts of

378
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,879
organisms knocking down the whole front

379
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:58,980
I see what you're doing stuff now

380
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:06,350
so in fungus slide the bacteria slide

381
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:08,430
the pH above 7 slime for fungus below so

382
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:09,990
two different kinds of Slingbox

383
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,630
so here's what's going on in this one

384
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,960
you've got you know all this bacteria

385
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:21,140
fungi being attracted by the enzyme

386
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,140
insides the M there's the dead bar I

387
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:29,839
being the attracted by the exudates

388
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:33,620
and they in turn attract the for the ZOA

389
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:36,139
we eat them and the nematodes that have

390
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:39,769
been pulled out the excesses me blankets

391
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,559
been I'm out of this pool turns out to

392
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:46,069
be a form of nitrogen ammonia okay

393
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:49,910
fallen always but if you have nitrogen

394
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:59,119
fixing bacteria they take that in turn

395
00:19:49,910 --> 00:20:02,169
it into so and it's going to take that

396
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,459
stuff and turn it into thank you

397
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:06,559
so the fungally dominated is going to

398
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,390
stay is upon you and if you've got

399
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,500
funding to plants that like lovely

400
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:15,020
nominees as soils they need that and

401
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,980
other plants they like nitrates both of

402
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:18,589
the place that way that clearly

403
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:22,038
dominated soils well guess what cannabis

404
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:24,558
like bacteria technology disorders so

405
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:28,220
you want to use things that attracted

406
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:32,808
the bacteria okay and the masses and

407
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:36,169
nowheres follows this company stop right

408
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:39,200
soils why use cover crops that didn't

409
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:41,000
make it to fixing cuz that's really good

410
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,558
stuff helps to plan

411
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,558
this happens to be some stuff that you

412
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,528
can

413
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,240
follow whatever little bit of focus you

414
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:50,878
don't want have just pure bacterial some

415
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,528
of these plants have fun give some sort

416
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:55,709
of structure oh and then I mentioned

417
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:58,378
that they've recently discovered that

418
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:01,829
these bacteria they talk to each other

419
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:05,089
using electricity in this new stuff that

420
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:09,119
people keep talking about called

421
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:09,658
terpenes and talking toppings wait a

422
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,329
minute

423
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:14,249
they just like us so they communicate in

424
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:20,418
turn to each other like a net big tip

425
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:24,089
there anyway here's a little Free Syrian

426
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:27,269
speaking to one identify bacteria using

427
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:29,759
turkey as theirs as their language so

428
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:31,230
you've got fertilizer bags okay the

429
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,960
bacteria the fungi

430
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,929
they've been attracted by the action is

431
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,819
simple this is and they're then eaten

432
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:41,580
and scrap metal fertilizers feathers

433
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,678
protozoa and nematodes so let's take a

434
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,349
look at the part is over this is an

435
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,090
amoeba nobody we said they saw on my

436
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:51,868
always you class but nobody ever did so

437
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:54,109
against the picture and this protozoa

438
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:56,359
that everybody did study

439
00:21:54,109 --> 00:22:08,089
they assume you forgot didn't you that's

440
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:10,879
the name come on Paramecium each one of

441
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:13,548
these Paramecium will be you 10,000

442
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,429
bacterium addiction and then poop out

443
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:18,019
the excess that's a lot of food a lot of

444
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:21,169
these guys you've got tremendous amount

445
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:24,769
of food so am I gonna think about a Zola

446
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:27,139
T to cite them with anterior that you've

447
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:28,700
done in your soils that's last picture

448
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,439
is what they look like I'm not going to

449
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,919
respond but they look like an electron

450
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:38,720
microscope anyway t it's easy you just

451
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,970
take strong or a cobra protozoa put it

452
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,319
into a bubbler or just put it in a

453
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,240
bucket of water stir that through three

454
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,339
times a day after two and three days

455
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,740
you'll be able to see the pepper BC

456
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:52,009
running on in there after ten days of

457
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,538
the soil their site I'm like man alright

458
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:55,339
then you have never told us you got the

459
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,859
40 or 50 nematodes in that teaspoon of

460
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:59,388
soil you know somehow we're good also

461
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:00,949
berkeley doing it for white they had

462
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:03,048
never told us in the customer good ones

463
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,639
the bad one have to support these little

464
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,158
things we get inside the roots their

465
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:09,019
plants turn yellow you know they are

466
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,750
differentiated by their mouthparts

467
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:13,849
and you know this one is one

468
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,460
probably don't want that at my kitchen

469
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:18,589
sink but that's just sort of a broker

470
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,170
spatula that's not a drill and it's just

471
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:23,179
waving water in bacteria into the mouth

472
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,830
this is the one you want to worry about

473
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,410
other than workers it sticks straight

474
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:30,429
into you and then sucks out a lot less

475
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,720
than your body this one attacks dogs

476
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,180
cause it's awkward so other than that

477
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,789
now they're kind of fun these are some

478
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,580
of the benefit ones they can attack the

479
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:42,529
bad guys they get in here they get a

480
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,299
little bacteria the bacteria start to

481
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:47,389
grow inside the bad guy the eggs that

482
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:49,399
they lay inside at and then they eat the

483
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,680
bacteria meanwhile the bacteria has been

484
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,210
eating the bug in the munich gets really

485
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,259
ugly they leave and they always make

486
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,539
sure they take a little bit of the

487
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:03,430
bacteria weather so that they can repeat

488
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:03,430
what they need to do with attachments or

489
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,970
negatives so that they really work and

490
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,370
you get the right ones and there's lots

491
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,298
of them being studied now and it's

492
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:18,668
certainly something you want

493
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:19,900
all sorts of things you can see these

494
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:21,850
things by being something called

495
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:26,350
overlays a funnel which is just

496
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:28,029
basically made it but it's in the book

497
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:30,279
and you gather these things these are

498
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:32,259
soil organisms they're taking those

499
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,089
bound together particles of soil and

500
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:37,119
they're moving between them creating

501
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:39,129
colors as they run through as larvae

502
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,859
States in there even slowing each other

503
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,320
and all this stuff it's unbelievable and

504
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:46,209
these tunnels act as air spaces and pore

505
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,189
spaces and hiding places and when it

506
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,950
rains the band is pushed out the waiter

507
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,890
comes in so again soil structure it's

508
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,590
all about the soil food web it's not

509
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:59,950
about you or me it's about what the soil

510
00:24:56,589 --> 00:25:01,959
you ever study they say dog-eat-dog

511
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,659
things are getting eaten then they're

512
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,490
getting eaten again and pooped out and

513
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:08,530
eat and poop out and eventually ends up

514
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,779
there the bacteria the fungi and

515
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:13,000
eventually if a plant surrounded it once

516
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:15,579
that kind of food it goes into the plant

517
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,200
so you got all sorts acutely going on

518
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:19,490
down there it's just you know it's like

519
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,710
Congress

520
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,940
fights in there different kinds of mites

521
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,769
and you want to know the difference

522
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,320
between the orbited the ganas in length

523
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:29,269
because one of them eats fungi and you

524
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,519
know one of them eats plant material and

525
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:32,839
so if you had once and eat the fungi and

526
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:38,240
you know you've been fine giant in your

527
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:41,119
soil etc all the stuff is killing things

528
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,519
and very terrible stuff he's almost gone

529
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,898
you know and then of course is that the

530
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,139
base of things that are in the soil food

531
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:49,939
bears poop in the woods that whole part

532
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,059
of the soil food web that bears

533
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,288
organisms as well food web I start from

534
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:56,509
repeating this of those have heard this

535
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:58,730
talk that's my window a date with Alaska

536
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:01,278
if you look carefully not so carefully

537
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,659
you'll see that we do is open and you'll

538
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,038
see that there's just a screen there

539
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:06,350
that bears looking in through the screen

540
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:08,480
you see a little crease and neck pushing

541
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:12,069
here that's where my head was at

542
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,069
nanosecond my wife

543
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:23,069
see you outside the window an angel -

544
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,450
ima see you loose begin they poop in the

545
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,509
woods you know that's all part of the

546
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,730
soil for you that you mama and you watch

547
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:36,569
one spring I happen to catch a pair of

548
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:40,140
calories I'm sorry Tina

549
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:42,419
I'm sorry okay now we do other things to

550
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,650
the soil you know you have to be

551
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,960
thinking about it so one of the things

552
00:26:43,650 --> 00:27:20,580
we were trained to do day one was going

553
00:26:45,960 --> 00:27:22,019
to soil structure is up here and of

554
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:24,389
course we do things like we spray we

555
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:25,529
start having problems and you know who

556
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,570
knows what the state is they're in

557
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:33,379
pieces visit school so we go and seek

558
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:33,379
expert advice at Lowe's or to American

559
00:27:39,398 --> 00:28:10,148
you know like this in terms of the soil

560
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:37,959
because I'm getting the stuff for free

561
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:41,350
it's my garage - I thought he didn't

562
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,600
either so it's the plan until it's out

563
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:50,199
of Poland and you're there you go holy

564
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:54,219
[ __ ] the plants tiny and it's everything

565
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:59,590
because you guilt and now you have to

566
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:02,170
become that means this is supposed to be

567
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:05,230
fun this is supposed to be easy money

568
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:07,870
right develop that's what the technical

569
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,789
companies attacking us so anyway I want

570
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:11,168
to stop using these chemicals to create

571
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,599
these situations we've ended with no

572
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,220
partnerships dependency and of course

573
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:19,959
that you start getting diseases because

574
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:22,750
once these things start to go what do

575
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,769
you do what the might goes back and it's

576
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:34,230
really easy to do if you use compost you

577
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:34,230
can use T's mulches and you can use

578
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,929
compost as everything okay

579
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,579
you buy that amount of the compost this

580
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,259
over the area going with now the part to

581
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:50,980
take a look at and you're going to end

582
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:53,079
up with no mycorrhizae fungi because

583
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,319
it's not in compost you have to get that

584
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:59,609
it's only there the plant sends out the

585
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,609
signals for plants in the

586
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:51,449
with culture they will tell you the

587
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,620
compost tea is all prod the Cooperative

588
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,440
Extension Service isn't allowed to

589
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:57,778
mention it because I kind of receive

590
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,140
them so whether they know I always say

591
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:02,159
that the Cooperative Extension Service

592
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,860
that's the president of Harvard

593
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,929
University that's that's their first to

594
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:09,148
count push team machine and they have

595
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:13,070
about ten of them now they turn the

596
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:13,069
entire campus in your green space

597
00:31:14,028 --> 00:31:19,819
everything they have know how they

598
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:19,820
compost including their exams

599
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:25,269
and enough power it's good enough for me

600
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,669
and you park your car our yard your

601
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:29,769
party your card accomplice teacher now

602
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:31,299
you use compost tea and you can make

603
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:33,639
bubbling up it in and they're clearly

604
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:36,190
government and it is protective stuff

605
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,840
and it's one wonderful and if you don't

606
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,370
have the time to make compost tea and

607
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,158
there's lots of different kinds of

608
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:44,288
Grover you can make your own you can

609
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,240
make compost extract well incidentally

610
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:48,490
it was a Brewers here they're just

611
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,900
protecting both over here synergy and

612
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,970
over here there's one of the biggest

613
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,340
ones I've ever seen absolutely

614
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,509
spectacular you can make an extract I

615
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:59,199
just simply take the compost and

616
00:31:55,509 --> 00:32:05,490
cheesecloth just in water for 15 minutes

617
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,490
and I kind of multiply it together

618
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:14,619
Austin takes away ground but you get

619
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,409
good stuff out of that column so it's a

620
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:20,889
great way to go as well green stuff is

621
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:24,940
good for you know bacteria the brown

622
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:28,690
stuff was good for function cymbals

623
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:31,750
Network the enemy is to increase the

624
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,490
fight Michael biomass now there are two

625
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,079
things I've learned since I spoke here

626
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,759
last year the first one we're talking

627
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,369
about right now it's all day might won't

628
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:41,200
buy all the leader and inventions I go

629
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:43,469
with a biomass and you've been looking

630
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,470
up at

631
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,510
might put biomass we want the creeks the

632
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,400
second thing we're going to talk about

633
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:54,460
at the end of my talk here and it's

634
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,620
gonna make it kind of light but you know

635
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,049
my hopes all the nutrients they cycle

636
00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:01,239
the nutrients they they recycle the

637
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:03,250
nutrients and so if you have high

638
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,309
microbial biomass you get all things

639
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:08,470
considered and of not plowed soil for

640
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:10,089
the poop but if you have normal song

641
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,950
that you're growing into infinity good

642
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:15,939
stuff to it you just like over the

643
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:17,860
biomass it has over 500 is great it's

644
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,730
over 800 you don't have to clean the

645
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:23,889
soil holy crow and if you remember when

646
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:26,440
the biomass drops when the plant stops

647
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:31,860
producing extra days right before it

648
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,759
starts so you can go ahead of your time

649
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:36,429
money anyway

650
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:39,849
biomass very very important and you know

651
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:42,420
you want to have big healthy plants good

652
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:43,839
biomass in your soil you've got the best

653
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,060
opportunity

654
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:59,199
Tricia's plants good turkey in your

655
00:33:46,059 --> 00:34:01,899
plans big plans this is my second book

656
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,210
you know and we tend the rest is

657
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,310
building so every time you think about

658
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,010
going to see we down that see we they

659
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:10,210
feeding plan it's got 56 different

660
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,649
nutrients in it they're all the eight

661
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,869
ten of them are feeding their plan

662
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:17,819
that's the only one of the plant beans

663
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:19,940
now in the US again they had seen me is

664
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,550
the micro

665
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,220
the plant and so in that regard very

666
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:28,669
good very healthy you know 17 18

667
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:30,678
elements if you play cards with that but

668
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:33,918
if you do the combination it turns out

669
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,418
you know that it's like 56 zillion

670
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,568
trillion different kinds of molecules

671
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:42,500
can be made by various combinations you

672
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:46,009
know they're all made 1,400 nutrients 5%

673
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:48,800
of the stuff that you peel the rest of

674
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:57,050
it 95% of what is in a plant water

675
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:59,269
oxygen carbon you know the specials

676
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,420
each channel designed for one kind of

677
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:05,780
molecule each channel made by every

678
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:08,150
individual cell themselves each channel

679
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,010
sometimes only two or three molecules to

680
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:18,318
come through like Borg it'll be very

681
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:20,450
very boring before the flower so they're

682
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:23,179
feeding their plants this these are the

683
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:25,489
only things that may be kept this is the

684
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:26,719
III Corps of all the nutrients and how

685
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:29,899
they get into the plastic

686
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:32,299
things but the soil we have creates is

687
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:38,720
impeccable biomass so that those

688
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:40,220
nutrients are available all the time you

689
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,868
know it all starts with those actually

690
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:44,509
days that the plan puts out you're

691
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:46,608
feeding microbes we're going organic

692
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,410
you're not feeding the plant and you

693
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:56,659
kind of concentrate on those microbes as

694
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:59,029
much as possible okay so the end game is

695
00:35:56,659 --> 00:36:03,289
that biomass you want to make sure you

696
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:05,450
test your soils okay because we know the

697
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:07,219
least amount is missing is no one's

698
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:09,799
gonna screw you up because that really

699
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:11,389
you can't guess by looking at don't

700
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,640
think they know by looking that they

701
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:15,588
believe your plant needs nitrogen that's

702
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,568
[ __ ] there are a hundred different

703
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:20,539
reasons why a planetary the yellow

704
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:22,219
leaders okay just happens to be nicer to

705
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:23,960
someone that's easy produces upright

706
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:25,219
about as good as a gardener and our work

707
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,039
it's crazy

708
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:30,439
test your soil biologically so who

709
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,900
whether in other places do you wrote a

710
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,460
micro bio meter test and get a chemical

711
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,889
test to that you need to know what's in

712
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,480
it okay these cells are important and

713
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:41,809
what goes on to these cells depend on

714
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,789
what in that sort in their billions of

715
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:48,929
these cells like in this little period

716
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:52,529
right here and five to fifty plant cells

717
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:54,539
tomahawk you know not here you know

718
00:36:52,530 --> 00:37:00,510
these are small these are really small

719
00:36:54,539 --> 00:37:03,269
next lines but anyway this how many

720
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:06,510
atoms are in an individual plant cell

721
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:07,800
estimating that plant cell and so each

722
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,480
one of these apples you don't realize

723
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,860
all the stuff that you're giving it and

724
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:19,349
we don't ever think about these things

725
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:21,539
with all the noise it's okay inside

726
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:23,159
every single cell of a plan there are a

727
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,710
thousand different kinds of things

728
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:28,289
owners now remember they're totally

729
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,789
simply doing it help atoms in there

730
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:31,860
there are thousand different kinds of

731
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:34,889
it's a ten thousand each one of them is

732
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:37,410
just lonely in every single cell them

733
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:39,119
unbelievable in terms sure is like crazy

734
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:41,699
from not so that you can follow a

735
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,069
training that we go around the earth you

736
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:45,989
know thirty million car trained over

737
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,880
there hundred twenty times that's how

738
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:49,319
much sugars but these every white planet

739
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,640
it's just a staggering number

740
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,420
the only thing that comes close all

741
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,420
those k-cups

742
00:37:55,159 --> 00:38:01,159
unbelievable but they work best at 78°

743
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,539
that's why your glands work best at that

744
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,129
temperature so you want to keep it at

745
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:07,550
that temperature you possibly can

746
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:20,030
no mostly will be perseverant keep the

747
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:27,789
temperature at 19 is 78 degrees but you

748
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:34,940
only can do this stuff just because I

749
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:37,039
want to kick the screen soil is make

750
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:40,070
sure it's clean and pure organic as

751
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,079
smell nice that smell is Chloe's from

752
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,930
the substance being produced by

753
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,489
streptococci a bacterial the kind of

754
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:49,669
stuff that we use in medicines it's

755
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:52,489
called goe that we're sailin ever a

756
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:54,920
pupil it's a condominium for the soil

757
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:57,109
food so you would have very best we

758
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,720
possibly can a nice mix wanna make it a

759
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,950
beautiful condominium a Sloan

760
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:02,868
condominium

761
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:05,000
you know not a word ricotta media we

762
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:06,769
want to make a luxury condominium for

763
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,030
the best stuff you want to want to fill

764
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:10,280
up with the rate things are gonna be

765
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,510
able to take care of the pests okay you

766
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,010
want to keep them under control

767
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,210
biologically if you can them you're

768
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,820
going to be thinking about consumption

769
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,710
out competition interference and

770
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,588
reduction

771
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:26,260
okay got faith like a soil for many and

772
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:28,400
this isn't the questions you have to ask

773
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:31,339
and you ask yourself these questions

774
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,190
because you can answer them you won't

775
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:36,139
have problems anymore yeah not that easy

776
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:39,079
they require a little bit of work but

777
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:41,569
you need to do it we've got competition

778
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:44,900
coming down the road but you cannot

779
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:49,088
believe and get those people Harvard

780
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,088
we're using that compost tea for there

781
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:57,320
so we've got to be the top of this stuff

782
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:58,909
right now you know we have it's not

783
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,640
necessarily be taking the bad problem

784
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:04,338
you know trips gotta go that vanilla

785
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:06,858
might work you know little vanilla track

786
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:09,289
for example be clever about how we do

787
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:14,809
this stuff and use the right nights for

788
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:17,539
my little business to sell these women I

789
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:19,789
have used the right kinds of stuff for

790
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:22,279
each one and we have to we have to pay

791
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:24,380
it's solvents sometimes they come and

792
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,880
teach us how to do this stuff and when

793
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,460
we have a bad end of the station

794
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,619
yeah the commander bring them in so that

795
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,318
they didn't tell us what we need we need

796
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:35,510
to be using cover crops to add to the

797
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:39,199
soil too many of us might throw in our

798
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:42,140
soil they each grow oh my god just have

799
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,960
all that time making good soil then

800
00:40:42,139 --> 00:41:56,129
what's in the

801
00:40:44,960 --> 00:41:59,420
or even because it's outside and you

802
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:01,309
never speak greatly

803
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:07,309
I'm here to Hannover for god sakes and

804
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:09,260
take notes and helmet Konishi you want

805
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:12,680
to soak up as much of this stuff as you

806
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,750
possibly can use that rascal [ __ ]

807
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:18,108
it's just absolutely

808
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,088
Wow all the reason he discovered it is

809
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:21,920
that he discovered himself ability

810
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:24,710
discovery but he discovered that it

811
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,019
would be too big competence and he won

812
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:32,809
the International pumpkin contest two

813
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:34,548
years unbelievable it needs the right

814
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:36,048
lights and we're going to be talking

815
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:39,469
about lights just for 2 minutes at the

816
00:42:36,048 --> 00:42:42,139
end here my friend sinned and can't show

817
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:44,659
you a new Michael a plasma white most

818
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:47,118
efficient endeavor and the reason why

819
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:50,960
I'm excited about it because thus far is

820
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,660
the best let's base organics and so what

821
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,389
goes together pet no I mean it's it's

822
00:42:53,659 --> 00:43:01,009
just the way it's supposed to happen and

823
00:42:55,389 --> 00:43:03,529
the LEDs and the HIV to be no they don't

824
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:05,210
this new mask the lighting never seen a

825
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,519
plastic like you're about to see one

826
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:10,909
today five minutes anyway when I think

827
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,619
the right stuff I particular tension to

828
00:43:10,909 --> 00:43:15,170
what your stuff does to the other stuff

829
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:18,019
so when you use a light is that might

830
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:20,659
open your books for these herbs it might

831
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:23,119
be actually open but breathe it might

832
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:25,308
actually be killing off our lovely place

833
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,528
do that so there's a synergistic effect

834
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:29,269
of all of your stuff together gotta stop

835
00:43:27,528 --> 00:43:33,858
with the amenities this video will be

836
00:43:29,268 --> 00:43:35,328
IDM no do you use IBM worklight usually

837
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:38,498
the right things that enhances it so

838
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:38,499
it's a whole different thing

839
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:54,108
it's just what fun is fun to use bucks

840
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:55,879
to watch a praying mantis you know bring

841
00:43:54,108 --> 00:44:00,108
your cheesy they get them pulp what

842
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:05,559
you're doing and the pervasive teeth it

843
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:08,719
all never thought cell banks that straw

844
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:11,329
cover there's definitely use they don't

845
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:16,009
have microbial biomass eventually the

846
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:18,140
Bible you know by a microbial leader and

847
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:21,228
that you want to use compost working

848
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:23,838
possibly 10 and blames compost team and

849
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:25,909
runnings the right knowledge is so Brown

850
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:29,659
villages are for fungal breathing

851
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:32,778
launches of artwork cameras these people

852
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:34,608
just go get your grass clippings your

853
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:35,869
plants when you take them that bill

854
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:37,009
Plante if you're not going to use the

855
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:40,548
leaves for oil

856
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:45,528
I got he was right there on the plant

857
00:44:40,548 --> 00:44:46,300
you're growing gee willikers reuse and

858
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:48,760
recycle

859
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,890
those extra days those excellent plant

860
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,630
spends fifty to sixty percent of its

861
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:56,440
photosynthetic energy producing those

862
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:58,539
entities it's in the soil throw it out

863
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,139
this good stuff

864
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:05,110
yeah and test it test let me say the any

865
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:06,639
test the most I'm not going to ask

866
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,390
because the last time I did it another

867
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,389
soul

868
00:45:07,389 --> 00:45:12,940
I was soldered by people afterwards they

869
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:15,969
were embarrassed nobody raised their

870
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:18,730
feet as many people your test you've got

871
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:20,500
a text okay that's good that's good so

872
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:23,769
there's the bio ever tested Samantha

873
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:27,599
left so that test you know even cosmic

874
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:30,280
tips why because informations power

875
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,670
information is power and you're stupid

876
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,340
if you don't get that information so

877
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:39,659
information is power

878
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,660
what's nice is instead of plants

879
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,890
outdoors plants to our plants it doesn't

880
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,980
matter whether they're inside or outside

881
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:53,109
in fact you know we're getting the point

882
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:55,150
where I hate the Santa Canyon or wrong

883
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,430
it was something that most of our son

884
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:00,460
likes the way that you're going to be

885
00:45:56,429 --> 00:46:03,460
their bigger facilities so nice like

886
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,590
this you know and so who would like this

887
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,570
make a tremendous amounts of sense so

888
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,690
you definitely use you want to use

889
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:13,480
Google Google is the Canada's grow his

890
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,889
best friend but you know Donald Trump is

891
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,960
great at one if they occasionally

892
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:20,879
there's smoke in the victims on Google

893
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,880
you know playing Flushing

894
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:33,349

you know so you read my bucket doesn't

896
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:37,340
seem to make any sense to flush with you

897
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:40,070
really understand what happens in that

898
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:42,230
cell and you see those little channels

899
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:45,740
with it nutrients go in and things come

900
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:49,090
out of it wait a minute how could it

901
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:51,379
possibly work it doesn't okay you know

902
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:54,460
it want to use Google because of the big

903
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:57,650
bad guys sorry

904
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,960
basically get anytime we want you know

905
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,700
you also carry a cell phone you're out

906
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,070
there in the vehicle looking at your

907
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:08,989
plan to do something wrong don't wait

908
