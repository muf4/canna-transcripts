2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:10,050
the more I learn about cannabis plants

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:12,419
the more I understand the complexities

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,309
of designing cannabis gardens one of the

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,048
first things I had to rid myself of was

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,419
the belief that everything I already had

7
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,489
learned was correct true learning in any

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,500
field necessitates that I remain willing

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,989
to adapt my understanding when presented

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,118
with new information no doubt this is a

11
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:29,729
challenge we see on cannabis forums and

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,618
social media threads all the time folks

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,719
argue vigorously and even get angry

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,909
defending what their mentor taught them

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,460
even though there isn't any reproducible

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:40,169
support for their relief similarly I

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,439
often think that I know what I'm talking

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,960
about

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,640
only to find out I do not on shaping

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,230
fire I'm very careful with the kind of

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,299
information I spread because I know

22
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,759
folks trust me to not repeat [ __ ]

today's an episode that makes this most

24
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,839
clear to me I thought I was building an

25
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,429
interview about why banker and trap

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,160
plants were so important to the garden

27
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:01,469
and which ones to choose well I was I

28
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,448
was wrong if you want to learn about

Shango louse today my guest is

63
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,919
entomologist Suzanne Wainwright evans

64
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,300
also known as the bug lady suzanne

65
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,280
graduated from the University of Florida

66
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,410
with degrees in both entomology

67
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,969
environmental horticulture and has been

68
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,219
working in horticulture for more than

69
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,770
twenty eight years and in cannabis since

70
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,689
normalization began her focus has been

71
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,939
on Biological control and using

72
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:27,990
pesticides properly she has worked

73
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,430
throughout the United States and

74
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,439
internationally consulting to

75
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,989
greenhouses nurseries theme parks and

76
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,150
gardens she is without a doubt the

77
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,590
preeminent cannabis pest expert in the

78
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,250
United States and is a sought-after

79
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,539
speaker for cannabis events everywhere

80
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,759
while I thought today was going to be a

81
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,090
guide to the best plants to use and why

82
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,439
trap and banker plants were so essential

83
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,539
instead we're gonna learn about trap and

84
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,060
banker plants in depth while also

85
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,919
realizing how hard they are to use the

86
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,659
complexities and challenges of using

87
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,089
them in the cannabis garden why the

88
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,949
plants suggested so often on forums

89
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,959
don't actually work in real life and

90
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,089
finally some strategies for making

91
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,469
banker and trap plants work for you if

92
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,310
you're willing to put in the effort

93
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:13,169
welcome to the show Suzanne oh thanks

94
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,330
for having me so thank you so much for

95
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,159
being here so let's get right to it you

96
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,579
know a lot of people throw these terms

97
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,109
banker plants and trap plants back and

98
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,549
forth they use them synonymously in a

99
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,799
lot of ways and then they kind of put

100
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,689
them all under the category of companion

101
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,340
plants so what I want to do is tease

102
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,870
these apart so they can we can really

103
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,640
understand how to use these more

104
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,789
effectively in the garden so would you

105
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,639
start by defining what banker plants are

106
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:42,509
and what trap plants are and how they're

107
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:47,069
different so basically the idea of

108
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:49,289
banker plants is a food source for your

109
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:53,519
beneficials an alternate food source

110
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:56,069
then what you want them to feed on in

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,079
the crop one of the most popular

112
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,409
popularly used ones right now in

113
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,170
ornamental production is the aphid

114
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,659
banker plant system and the idea is that

115
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:10,649
if you release these tiny parasitoid

116
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,329
wasps which kill a foods if you just

117
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,859
release them and you don't have many

118
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,889
aphids in your greenhouse they're all

119
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,600
going to die because they can't they

120
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,009
don't really have a food source and have

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,019
a place to lay their eggs so what you do

122
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:24,240
is you provide this plant and on the

123
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,209
banker plant you're actually providing a

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,650
different a fat species so it

125
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,719
it's kind of a complex system that you

126
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:33,599
have the plant and you have a pest

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,919
insect on the plants but what's crucial

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,990
is is that you have to make sure that

129
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:40,680
those pest insects in this situation

130
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:44,598
these aphids don't move on to your

131
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,220
primary crop so it's kind of a way to

132
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:51,149
maintain a population of your

133
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:54,449
beneficials without actually having the

134
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:56,668
pests in your crop at the time so we're

135
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:58,590
able to use like an aphid banker plant

136
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:00,209
system and then we also have one for

137
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,478
aureus which is the minut pirate bug

138
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:05,008
we're able to use that to build

139
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:08,159
populations of beneficials in the

140
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:10,199
greenhouse before the pests arrived so

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,460
you already have the standing army of

142
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:18,810
beneficials ready to go also they can

143
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:21,448
provide food that your crop necessarily

144
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,579
can't provide because when you look

145
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:26,280
again at aureus the my new pirate bug it

146
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,649
needs pollen in its diet and most crops

147
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:32,189
do not have readily available pollen or

148
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:34,228
the right kind of pollen and so by

149
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,228
providing the pepper plants we're

150
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:39,689
providing a pepper a pollen source that

151
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:42,360
aureus really love so that they can

152
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:45,300
reproduce successfully the flipside of

153
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,110
that are trap crops and they do kind of

154
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,750
exactly what they say is they trap your

155
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,098
pests there's actually been some really

156
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,529
good research done on this and

157
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:58,050
unfortunately in some situations it's

158
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:02,869
not been very successful but the idea is

159
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:06,090
is to plant a crop that is tastier than

160
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:11,218
the the plants you're actually growing

161
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:13,978
and to try to draw the pests out of the

162
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:17,098
the crop you're growing into the trap

163
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,810
crop some people will then either bag

164
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:21,089
these plants and remove them other

165
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,649
people treat them with a pesticide so

166
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:26,209
that when the pests feed on them they

167
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:28,978
die again there's been work trying this

168
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:30,930
one of the more famous studies was done

169
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:33,269
up in Canada and they were looking at

170
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,310
poinsettias and eggplants for white fly

171
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:39,838
management but unfortunately the the

172
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,129
white flies were just way too happy on

173
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:42,569
the poinsettias

174
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:44,338
and they wouldn't leave to go to the

175
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,239
eggplant even though eggplants a really

176
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:52,889
good host for white flight also so it's

177
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:56,188
it's not it's not that common as seen

178
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:58,319
the trap crops as banker plants because

179
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:00,689
the thing you also have to be careful of

180
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,559
is if you put out these plants and

181
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:03,569
you're growing let's say all these

182
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:06,719
eggplants to try to pull white fly if

183
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:08,729
you don't take care of those trap crops

184
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:11,819
it basically can turn into a pest

185
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:13,829
breeding system and I see that happen a

186
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,598
lot with banker plant systems too people

187
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,359
forget about them people ignore them and

188
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,788
then like and the banker plant systems

189
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,908
the pepper plants then become breeding

190
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:27,959
grounds for a fidex so these are

191
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:31,918
programs that you have to stay on top of

192
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:34,168
you can't you can't just plant them and

193
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:38,758
walk away because you do have to treat

194
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:41,908
these plants for pests crops I mean for

195
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,689
pests insects and mites all throw in

196
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:45,868
there also

197
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:48,300
there's also insectary plants those are

198
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:51,899
plants we use that provide pretty much

199
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:55,069
pollen and nectar for beneficials that's

200
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:59,338
a term that's used a bit more outdoors

201
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:02,249
when you you know plant you know plants

202
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:04,408
around like well alyssum is one that's

203
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:08,219
used calendula things like that that

204
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:11,098
provide pollen and nectar for the

205
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:13,288
beneficials let's dig into the banker

206
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:15,418
plants off first because you caught me

207
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:17,908
off guard I actually never realized that

208
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:23,758
folks who have got a good program are

209
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:27,569
actually uh I don't know pre charging

210
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,149
their banker plants with an Associated

211
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:33,028
species for example like your example a

212
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:35,729
an aphid but not an aphid that

213
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:38,458
necessarily prefers cannabis plants so

214
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:42,689
they are creating a food source for in

215
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:46,409
this case the the wasps and but but the

216
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:48,688
the species of aphids that they are

217
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:51,750
setting up on those banker planes are

218
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:53,429
actually not one that is harmful the

219
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,019
cannabis do I understand that correctly

220
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:58,259
yes so

221
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:01,289
on that particular system we generally

222
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:04,740
use barley some people use oats but

223
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:06,299
basically it needs to be a type of grass

224
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,250
there's again there's been studies done

225
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:11,969
looking at what works the best and

226
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:14,460
barley produces the most a photonic and

227
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:18,120
it's the bird cheerio if it is the

228
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:22,980
species we use and it is it's a feeder

229
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,500
on monocots so it won't move to

230
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,070
dioecious plants it will stay on grasses

231
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,409
so if you are a grass grower you would

232
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:35,430
not use this system but if you are

233
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:38,039
growing not grasses you and I you know

234
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:41,120
there could always be one weird example

235
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:43,500
but generally you're okay so you know

236
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,049
again if you grow in just seeing as no

237
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,250
we don't use this in those and also

238
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:51,629
there can be some issues with some

239
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,620
lilies but so far as to date we have not

240
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:57,899
seen the bird cheerio David actually on

241
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,929
cannabis and so that way you're rearing

242
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,929
these aphids and this particular system

243
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:06,599
only works with a Phidias coal money

244
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:09,269
there are several different a fat

245
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,480
parasitoids but this particular system

246
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:15,809
is for coal money which a coal money

247
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,899
will parasitize things like cotton

248
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:22,049
Melanie fit and it does also parasitize

249
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,939
the cannabis aphid is it the magic

250
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:25,620
silver bullet for cannabis aphid no but

251
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,170
it definitely is part of the management

252
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,299
program for it yeah and overall

253
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:33,329
integrated pest management in the truest

254
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:35,250
sense yes yes one of the thing I find it

255
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,040
interesting that banker plants actually

256
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:42,169
have got two very distinct roles that

257
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:45,389
not only can they be pre-charged with an

258
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:47,399
associated non pests that can feed your

259
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:49,740
beneficials because I think all of us

260
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,049
who have used beneficials in the past

261
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,210
have run into the problem that when the

262
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:56,459
beneficials do their job and suddenly

263
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,320
the pests numbers are down suddenly

264
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,900
there's no food source for them and they

265
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,100
either die or wander away but then also

266
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:08,269
secondarily since the banker plant is of

267
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,259
a type that the pests also likes

268
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:14,629
pests are hopefully moving over to the

269
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:17,120
banker plants as well so so not only are

270
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:19,970
you providing a secondary food source

271
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,379
for them so they stay alive your

272
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,060
beneficial stay alive but also it

273
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:29,360
creates a secondary environment that's

274
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,649
not your cannabis yeah but I would never

275
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,490
depend I don't think it's ever really

276
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:37,009
with the barley it's not really going to

277
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:40,519
pull any of your pests from your

278
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:43,669
cannabis now on the pepper banker plant

279
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,429
systems because you know anybody's ever

280
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:48,589
grown peppers know the Western flower

281
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:50,539
thrips love them onion thrips can get on

282
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,580
them spider mites can't get it on them

283
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:55,579
several Avett species can get on them I

284
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,509
mean peppers could possibly function in

285
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:01,970
a way as a trap crop but and it was

286
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:03,970
funny I was just talking to another

287
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,129
researcher about this the other day

288
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,310
oftentimes when an insect is raised on

289
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:14,870
one plant it's very difficult to

290
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:17,329
transfer it to an alternate host that it

291
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:20,419
even though we know it feeds on it it

292
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:24,620
tends to want to stay on the same plant

293
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:27,469
species that I grew up on and often it's

294
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:30,740
Prodigy too so again this is why I you

295
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:36,680
know I'm trap crops not completely sold

296
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:38,480
on it for four key pest we're dealing

297
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,949
with I would say in cannabis and

298
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,850
ornamentals I'm not talking about

299
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:47,030
agriculture or other settings but it's

300
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,649
it's it's something that you really

301
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,720
would have to really work on and

302
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,919
generally again it's too much work for

303
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,680
most people to deal with

304
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,069
yeah well the the research alone to make

305
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:01,339
sure that you're fine-tuning your

306
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:03,379
alternative pest and also you know pre

307
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,389
charging them they mean this is

308
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:07,549
certainly a commercial scale you know

309
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,750
you know the commercial folks who are

310
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:11,240
listening and they're probably getting a

311
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,110
lot of value out of that but that's way

312
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,810
beyond what a you know a state medical

313
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,970
grower or a personal grower probably

314
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,739
going to use so are you saying that if

315
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:25,220
if our pests are

316
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,620
growing up on cannabis and they have

317
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:32,000
grown up eating it and so therefore they

318
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:35,240
like it that in in most cases using a

319
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,269
trap plant that we perceive is going to

320
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,210
be tastier than cannabis might not

321
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:44,360
actually be an effective that that folks

322
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:47,509
in cannabis are using these trap plants

323
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,889
but it's really not a solution it's more

324
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:51,259
of an ornamental solution than a

325
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:53,960
cannabis solution well until the

326
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:56,509
research is done and we know for sure

327
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,820
it's hard to have an answer and also

328
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:01,789
let's take for example bean plants bean

329
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,890
plants are one that we started doing

330
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:07,429
some stuff with actually in roses

331
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:09,740
outside and because spider mites love

332
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,179
bean plans if you want to raise spider

333
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,500
mites like well raise them sometimes

334
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:14,659
here at the house you know I'll raise

335
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,039
them on bean plants that's one of their

336
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:20,809
favorite food sources when we were using

337
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,089
them in roses is like okay as soon as we

338
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:24,829
see spider mites on the bean plants

339
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,930
outside we know they're common on the

340
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,270
roses so then is when we would start our

341
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:31,339
predatory mite program interestingly

342
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:34,730
enough we found out that it turned out

343
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:37,070
to be a better indicator plant and

344
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,440
that's really what an indicator plant

345
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:43,280
lets you know when a pest is in an area

346
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,450
because it indicates to you that it

347
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,620
actually worked out better for flea

348
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,240
beetles because the flea beetles would

349
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,250
actually hit the beans before they would

350
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,629
move into the roses so it actually we

351
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,470
learned something from that situation

352
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:56,750
but you know I sometimes wonder you know

353
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,910
if we have these bean plants out how do

354
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,179
we know that's just not a separate

355
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:03,769
population breeding on the beans then

356
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:06,769
what's actually breeding on the roses

357
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,990
and are those two spots spider mites in

358
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:12,319
the beans going to move in to the roses

359
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,269
and we don't know until there's study

360
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,030
done with a control it's hard to know

361
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:19,970
but again the number one problem I see

362
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:22,279
over and over and over again is someone

363
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,529
forgets about the bean plants they get

364
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,179
busy doing other things and then next

365
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,669
you know you have bean plants covered in

366
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:32,209
webbing and you know they're infested

367
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:34,429
with spider mites and a little late it's

368
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,810
a little bit your indicator was probably

369
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:39,809
10 days ago

370
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:42,199
and again I I see that happen and the

371
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:46,109
other thing and I just had a situation

372
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,850
with this in a Maine where somebody

373
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,610
contacted me freaking out because they

374
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,740
had EFA's all over their foliage and it

375
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,810
turns out that they were using a cover

376
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,029
crop and this is this happens all the

377
00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:00,629
time in cannabis losing cover crops

378
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:04,529
indoors and the cover crops turns into

379
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:07,409
just a breeding ground for all kinds of

380
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:09,149
insects and if it's often will you know

381
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:11,009
if they're not happy or the populations

382
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,750
get high but they'll pick up and leave

383
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:15,929
and they'll start walking up the

384
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,460
cannabis plants so in that situation the

385
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:19,349
aphids weren't doing any damage to the

386
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,730
cannabis they were just out looking for

387
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,649
a new host coming off the the cover crop

388
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:29,490
which some people are using air quote

389
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:32,399
cover crops as either banker plants or

390
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,200
in Sector II plans but they're not

391
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,220
paying attention to what other potential

392
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,350
pests they could get so as far as

393
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,570
indicator plants go I understand that

394
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,060
there's a lot of specificity from one

395
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,420
pest to another but are we lucky enough

396
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:50,849
in cannabis that there happens to be an

397
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:52,439
indicator plant species that is similar

398
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,540
to cannabis perhaps that's a little

399
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,030
maybe sweeter or tastier for these

400
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,279
plants that we may be able to plant

401
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,069
alongside our cannabis that would draw

402
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,699
the pests first and we could keep an eye

403
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,930
on those before they hit the cannabis

404
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,699
well it depends on what pass and you

405
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,380
know if you look at right now what our

406
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,120
major pests and the stuff that I get

407
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,550
contacted about every single day you

408
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,599
know cannabis aphid hand-press it might

409
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:22,349
root a food those their cannabis

410
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:26,698
specific they don't live on alternate

411
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:29,279
hosts at all now I have been contacted a

412
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,759
lot this year about thrips now thrips

413
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:36,930
because again a lot of what I'm finding

414
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:38,700
our onion thrips which I will consider a

415
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,870
generalist you know I hate when they say

416
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,580
the name onion thrips because everybody

417
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:43,319
assumes oh it's just a pest of onions

418
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:45,750
but that's not necessarily true because

419
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,879
there are a problem in ornamentals there

420
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,019
was just a survey done in Canada and

421
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,420
something like a quarter of all

422
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:54,089
thrips found in the Niagara region where

423
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:57,539
onion thrips over Western flour so

424
00:17:54,089 --> 00:18:00,769
they're definitely around but you know

425
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:04,889
again are they going to want to be in

426
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:07,200
ornamental pepper over the cannabis we

427
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:11,280
don't really know and also remember the

428
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,590
immature insects cannot fly so all you

429
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,200
can do is pull adults you can't pull

430
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:18,599
eggs you can't pull immature mites can't

431
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,960
fly so you really can't pull mites

432
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:26,429
either so really again this could only

433
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,140
be for flying adults and it's possibly

434
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:32,630
you know they've already on your crop

435
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,830
laid lots of eggs I just I just see

436
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,660
growers trying to do a lot of this stuff

437
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:40,129
and I don't to say they get in over

438
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:43,259
their head but we don't have enough

439
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:46,380
specifics yet and enough research yet to

440
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:48,809
support a lot of that and growers have

441
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,270
to stay focused on maintaining these

442
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,490
plants which tends not to happen again I

443
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:56,609
was at a facility out on the west coast

444
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,109
earlier this year and again we have

445
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:59,609
banker plans you know the peppers

446
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:01,469
they're sitting around I'm like well are

447
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:03,269
you putting aureus on them and they're

448
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,860
like no and I'm like think get rid of

449
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:07,109
them you know because again they're just

450
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,939
a breeding ground for broad might

451
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:14,099
Western flower thrips onion thrips

452
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:16,590
spider mites you know a fado if you're

453
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,209
not going to do the program let's double

454
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:21,059
back to the interesting comment you made

455
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,799
about cover crops indoors because of

456
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,019
course poly culture is becoming

457
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,480
increasingly popular both outdoor

458
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:30,680
cannabis growing and now indoor and

459
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,970
there are some great examples of it

460
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,160
because of course the you know having

461
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,110
these other species of plants not having

462
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,960
them the mono crop is really great for

463
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:41,519
the rhizosphere and for you know the

464
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
plants to be able to communicate and

465
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,990
share nutrition and all this great kind

466
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,240
of stuff but but you're suggesting that

467
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,059
these these these indoor cover crops are

468
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,490
also a potential threat will you speak

469
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,409
to that a little bit more yeah well I'm

470
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,339
gonna say this and I've said this a

471
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,310
million times

472
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:02,369
you know when growing indoors is not

473
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,889
like growing outside and outside when

474
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,500
you do cover

475
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:08,590
crops you know you've got the natural

476
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,089
ecology the natural soil ish I'm giving

477
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:11,529
you air quotes on that natural soil

478
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:12,039
because we all know soils been altered

479
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:15,910
too much

480
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:18,399
you also have thousands of insects and

481
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,529
mites that can move in naturally and

482
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,920
help keep things a little more in check

483
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:27,639
when you enclose yourself into an indoor

484
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,610
grow that sealed up it is nothing like

485
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,730
outdoors you don't have rain wish which

486
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:36,369
washes pests and bugs off of plants you

487
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,319
don't have again parasitoids just flying

488
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:40,719
in you don't have all these different

489
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,119
beneficial showing up and basically do

490
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,130
you put up a giant wall against

491
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,799
beneficials getting in

492
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:50,320
and so when pests get in that's why they

493
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:53,470
go really crazy indoors because there's

494
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:57,129
nothing really to control them and

495
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:00,100
that's again kind of the issue inside is

496
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:03,310
because a lot of these cover crops have

497
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:05,469
complex pest systems and people don't

498
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:07,029
think about managing pests on them so

499
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,350
now essentially you've got two crops

500
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:10,000
you've got your cannabis and you've got

501
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:11,799
your cover crop you have to research

502
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,720
what pests and diseases those are going

503
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:17,889
to get and you have to treat those for

504
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,529
the pests and the diseases now yeah

505
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,050
that's frustrating too especially since

506
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,730
you know I mean because most of the

507
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:27,069
folks who are going to be running an

508
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,930
indoor polyculture environment they are

509
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:30,789
probably also the mindset that they are

510
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,640
going to be using beneficial insects and

511
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:36,759
so that's that that's great on its face

512
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,340
but listening to you describe all of the

513
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,579
different variables that help us when we

514
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:45,250
are growing outdoors reproducing those

515
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:48,129
indoors becomes less and less likely

516
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,309
based on you know time resources and

517
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:55,390
just the difficulty in trying to for

518
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:57,129
example you know bring in the variety of

519
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,860
beneficial insects that we're able to

520
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,950
get outside so let me so so clearly

521
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:04,839
you're not a big fan of of you know

522
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,180
cover cropping or probably more

523
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,799
accurately green mulching indoors but

524
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,640
let's turn that on its head for a second

525
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,220
if somebody were to going to polyculture

526
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,310
indoor

527
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,559
even if it's a thin sliced window what

528
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:22,349
do you think would be the best way for

529
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,690
them to go about it like is there a you

530
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:26,909
know if 95% of people who are going to

531
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,279
do it are going to do it wrong is there

532
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:32,400
a 5% best practice that you would

533
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:35,700
recommend for people who are dead set on

534
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,040
doing polyculture indoors and what would

535
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,930
be your best advice for them well first

536
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:43,500
of all you know and this is the thing

537
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:45,390
that you know I've banged my head on the

538
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,700
wall kind of thing because again I get

539
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:51,540
contacted by numerous growers every

540
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,269
single day and a lot of the polyculture

541
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:59,220
living soil people freak out when they

542
00:22:54,269 --> 00:23:02,009
find bugs and and the thing is is if

543
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,440
you're trying to recreate indoor ecology

544
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:08,089
you you're going to have bugs in there

545
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:12,570
and remember you know less than 1% of

546
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:14,189
insects are really a problem of economic

547
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:15,839
you know what we consider economic

548
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,059
importance where they're going to damage

549
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,789
the plants but people want to do this

550
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:24,389
stuff inside but want to see no insects

551
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:26,369
at all but a lot of the insects that I

552
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,770
am getting images of are just absolutely

553
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:32,159
benign things that you know to try

554
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:36,869
Devore's or you know may be specific to

555
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:39,120
feeding on the cover crop but if you

556
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:43,619
wanted to do it the first thing I would

557
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:47,129
do is I would pick your plant I would

558
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:49,500
research that plant and look is is it a

559
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,050
host for spider mites is it a hose for

560
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,029
cotton melon a food is it a host for

561
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:56,759
onion thrips and I would look to make

562
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:58,109
sure that none not not can it just feed

563
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:59,369
on it occasionally but is it a major

564
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:02,179
problems I mean I'm going to pick the

565
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:04,679
worst possible cover crop ever soybeans

566
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,430
the soybeans are beans the you know

567
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,049
we're talking about four and they're

568
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,029
great for breed being spider mites right

569
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:12,389
their soybeans would be off your list

570
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:14,579
I'm also pretty anti marigold because

571
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,790
when we were marigold and greenhouses

572
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:19,619
they get every pest problem known to man

573
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,539
and they get spider mites they get

574
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:24,569
thrips issues they have a lot of disease

575
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:27,058
issues people like to hold marigolds in

576
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:29,609
this you know holy

577
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:32,579
vessel of this is amazing plan this is

578
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:34,918
true you're so right but the problem is

579
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,619
people don't understand genetics they

580
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,870
don't understand breeding a lot of you

581
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:41,398
know old stuff that refers to marigolds

582
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:43,729
are actually pop marigolds which are

583
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:46,079
calendula which are not today's

584
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,028
marigolds and today's marigolds and this

585
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,869
is a whole nother rabbit-hole discussion

586
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:55,859
these plants that you get today and this

587
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:59,158
seed you get today have been bred for

588
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,538
human characteristic what do we want we

589
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,369
want them this height we want them this

590
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:06,509
color we want the big showy petals

591
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:09,959
they've not been bred for feeding

592
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:12,480
beneficials for feeding pollinators and

593
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,610
things like that and we bred a lot of

594
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,558
the characteristics out of these plants

595
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:20,219
that insects needs you look at a miracle

596
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,808
and how tightly pedaled it is how is a

597
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,788
beneficial supposed to get down in there

598
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:26,038
to get pollen and nectar if you look at

599
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,329
some of the older simpler marigolds that

600
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:29,009
are more single pedaled

601
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:31,288
you know it's you have easier access

602
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:33,298
there same thing when you look at roses

603
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:35,669
the older Rose varieties that open up

604
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,349
the bees and beneficials can get in

605
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:40,649
there to the palm end nectar these new

606
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:42,538
really tight balled fancy roses they

607
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:44,849
can't have access to it and in some

608
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:47,190
plant species they've actually bred to

609
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:51,089
the point they're basically no pollen or

610
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,649
it's useless pollen in the plant so you

611
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:54,089
have to be really careful about looking

612
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:55,618
these plants understand just saying

613
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:58,918
marigold marigolds like saying almost

614
00:25:55,618 --> 00:26:01,558
automobile there's it's a generic term

615
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,840
it can encompass multiple you know again

616
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:06,118
it could be calendula it could be

617
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,359
different things so it's too broad of a

618
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:12,209
term so you know I know a lot of people

619
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,189
look at clover and then of course I get

620
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,470
the messages they're freaking out they

621
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:20,249
got thrips clover mites

622
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:23,730
oh cool reminds yes and they're very

623
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:25,379
visible and but again thrips the

624
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,329
secondary way now the question is is

625
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:30,569
what thrips do they have on the clover

626
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:32,519
and will it feed on cannabis and this is

627
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:35,788
where it gets into identification and

628
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:38,490
you can't just use a hand lens normally

629
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:41,039
to identify thrip species to tell the

630
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,859
difference between like western flower

631
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,480
onion pretty much have to have super

632
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:47,399
high magnification or put them under

633
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,799
microscope which is high magnification

634
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,830
you know a few of them like you know

635
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:55,559
kind of thrips that's easier to identify

636
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:59,129
but that's super high magnification but

637
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,710
you know you can't just stand there and

638
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,000
say this is that without again you got

639
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,250
to get in there and look at their little

640
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,819
hairs basically on their bodies to tell

641
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,839
them apart

642
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:11,700
and this is why it's complicated and

643
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:12,980
what frustrates me when I go to a lot of

644
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,299
these meetings is people just

645
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,710
oversimplify it they're like oh just

646
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,349
apply this cover crop and you'll never

647
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,259
have any past issues if it worked that

648
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:25,319
way why do I have all these growers

649
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:26,879
contacting me every single day so I'm

650
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,379
going to go write down that I'm going to

651
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,320
I'm going to put salt in that wound

652
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,390
Suzanne so so certainly people who are

653
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,279
commercial growers who are listening you

654
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:38,220
know and they've got a dedicated IPM

655
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,539
person and they are you know hopefully

656
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,490
have got the time to do the kind of

657
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:44,190
research that we've been calling for so

658
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,349
far so that a a proper program can be

659
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,690
developed for their bio region and

660
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:50,039
particularly their types of you know

661
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,769
environment and plants whether

662
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:54,180
indoor/outdoor a greenhouse but the vast

663
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:56,910
majority of people who are listening

664
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,529
today are not commercial growers you

665
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,710
know they've got somewhere between you

666
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:04,200
know 4 and 40 plants in their yard and

667
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:07,289
they don't necessarily have the time and

668
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,980
access to resources to do an entire

669
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:13,529
program with the touring that you have

670
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,509
done so far and and I don't know I know

671
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:18,210
that I'm talking about an entire country

672
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:22,379
but bear with me have you come across

673
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:26,039
any plans that you think are you know

674
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:29,130
pretty good surefire plants to plant

675
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,909
alongside your cannabis that are going

676
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:35,850
to provide either some banker or trap

677
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,440
benefits so that people who the same is

678
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:39,089
the same people who are just like oh I

679
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,559
heard that Mary roads are good around my

680
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:42,059
cannabis plants so they so they grew

681
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,460
marigolds right and we now know that's

682
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,289
not appropriate but but even though we

683
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,630
know that done properly this is a bigger

684
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:51,509
question before we go to commercial is

685
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:53,370
there are there any like varieties that

686
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:54,190
you think are generally going to help

687
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:56,109
and if you're good

688
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,940
to plant anything without doing your

689
00:28:56,109 --> 00:29:01,058
proper homework you should go with these

690
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:03,820
well you know you should ask me what I

691
00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:05,349
do in my yard because you know even

692
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:09,220
though I don't grow cannabis here you

693
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:11,918
know I grow tomatoes and I ring all my

694
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,679
tomato plants with alyssum all of them

695
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,629
because we know and there's been good

696
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,570
research looking at this alyssum is a

697
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:22,449
really good pollen nectar source for

698
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:24,278
aureus the minut Peyer bug which loves

699
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,500
thrips which will feed on spider mites

700
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:30,730
and loves cannabis plants whenever I

701
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:34,419
scout cannabis outdoors whether it be

702
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:37,230
New York State or California or Oregon

703
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:39,580
Washington I always find aureus in

704
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:43,740
cannabis so we know it loves that crop

705
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:46,298
and again it needs pollen and nectar and

706
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:50,079
your cannabis isn't going to have pollen

707
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:53,168
and nectar Tomatoes early on don't have

708
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:55,178
pollen and nectar but I put the alyssum

709
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:57,669
around them and then that will feed them

710
00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:01,298
and commercial growers actually grow

711
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:03,490
pots of alyssum early in the season and

712
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:05,648
then they sprinkle aureus on there and

713
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:09,009
they build the aureus population up on

714
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:11,500
them so that when the thrips come in the

715
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:15,490
spring they have a whole army of aureus

716
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,960
there for you I will tell you aureus

717
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:23,759
though needs at least twelve hours of

718
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:26,048
sunlight or it will you know go into

719
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,480
whether they call diapause which is

720
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:31,210
basically you know insect hibernation

721
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,679
and you know in the southern regions we

722
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,048
don't worry about that too much but up

723
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,360
north and greenhouses when we start the

724
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:38,319
alyssum early we just put them under you

725
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,250
know if you don't have artificial

726
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,450
lighting we just put them under

727
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,089
artificial lighting to make sure they

728
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,850
get 12 hours of light first but for the

729
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:49,329
homeowner the smaller grow you know you

730
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:52,769
can buy a lissome from seed and you can

731
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:56,439
just start it I would not recommend

732
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:58,349
buying finished plants in because you do

733
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,190
not know what they've been treated with

734
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:01,689
you don't know if they've been treated

735
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,509
with an insecticide you don't know if

736
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,519
they've been treated with a PG R or

737
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:07,929
anything so it's better off to grow them

738
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,109
yourself

739
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:12,519
us to make sure but I think alyssum is

740
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:14,408
one that we have a really good track

741
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:18,278
record in ornamentals and vegetable with

742
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:20,320
with that we're seeing it's slowly being

743
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,589
adopted into cannabis and it's got a

744
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:27,819
good track record of being a good banker

745
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:31,058
plant as well as a nectar and pollen

746
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:32,558
resource plant fabulous so we're gonna

747
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:34,240
go ahead and take our first short break

748
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,769
and be right back you are listening to

749
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,259
shaping fire and my guest today is

750
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:41,499
entomologist Suzanne Wainwright evans

751
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:42,788
the bug lady for years organic

752
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:45,069
cultivators have been looking for a

753
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:46,778
replacement for using peat moss peat

754
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,398
moss has long been the go-to soil

755
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:50,440
amendment for water retention in

756
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,268
container growing but organic growers

757
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,548
know that peat moss is an unsustainable

758
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:56,888
resource and the mining of peat bogs

759
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:59,378
destroys habitat and releases sequester

760
00:31:56,888 --> 00:32:01,569
carbon but peat must work so well that

761
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:03,038
many have continued to use it but now

762
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:04,898
there's finally a revolutionary

763
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,700
replacement for peat moss that shares

764
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:09,729
the same benefits while also being

765
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,980
sustainable pittmoss sounds and acts

766
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,079
like peat moss but instead of being

767
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,118
mined from fragile ecosystems it

768
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,398
actually is made from up cycled organic

769
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:19,928
paper and tree bark pit Moss is

770
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,729
excellent at retaining water in your

771
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,940
substrate and creating air pockets and

772
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:26,889
tiny living environments for microbes

773
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,899
pittmoss instantly increases aeration

774
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:31,569
nutrient absorption and water

775
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:33,489
conservation to carefully and locally

776
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:35,558
sourced pit Moss is the result of

777
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:38,769
decades long research into the use of

778
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:40,990
recycled paper fibers pit Moss has the

779
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:44,048
fluffy nature of peat moss and handles

780
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:46,679
exactly the same and like peat moss pit

781
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:48,849
Moss is inert so it won't change your ph

782
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,009
available in a range of preparations

783
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:53,980
including a nutrient enhanced blend a

784
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:56,128
coco quar blend and also as an organic

785
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,960
soil conditioner with no added nutrients

786
00:32:56,128 --> 00:33:02,259
pittmoss is also available as an animal

787
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:07,950
bedding so go to pittmoss calm now to

790
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:17,049
plants pittmoss for many transitioning

791
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,879
to organic gardening can be overwhelming

792
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:22,000
there's so much to learn about soil

793
00:33:18,878 --> 00:33:23,709
biology and fermentation bio flux

794
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,079
mented plant booze from ever flux

795
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,750
simplifies organic farming so you can

796
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,639
start growing organically today invented

797
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,279
by a California farmer growing organic

798
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,290
for 40 years bio flux is a fermented

799
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,450
natural farming preparation for those

800
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:39,430
who want a natural micro booster without

801
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,740
having to brew their own this

802
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,720
extraordinary chemical free growth and

803
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,880
terpene enhancer improves root

804
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,370
development accelerates the conversion

805
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,340
of organic matter into humus increases

806
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:52,929
nutrient use efficiency and up jake and

807
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:55,480
increases beneficial microbes activity

808
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:57,910
in addition to the bio flux fermented

809
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,549
plant booster ever flux also makes an

810
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,529
activated biochar called taro flux that

811
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:05,230
is infused with the bio flux plant

812
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:07,240
booster imagine combining the buffering

813
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,280
and rhizosphere enhancing qualities of

814
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,128
biochar infused with a range of

815
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,990
earthworm castings insect frass kelp and

816
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:16,719
crab meal moister shell and other

817
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:18,789
ingredients I'm using Tara flux infused

818
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,239
biochar the summer myself and it smells

819
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:23,860
alive rich and potent these products

820
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,658
have been scientifically proven to match

821
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,309
yields and increase flower quality and

822
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:30,369
pest resistance when compared to

823
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:32,590
traditional NPK inputs if you are

824
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,329
looking for reliable organic fertilizers

825
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,610
that will free you up to focus on other

826
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:38,500
aspects of your garden consider using

00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,480
the range of all-natural regenerative

831
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:52,210
their instagram at ever flux while I

832
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:54,099
love growing under the Sun there's a lot

833
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,690
of good reasons to grow indoors and if

834
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:57,429
you're like most folks you want a

835
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,470
lighting source that grows high yielding

836
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:02,109
healthy plants without using excessive

837
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:04,119
amounts of electricity BIOS lighting

838
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,039
creates biological lighting solutions

839
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,949
that brings the natural brilliance of

840
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:10,809
the outdoors into your grow room BIOS

841
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:12,849
lighting has the attributes that I look

842
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:14,889
for in a horticultural lighting solution

843
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:16,480
I've bought those cheap lights online

844
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:20,469
and they're difficult to work with and

845
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,510
fail in no time in contrast my BIOS LED

846
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:26,139
light is industrial grade to last a long

847
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:28,480
time it is ip66 wet rated so little full

848
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:30,460
your overspray won't harm it it is easy

849
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,440
to clean without taking it down and of

850
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,659
course the most important aspect it is

851
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,470
built for the exact light spectrum I

852
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:37,598
want four

853
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:39,189
great yielding healthy cannabis plants

854
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,490
and it doesn't hurt that their lighting

855
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:44,260
rigs look badass too many horticultural

856
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:45,848
LED lighting systems are based on

857
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,740
irrelevant performance metrics and

858
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:50,470
people love to argue online about these

859
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:52,569
numbers I prefer to judge on par photon

860
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:54,608
efficiency and how happy my plants are

861
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,340
and the BIOS lights exceed my

862
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:59,739
expectations in these categories BIOS

863
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,019
lights have an optimized broad spectrum

864
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:04,389
that maximizes photosynthesis and plant

865
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:06,789
growth while also providing the ideal

866
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:09,219
conditions for superior part efficacy

867
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:11,170
and a comfortable visual experience I

868
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:13,929
also love their attentive and over

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,090
involved they have studied how light

873
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:24,789
impacts cannabis plants and devised an

874
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,980
overall strategy that works I encourage

875
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:29,440

your host Shengo Louis and our guest

885
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:51,670
this week is entomologist Suzanne

886
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,108
Wainwright Evans the bug lady so Suzanne

887
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,780
you know we were talking in the last set

888
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:58,449
about how you know folks want to be poly

889
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:01,140
culture and organic and regenerative and

890
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:03,519
when they try to do that indoors

891
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:06,400
often they've got a headspace that they

892
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,929
also want sterility right and one of the

893
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,820
things that we know from trying to do

894
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:12,819
regenerative agriculture outdoors is

895
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:16,539
that civility is not really our goal

896
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:19,930
outdoors because we are trying to create

897
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:21,820
an entire ecosystem back and forth with

898
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:23,980
the ecosystem around us you know we're

899
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,500
trying to blend with the ecosystem and

900
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,079
not stay separate so that the natural

901
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,059
benefits of the outdoor environment can

902
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,329
be supportive of our cannabis garden as

903
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:36,880
well well indoors of course we are not

904
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:40,150
getting the benefits of being you know

905
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:44,019
couched in a regular organic environment

906
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:46,030
and so indoor folks they try to walk

907
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:48,449
this line between we need to keep the

908
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,730
grow clean and

909
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:53,338
and air quotes sterile so that we don't

910
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:56,789
run into any disease or pest pressure

911
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:58,710
but at the same time you know doing that

912
00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:01,469
is not going to be very effective for

913
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:03,539
trying to replicate an ecosystem what

914
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:06,509
kind of advice do you give folks who are

915
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:08,460
trying to walk that line well I think

916
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:12,359
it's a very difficult line to walk and

917
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:16,108
again there's this mindset of you can

918
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:18,719
reproduce outdoors indoors I just I

919
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:22,819
don't think it's completely possible you

920
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:25,139
you can be sustainable but you also then

921
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,720
understand that you are running at

922
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:30,659
higher risk of pests and disease by

923
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:33,899
doing that I know that's not what you

924
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:35,549
want to hear but that's especially over

925
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,750
the last few years working with more

926
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:44,160
regenitive growers is is what I see over

927
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:46,530
and over again if you're gonna not

928
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,670
change out your soil for example and

929
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:52,710
you're pumping in you know all these

930
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,608
fungi and bacteria and topdressing with

931
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,190
compost

932
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:58,588
you know mites and insects are going to

933
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:00,000
find their way in because decomposers

934
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:01,739
are going to want to live in that soil

935
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,179
and you're going to have a lot of that

936
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,669
kind of stuff living in the soil and

937
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:07,409
just again today I was contacted by

938
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,329
somebody else said oh my gosh there's

939
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:11,848
all these mites in my soil how do I kill

940
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:15,030
them well they're most likely just

941
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:19,170
either to try divorce or they're feeding

942
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:20,940
on fungus or some kind of soil decompose

943
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,800
or kind of thing and they're not hurting

944
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,599
anything but they can get to such high

945
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
numbers that you literally can scrape

946
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,838
them off the edge of the beds with

947
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,810
credit cards because they get so heavy

948
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,949
and people don't want to see that but if

949
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:33,719
you're going to grow in these kinds of

950
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:35,429
systems that's the kind of stuff you're

951
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,618
going to have to deal with and that's

952
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:39,989
just that the trade-off and you're going

953
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,818
to have to expect to see you're going to

954
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:43,919
have a lot more springtails

955
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:46,559
you're going to have a lot more again of

956
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,530
these decomposing kind of insects and

957
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,940
mites and those systems the question I

958
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,210
get all the time is do they damage the

959
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:56,068
plants and honestly we don't know and

960
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:58,619
you know things like springtails which

961
00:39:56,068 --> 00:40:00,358
are kalimba 'la you know we honestly

962
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,760
they haven't been studied as extensively

963
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,679
and the

964
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,940
our numerous species of kalimba so

965
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,889
someone just contact me and say they

966
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,059
have springtails you know super-high

967
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:10,400
numbers are they going to cause damage

968
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:12,019
to my crop honestly I don't know because

969
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,670
we don't know what species it is and

970
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:15,559
does that species actually cause damage

971
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,289
because in Europe they do have problems

972
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:21,289
in like in theory and production with

973
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:23,960
springtails damaging the roots on an

974
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:27,289
theory improper busy trying to kill them

975
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,809
where oftentimes over here and the US

976
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:31,219
it's seen as a sign of soil health again

977
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:33,380
I think this comes down to different

978
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:35,869
species and the different environments

979
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,820
and what's going on so you can't just

980
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:40,969
make a broad blanket statement that

981
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:43,280
they're good or bad but the reality is

982
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:45,049
is if you have a high organic matter

983
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,490
soil you're going to end up with a lot

984
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,500
of them and you're just going to have to

985
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:51,139
learn to live with them and it brings us

986
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,449
back to you know the you know your your

987
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:55,909
gospel which is identification is

988
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:58,399
everything and it's interesting you know

989
00:40:55,909 --> 00:41:02,809
I tore quite a few regenerative cannabis

990
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:05,690
gardens and how few of them I also see

991
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:08,150
people having a microscope nearby and

992
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,670
what I continually tell people is you

993
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:14,289
know it's one thing when you are going

994
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:18,019
to do kind of like a a non regenerative

995
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:20,000
synthetic grow when your best practice

996
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:21,829
is kind of like kill everything right

997
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,380
and and you're just kind of like carpet

998
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:26,809
bombing your grow with with the things

999
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,329
but but but in a regenerative grow when

1000
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:33,139
you're like okay we only really want to

1001
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:36,469
get rid of the 1% of the pests that may

1002
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:38,690
actually be a threat the only way you're

1003
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:43,069
going to do that is if you get educated

1004
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:44,929
on identifying these these pests and and

1005
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:46,340
and have a microscope which honestly you

1006
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:50,719
should probably have to be making sure

1007
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:54,559
that your compost is active anyway and I

1008
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,329
can imagine that you are busy giving you

1009
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,159
know lessons to people when you tour

1010
00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:00,699
there grows that says you know you need

1011
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:03,379
a bench over here with a microscope

1012
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:05,210
well I generally I find that most

1013
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,099
growers don't know how to use

1014
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,170
microscopes and if they have microscopes

1015
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:11,089
they don't take care of them which is

1016
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,519
painful to me they don't keep the covers

1017
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,600
on them because speaking from someone

1018
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,619
that had to have their microscope

1019
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,119
recently one

1020
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,609
microscopes recently serviced future

1021
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,949
microscopes cleaned it's $300 put a

1022
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:25,099
cover on it to keep the dust out of it

1023
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:27,109
because yes there's dust in grows but

1024
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:30,949
that's why I really push people the Dino

1025
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:33,620
lights because it's it's it's sealed you

1026
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:35,059
don't have to worry about you know stuff

1027
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:37,429
getting in there they're easy to use you

1028
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:39,559
can take pictures because when you say

1029
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:42,230
microscope microscopes are meant to be

1030
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:44,960
used with slides and a lot of the

1031
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:48,289
insects growers aren't going to slide

1032
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,269
mount insects it is a pain in the

1033
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:52,639
backside to do you got to put the

1034
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:55,280
special glue mount down I use like a

1035
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,230
little one hair bristle brush to get

1036
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,370
their legs in position and get the slide

1037
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:04,340
cover on that's not going to happen

1038
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:06,349
dissecting scopes are more I think would

1039
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,570
be appropriate but remember a microscope

1040
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:10,069
or a dissecting scope don't necessarily

1041
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,230
come with the camera so now you got to

1042
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,670
buy a camera and that's why a dino light

1043
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,590
is so easy because it's essentially a

1044
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,170
dissecting scope with a built-in camera

1045
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:21,019
and that way you can easily take

1046
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:23,420
pictures and send them because learning

1047
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:27,739
to use a microscope is a whole thing in

1048
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:29,659
itself and I when I saw you when I saw

1049
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:32,659
you present with the Dyna scope at

1050
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:35,210
regenerative conference in Humboldt

1051
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:37,489
I was really blown away by it but I was

1052
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:40,280
I had the impression that it did not

1053
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:41,750
have the sensitivity for everything that

1054
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,580
I might need in the garden and I was

1055
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,989
thinking oh might as well not get it

1056
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,619
because I'm still going to need a

1057
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:50,509
microscope at some point anyway and and

1058
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:52,069
what I'm hearing you say now is actually

1059
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,690
making me think well if I don't actually

1060
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:58,070
need the microscope if actually what I

1061
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:59,570
need is a dissection scope that the tool

1062
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:03,080
that you showed us the Dyna scope

1063
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,610
actually may be the one tool for for all

1064
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:07,429
the gardeners needs is that your

1065
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,289
experience well I don't say all the

1066
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:11,029
needs because I not forgot not prying

1067
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:13,400
out for looking at compost tea compost

1068
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:16,519
you need a microscope when it comes

1069
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,889
unpacked for insect stuff you know the

1070
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:22,909
first thing I bought 20 years ago

1071
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:25,460
well first big fancy thing I bought for

1072
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:27,529
was a dissecting scope not a microscope

1073
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,210
a dissecting scope you can put a leaf

1074
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,310
under you can cut a branch on

1075
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,530
because you can put you know things with

1076
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:35,420
height on them a microscope you can only

1077
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,830
put things with slides so you have bugs

1078
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,420
on the leaf

1079
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:40,519
you don't put a leaf under a microscope

1080
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,349
you got to lift the bug off you got to

1081
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,750
put it on a slide you got to put a slide

1082
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,809
cover on and do all that a dissecting

1083
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:50,030
scope you can just slap it under and

1084
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:53,769
look at it and away you go

1085
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:56,920
a Dynalite basically functions as a

1086
00:44:53,769 --> 00:45:03,500
dissecting scope with a built-in camera

1087
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:06,079
now you can buy cameras for your

1088
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,610
microscope or your dissecting scope but

1089
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,159
when you buy your microscope or Dyna

1090
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:13,039
scope you have to I mean microscope or

1091
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:16,969
dice a dissecting scope you have to make

1092
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,980
sure it's a tri ocular camera ocular

1093
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:21,649
system so you have one for each eye and

1094
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:24,559
then you have a third hole that you can

1095
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:26,599
mount a camera on because it is I mean

1096
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,309
the pictures people send me in this you

1097
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,949
know this is where my grapes - you know

1098
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:34,009
if you want free ID at least meet me

1099
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:36,710
halfway and send me decent pictures you

1100
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:39,770
know stop putting your camera up to the

1101
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:41,869
eye hole on your microscope and trying

1102
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:44,500
to get an image that's blurred around

1103
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:46,759
the edge and all that I mean you know

1104
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,559
you can get a Dynalite the entry-level

1105
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,020
one is like a hundred bucks I think the

1106
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,509
one that's $325 is a better place to be

1107
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:55,730
but you can even get a decent dissecting

1108
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:57,860
scope for like 300 dollars these days

1109
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:00,650
and we're not talking you know yes you

1110
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,400
can go spend as much as you want you

1111
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,110
know I

1112
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,780
you can spend ten thousand dollars on a

1113
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:09,769
microscope but for most cannabis people

1114
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:11,390
the the ones from celestron makes a

1115
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,880
really nice dissecting scope and I

1116
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:16,969
really love the celestron microscope I

1117
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,680
love that microscope if if you're

1118
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:21,559
somebody that's going to spend ten hours

1119
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:24,230
a day at a microscope counting you know

1120
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:26,119
cells or things like that yes you need

1121
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,860
the $10,000 microscope because it will

1122
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,449
really reduce the eye strain if you're

1123
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,890
just slapping something they're looking

1124
00:46:29,449 --> 00:46:34,219
for five minutes and then you're done

1125
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:36,980
you can use these three $400 microscopes

1126
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:39,439
and they work perfectly fine and the one

1127
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:43,068
from celestron that microscope I've had

1128
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,170
it now a year and I absolutely love it

1129
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:47,268
I have nothing negative to say and it's

1130
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:49,548
a triaxial one and you can mount a

1131
00:46:47,268 --> 00:46:51,348
camera right on it one of the things

1132
00:46:49,548 --> 00:46:53,989
that's great about the Dyna scope too is

1133
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:56,420
that it's so compact that it's really

1134
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:58,579
easy to safely pack in your gear and

1135
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,199
take with you either out into the field

1136
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:02,359
or you know if you're if you're doing

1137
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:04,039
the rounds over multiple commercial

1138
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:07,098
grows it's just you know most of us

1139
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:09,140
think about us a microscope or a

1140
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:12,048
dissection scope it's very it tends to

1141
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:13,969
be more you set it up and it stays and

1142
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:16,940
it lives in this one place but the Dyna

1143
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:19,009
scope is really you know it's it's

1144
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,719
highly mobile so for so for folks who

1145
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:23,778
are going to forget the name Dino scope

1146
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:27,048
I'll go ahead excuse me Dino light like

1147
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:29,778
I just did I'll go ahead and put a link

1148
00:47:27,048 --> 00:47:32,538
on the page for the podcast episode at

1149
00:47:29,778 --> 00:47:34,699
shaping fire com so going back to the

1150
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:37,339
banker plants in the trap plant Suzanne

1151
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:40,009
you know a lot of people have a

1152
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:44,179
difference of opinion of actually where

1153
00:47:40,009 --> 00:47:45,978
you plant them with container gardening

1154
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:48,858
some folks believe that you should be

1155
00:47:45,978 --> 00:47:52,028
planting them below the cannabis plant

1156
00:47:48,858 --> 00:47:55,278
in the same pot so that they're close

1157
00:47:52,028 --> 00:47:56,809
whereas you know from what I'm gathering

1158
00:47:55,278 --> 00:47:58,940
from what you've been saying so far and

1159
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:03,140
how I like to do it is you actually put

1160
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:05,809
the plant in its own pot along the edges

1161
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:08,239
of the growing area what do you find is

1162
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:10,699
the best practice I think having them in

1163
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:12,739
their own pots because if they get a

1164
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:14,298
pest problem and they're in a pot you

1165
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:17,659
just pick the pot up and chuck it out

1166
00:48:14,298 --> 00:48:20,659
the door and it's gone and with the

1167
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:22,818
aphid banker plant systems we replace

1168
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:26,298
those like every two weeks so it's a

1169
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:30,048
constant revolving door and lissome if

1170
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:31,429
it gets too hot it can stop blooming and

1171
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:33,679
now you've got all this you know just

1172
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:34,879
greenery in your pot absolutely do them

1173
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,948
in separate pots they have different

1174
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,670
watering requirements they're not the

1175
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:39,680
same plant

1176
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:41,719
I would not plant them right in the pots

1177
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:46,669
I would have them in pots you can remove

1178
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:48,949
the other thing is let's say okay let's

1179
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:50,989
just pretend you know everything's going

1180
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:53,719
great you've got great aureus going in

1181
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:55,458
there with your alyssum but oh my gosh

1182
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,539
now we've got him for us it might well

1183
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:59,629
you're going to have to

1184
00:48:56,539 --> 00:49:01,939
Spray because I've said this before and

1185
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:04,400
I know a lot of people hate me but you

1186
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:06,139
know I do not think that any of the

1187
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,329
biocontrol agents are really controlling

1188
00:49:06,139 --> 00:49:09,798
him for us it might all our successes

1189
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:12,469
have been coming in and spraying with a

1190
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:13,969
good solid horticultural oil now if

1191
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:15,380
you've got those banker plants and

1192
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:16,668
they're planted in your pots and you

1193
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,528
come in and spray they're going to get

1194
00:49:16,668 --> 00:49:21,199
oil in the banker plants and possibly

1195
00:49:18,528 --> 00:49:22,429
could either damage the plant because I

1196
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:26,989
don't think alyssum really wants a

1197
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:28,759
coating of oil and also it could kill

1198
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:29,778
some of the insects and you know if

1199
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:31,458
you're going to spray you know something

1200
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:34,130
like Bavaria or I cereal you know

1201
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:35,568
whatever you're going to spray so the

1202
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:37,009
banker plants what we do this is what we

1203
00:49:35,568 --> 00:49:38,478
do in ornamental systems as we go

1204
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:41,028
through we just gather up all the banker

1205
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:42,558
plants we take them away we do our spray

1206
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:46,458
we wait a few days and then we bring the

1207
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,989
banker plants right back in yeah so that

1208
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:49,608
way you want to keep them in their own

1209
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:50,989
pot so they're mobile you can remove

1210
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:52,909
them and you can bring them back and you

1211
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:54,438
can swap them out when you want and and

1212
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:56,418
honestly that you know if you're going

1213
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:58,938
to be properly taking care of these

1214
00:49:56,418 --> 00:50:00,469
plants they're they're you know the food

1215
00:49:58,938 --> 00:50:02,358
that they're rhizosphere wants or

1216
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:03,469
whatever the soil requirements are

1217
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:04,818
likely going to be different than what

1218
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:08,059
you want to be doing for your cannabis

1219
00:50:04,818 --> 00:50:10,639
anyway yes and you know I had one grower

1220
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:12,229
that he does the diet important again

1221
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,568
this is ornamentals but again you know

1222
00:50:12,228 --> 00:50:16,098
I've had a bajillion years of experience

1223
00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:17,778
in ornamentals than what I've been doing

1224
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:20,989
is how can we take that knowledge and

1225
00:50:17,778 --> 00:50:23,358
apply it to cannabis but this one

1226
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:25,938
ornamental grower he keeps lined along

1227
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:28,518
the wall of his greenhouse Mullin plants

1228
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:31,668
with another beneficial insect called

1229
00:50:28,518 --> 00:50:33,738
duyst's IFAs it likes thrips white flies

1230
00:50:31,668 --> 00:50:36,949
and also snack on spider mites and then

1231
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:38,659
when he has a pest issue then he picks

1232
00:50:36,949 --> 00:50:40,159
up a couple pots of the Mullen plants

1233
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:42,048
and he goes and sets them and he just

1234
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,509
sisters them next to where the pest

1235
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:46,188
problem is and leaves him there so that

1236
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:48,048
the the die safe is then move into the

1237
00:50:46,188 --> 00:50:50,088
crop clean up the problem then

1238
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,768
eventually he moves the Mullen plants

1239
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:54,739
back together into their lineup along

1240
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:56,238
the wall where the die psifas can just

1241
00:50:54,739 --> 00:50:58,759
sit there and continually breed on the

1242
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,619
mullen so he uses them as like a hot

1243
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:03,650
spot treatment so again another reason

1244
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:05,059
why to have them in pots yeah that's a

1245
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:08,389
really great best practice that's an

1246
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:09,460
awesome idea so when choosing them I

1247
00:51:08,389 --> 00:51:12,039
mean certainly

1248
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:14,588
it sounds like the the majority of the

1249
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:17,889
time we are going to choose our plants

1250
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:23,400
based on the specificity of what our

1251
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:23,400
pest is and what our alternative

1252
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:29,679
snacking pest will be for our beneficial

1253
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:32,950
insect and and really that will kind of

1254
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:37,059
reverse engineer which plant we want to

1255
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:40,239
go with to sister with with the cannabis

1256
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:42,849
plants there is a secondary awareness

1257
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:45,608
that folks have about annuals and

1258
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,960
perennials because some of these plants

1259
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:49,838
that people have a tendency to use

1260
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,519
they've got shorter life cycles and and

1261
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:52,869
they really just want to plan it and

1262
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:56,380
forget it right which is part of the

1263
00:51:52,869 --> 00:51:58,570
problem but how do you explain to people

1264
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:01,780
or get them thinking in the right way

1265
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:05,349
about you know matching the lifecycle

1266
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:07,810
with of the plant the the the banker or

1267
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:09,820
trap plant with the lifecycle of the

1268
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:11,320
cannabis and my suspicion is you're just

1269
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,880
going to say grow a whole ton of them in

1270
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,050
their own pots and swap them in and out

1271
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,000
yes

1272
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:18,730
yeah they just answered your own

1273
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,989
question right on as I was asking and

1274
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,269
I'm like I think she's already taught

1275
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:24,459
this today that's essentially right and

1276
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:26,530
you know what and this is not to say

1277
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:29,380
down the road somebody may find the

1278
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:32,109
magic bean that you know you can plan

1279
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:35,230
under cannabis and it thrives and you

1280
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:38,019
know it has no pest issues and but as of

1281
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:40,260
yet we've not found anything like that

1282
00:52:38,019 --> 00:52:44,500
and I think having them in separate pots

1283
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:46,200
and try to look for you know again where

1284
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:52,059
there has been a little research done

1285
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:54,399
and not just anecdotal stuff because you

1286
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:56,170
know I mean I know anecdotal is often

1287
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,190
times where research starts but I'm just

1288
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,358
seeing a lot of people getting

1289
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,460
themselves into trouble because remember

1290
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:02,319
people generally don't call me when

1291
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,300
everything's hunky-dory people contact

1292
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,730
me when there's a problem so I get to

1293
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:09,940
hear about what everybody's done to get

1294
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:14,588
to that point and I definitely see a

1295
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:18,059
pattern of you know cover crops and you

1296
00:53:14,588 --> 00:53:21,159
know same soil with multiple multiple

1297
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:22,210
Harvin's planted in it and pest numbers

1298
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:23,379
are just going to build in those

1299
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:25,449
situations

1300
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,660
yeah there really is a fine area between

1301
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:29,859
you know citizen science and bro science

1302
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:31,420
you know one of them you're actually

1303
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,070
testing things and the other one you're

1304
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,220
probably not it's just how you learned

1305
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:38,170
it from your friend or your mentor and

1306
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:41,109
and you know we cannabis people we've

1307
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:43,990
been on our own for a long time and we

1308
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:46,000
haven't had access necessarily to legit

1309
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:48,250
entomologists so I think it's going to

1310
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,110
take a little more time for not only

1311
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:53,170
their research to come about and to

1312
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:57,160
actually be done but also for you know

1313
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:59,320
cannabis cultivators to realize that you

1314
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:02,049
know there there is useful information

1315
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,400
available outside of cannabis culture so

1316
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,840
I think you're going to hate this next

1317
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,660
question sue Zampa let's go for it

1318
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,420
anyway because you know you are you you

1319
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:12,969
know you are very clear that you know

1320
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:15,880
you have to be aware of your bio region

1321
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:17,559
right and that you know when you answer

1322
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,750
a question it's going to be a different

1323
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:21,670
answer for California versus Florida

1324
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:25,329
versus Maine and that all makes sense

1325
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:27,519
however with the cultivators in the

1326
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:31,029
different parts of the country each

1327
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:34,840
having their own sorts of pests that

1328
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:37,780
they need to deal with how do you

1329
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:41,470
recommend like a mental methodology how

1330
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:45,910
do you suggest thinking through what

1331
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:49,750
trap plant or what pests the cultivator

1332
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:51,099
is going to want to think they which one

1333
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,079
so they want to prepare for is what I'm

1334
00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:54,699
trying to say like you you want to

1335
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:57,400
prepare for the pests that you don't

1336
00:54:54,699 --> 00:55:00,849
have yet but but there is a wide range

1337
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,230
of pests that that could be a problem

1338
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:05,710
with cannabis plants

1339
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:08,650
so what hints do you give to cultivators

1340
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,929
to kind of be precedent prescient and

1341
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:12,789
look into the future of what pests you

1342
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:14,139
want to prepare for because these are

1343
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:18,400
the ones that you're most likely to get

1344
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:22,420
where you live well one of the things is

1345
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:25,990
that for the indoor grows we're seeing a

1346
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:28,720
lot of the same stuff because they're a

1347
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:32,289
bit excluded from you know the outdoor

1348
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:35,169
ecology is when we have you know outdoor

1349
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:36,559
production or greenhouses where the

1350
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:39,110
sides roll up or

1351
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:42,650
hi Tunnel situation where we do have

1352
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:45,079
regional stuff but I you know the one

1353
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:48,530
thing that has been very interesting to

1354
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:51,019
watch is basically how the cannabis

1355
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:52,880
industry has managed to spread their

1356
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:55,489
pests throughout their own industry

1357
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,740
because you look at the cannabis aphid

1358
00:55:55,489 --> 00:56:01,250
which was somewhat isolated to the west

1359
00:55:57,739 --> 00:56:03,049
coast and now is everywhere on the East

1360
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:06,400
Coast and it's moved through people

1361
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:09,140
sharing plant material and cuts and

1362
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,789
they've the industry has done it to

1363
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:13,099
themselves they they've completely

1364
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:16,849
shared him present might across all US

1365
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:19,489
and Canada they've totally shared again

1366
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:20,900
the cannabis ef'n they've shared route a

1367
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,899
food because even though the Rudy but

1368
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:26,180
species we're dealing with has other

1369
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,950
hosts it's not something you're going to

1370
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:29,659
walk out and find in your yard like to

1371
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:32,299
spot spider mite yeah you find those

1372
00:56:29,659 --> 00:56:35,029
everywhere but you know these cannabis

1373
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:37,610
specific pests I mean everybody wants to

1374
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:39,920
blame the soil company you want to blame

1375
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:42,200
you know your neighbor but but the

1376
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,500
reality is is you brought in plants that

1377
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:47,659
were infected to begin with and so one

1378
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:50,150
of the things I you know where did your

1379
00:56:47,659 --> 00:56:51,859
plants come from look at your genetics

1380
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,769
if you came from the west coast it's a

1381
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,960
good chance you brought hemp Russert or

1382
00:56:53,769 --> 00:56:59,329
cannabis aphid right along with it

1383
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,550
where if someone's on the East Coast and

1384
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:03,829
like okay we're growing from seed then

1385
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:06,019
they're at very low risk of having

1386
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:07,309
cannabis aphid or hand press it might so

1387
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:09,230
I don't think there needs to be

1388
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:11,779
necessary preventive programs for them

1389
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:13,579
but again you know cuts from other

1390
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:15,650
production facilities especially if they

1391
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:18,259
originated wet West Coast man you better

1392
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:21,440
be prepared especially for him for us it

1393
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:23,570
might and that's that's the problem so I

1394
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,880
mean when I think about a program we we

1395
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:28,460
follow the genetics of the plants and

1396
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:31,030
what's their history and then that gives

1397
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:35,059
me you know what kind of risk are we at

1398
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:38,030
and so that's the first place I start

1399
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:39,980
and then you know we look at what their

1400
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,480
history of pests have been you know have

1401
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:44,449
you had problems the two spot spider

1402
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,210
mites have you had you know history of

1403
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:48,919
you know a fado what species and you

1404
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,789
know we look through that to try to put

1405
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,619
a program together

1406
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:53,929
and then always you know such a good

1407
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:56,359
scouting program so that if there is a

1408
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:59,299
new pest issue that pops up its detected

1409
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:01,490
early and then that way then we can get

1410
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:05,030
in and decide the best treatment method

1411
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:07,309
which often times when something new

1412
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:09,950
errs discovered you know it may be doing

1413
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:13,579
a knockdown spray maybe the best initial

1414
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:16,759
option unfortunately in most states

1415
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:18,170
what's allowed on cannabis the stuff has

1416
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,330
a previous in cannabis is our the very

1417
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:23,720
broad spectrum pesticides they're non

1418
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:25,849
selective in the sense that it kills

1419
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:28,789
good and bad and you know just kills

1420
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:30,799
everybody so often we after we spray we

1421
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:33,440
have to come in and then re-release all

1422
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,910
the beneficials where you look at

1423
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,500
industries again ornamentals and

1424
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:39,649
vegetables and you know we can be

1425
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,269
releasing parasitic wasps and we can be

1426
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:43,579
releasing predatory mites but if we have

1427
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:45,650
a flare-up of a to spot spider mite we

1428
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:47,179
can come in and there's this one

1429
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:48,920
chemistry it only kills like five

1430
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:51,199
species of spider mites and we can spray

1431
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,789
it over there it doesn't it only kills

1432
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,439
the two spot spider mites and their eggs

1433
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:55,940
it doesn't kill the predatory mites it

1434
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,849
doesn't kill the parasitoids it doesn't

1435
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:02,119
kill anything else and so that's what

1436
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:04,519
makes cannabis growing hard is that the

1437
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,769
few products you do have are non

1438
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:09,559
selective and they kill everything good

1439
00:59:06,769 --> 00:59:12,920
bad and indifferent and so that adds to

1440
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:16,119
the challenge there with with managing

1441
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,500
pests and putting programs together and

1442
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,719
honestly a lot of these products that

1443
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:23,320
you know are not EPA registered you

1444
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:26,239
don't really know even what's in them

1445
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:28,280
yeah and then we brought in the cannabis

1446
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:29,599
scene so many times that not everything

1447
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,420
that's in the product is even on the

1448
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:34,759
label nope and that's why you know I'm

1449
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:38,630
pretty preachy about using EPA

1450
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:40,730
registered pesticides you know and it

1451
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:43,820
was like oh my god pesticides but soaps

1452
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:46,309
and oils are pesticide only means it

1453
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:48,559
kills pests so a good horticultural oil

1454
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:52,070
can kill a pest but it's very safe for

1455
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:55,009
humans to use it's it's it's interesting

1456
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:56,690
because you see some products that have

1457
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,600
the same active ingredients and ones EPA

1458
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:01,579
registered and one may not be because

1459
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,500
sometimes people will still go ahead and

1460
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:04,880
EPA they'll go and register their

1461
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:08,300
products even though it's not required

1462
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:10,700
on some of these exempt products we keep

1463
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,740
on coming to this idea that either the

1464
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:16,460
research hasn't been done for cannabis

1465
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:20,389
or the products have not been that that

1466
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:23,030
at work well have not been you know

1467
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:25,849
properly crossed over to cannabis so one

1468
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:28,130
way or another cannabis is not on par

1469
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:29,889
with all of the work that's been done in

1470
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:33,920
ornamentals due to its historical

1471
01:00:29,889 --> 01:00:35,869
prohibition in your seat you kind of be

1472
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,940
are able to look both up and down the

1473
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:39,380
railway right you're able to look at

1474
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:42,050
where the cultivators are and the

1475
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,789
problems that they are experiencing but

1476
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:46,220
you're also able to look upstream at the

1477
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:48,380
vendors who would you know theoretically

1478
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:49,699
be selling these solutions to

1479
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,470
cultivators because they're the same

1480
01:00:49,699 --> 01:00:54,079
folks that are selling solutions into

1481
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:56,119
ornamental what are you seeing are you

1482
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,849
seeing that these companies are like oh

1483
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,559
my god cannabis is going to be so

1484
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:03,469
valuable and so now they are all

1485
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:06,799
hardcore moving into research to cross

1486
01:01:03,469 --> 01:01:09,439
apply these these solutions and to come

1487
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,550
up with new products or are they kind of

1488
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,900
sitting on their hands because they

1489
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:14,030
don't necessarily want to play with

1490
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,200
cannabis folk well it's not that they

1491
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:18,980
don't want to play with cannabis put

1492
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:21,589
folk when you just look at sheer acreage

1493
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:25,400
of cannabis in the United States there's

1494
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:28,700
not much realistically and whether it's

1495
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,260
a cannabis plant or it's a cornfield if

1496
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:32,000
you're going to use traditional

1497
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:35,240
pesticides it's generally going to be

1498
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,059
this that per acre the same amount of

1499
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:40,399
spray so if you develop products for

1500
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:43,039
corn you're going to be able to sell an

1501
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:47,420
insane amount of chemistry if you're

1502
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,550
going to sell to a you know cannabis you

1503
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:51,950
know there's the markets in a way not

1504
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:54,920
there it's not worth their time because

1505
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:56,629
they're not going to get the the money

1506
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:01,210
this is the exact same problem actually

1507
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:03,349
ornamentals have and realistically

1508
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:05,539
ornamentals when you look at pesticide

1509
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:08,299
usage over all they use a very small

1510
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:10,849
amount and so really the products often

1511
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:13,730
we get in ornamentals are ones that were

1512
01:02:10,849 --> 01:02:15,799
developed for you know soybeans corn you

1513
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,449
know big AG and then they're like okay

1514
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,390
can there be

1515
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:21,189
application in ornamentals for this and

1516
01:02:19,389 --> 01:02:23,650
then they see if they can make them fit

1517
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:26,559
because again overall the ornamental

1518
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:29,880
market is still really not a big

1519
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:33,849
business as far as big AG is concerned

1520
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:39,010
compared to you know again corn soybeans

1521
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:41,380
or even just turf and so cannabis will

1522
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:43,450
probably sister right along with

1523
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:45,838
ornamentals and be considered a

1524
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:49,299
specialty crop kind of like cut herbs

1525
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:51,299
and that basically in ornamental again

1526
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:55,480
we just kind of get the crumbs in a way

1527
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:57,490
now we still get good products but you

1528
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:00,699
know when we get a new pass like right

1529
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:04,149
now in Florida we're dealing with this

1530
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:06,039
hibiscus bud weevil is any chemical

1531
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:08,139
company going to take the time to

1532
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:09,969
develop a chemistry that's going to take

1533
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:12,639
ten years it's going to cost millions

1534
01:03:09,969 --> 01:03:14,709
and millions of dollars to treat for

1535
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,420
that pest absolutely not because they'll

1536
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:19,059
never get the return on it and it's the

1537
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:20,680
same thing in cannabis its I don't think

1538
01:03:19,059 --> 01:03:23,559
it has nothing to do with the fact it's

1539
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:27,940
cannabis it has to do with shear acreage

1540
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:30,190
now if outdoor hemp ever gets to the

1541
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:32,858
levels being grown that like corn

1542
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:34,300
soybeans wheat you know and all that's

1543
01:03:32,858 --> 01:03:36,759
being grown at well then they'll

1544
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:39,280
definitely be products for that market

1545
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,349
and then it will probably be looked at

1546
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,619
see okay can we get a specialty label

1547
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:47,318
for yeah it'll trickle down to THC

1548
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:50,980
products yes yeah that's exactly what

1549
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:52,088
will happen and you know I see mixed

1550
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,519
growers out there too because there are

1551
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:56,889
some growers that will just never use a

1552
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:58,719
synthetic pesticide on cannabis you know

1553
01:03:56,889 --> 01:04:00,549
that's just and that's fine you know

1554
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,439
that's I'm not judging anybody there are

1555
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,519
other people that are like oh my god I

1556
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,220
can't wait till we have registered

1557
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:09,280
pesticides to make this growing a lot

1558
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:10,750
easier I mean you know you have people

1559
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,160
all the way across the board and some

1560
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:15,400
people are in the middle and just like

1561
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:18,190
you know just give me what works and so

1562
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:21,010
it will be interesting to see how if it

1563
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:23,260
ever you know we need to it's all the

1564
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:25,450
legal stuff becoming federally legal so

1565
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:27,760
that the EPA can register products and

1566
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:30,369
and all that stuff but even if then

1567
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,440
let's just say tomorrow that EPA

1568
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:37,089
products could be registered through the

1569
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:40,900
EPA for indoor cannabis it's still going

1570
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:42,519
to be years before products will readily

1571
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:45,130
come available we might be able to get

1572
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:47,050
some special use labels which can be

1573
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:48,880
pushed through and those you know our

1574
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,740
temporary use labels but you still need

1575
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,450
research to back up that it's safe and

1576
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:56,139
cuz you know cannabis is somewhat

1577
01:04:52,449 --> 01:05:00,189
considered more of a food crop my guess

1578
01:04:56,139 --> 01:05:02,019
is though is that probably the tobacco

1579
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:04,659
companies have already been doing a lot

1580
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:06,489
of testing and they probably got a lot

1581
01:05:04,659 --> 01:05:09,460
of research already in their back pocket

1582
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:11,979
just waiting that we don't know about

1583
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:13,599
because it's you know still a lot of

1584
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,490
secret secret stuff because there is big

1585
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,110
money in this and I think there's

1586
01:05:15,489 --> 01:05:20,169
probably more research done than anybody

1587
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:22,030
knows but you can't publicly let anybody

1588
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,110
know you've done the research right they

1589
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:25,630
don't want to they don't want to give up

1590
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:27,700
their position or or suggest what

1591
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,530
they're working on IPU eyes sounds like

1592
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:30,969
for the for the time being we're going

1593
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:34,120
to be putting together like various

1594
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:37,029
biological hacks and and paying higher

1595
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:38,859
prices when products do come out so

1596
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:40,690
let's go ahead and take our last short

1597
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,490
break you are listening to shaping fire

1598
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:45,119
and my guest today is entomologist

1599
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:47,799
Suzanne Wainwright Evans the bug lady

1600
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,659
one of the reasons why no-till cannabis

1601
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,490
growing is so valued by farmers is

1602
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:53,529
because the mycelium networks in the

1603
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:55,719
soil remain established from year to

1604
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:57,700
year and we know these fungal networks

1605
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:59,949
are essential because they are the

1606
01:05:57,699 --> 01:06:01,659
nutrient super highways that extend far

1607
01:05:59,949 --> 01:06:02,259
and wide in the substrate to feed your

1608
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:04,960
plants

1609
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:07,120
the trouble with growing in new soils or

1610
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,190
blended cocoa substrates is that it

1611
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:12,069
takes most of the plant's life just to

1612
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:14,650
create these mycelium highways Dino

1613
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:17,140
Michael endo mycorrhizal fungi inoculant

1614
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:19,750
reduces that time and gets your plant

1615
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:22,389
eating a wider array of nutrients faster

1616
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:24,130
and it's three times the concentration

1617
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:27,549
of the current leading brand in the u.s.

1618
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:29,500
at 900 propagules per gram of - fungal

1619
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:32,200
species selected specifically for

1620
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:34,480
cannabis cultivation this new product

1621
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:36,219
called Dino mica is the result of 30

1622
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,809
years of research and trials at the

1623
01:06:36,219 --> 01:06:40,209
volcanic a Greek ultra Research

1624
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:42,429
Institute in Israel it has also been

1625
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,429
vigorously trialed by cannabis and food

1626
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:45,169
growers

1627
01:06:43,429 --> 01:06:47,509
the us since the product first arrived

1628
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:49,700

1660
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:08,210
nutrients we want to be sure that our

1661

1673
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:45,409
deep to personally vet each product for

1674
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:47,059
quality and determine that there isn't a

1675
01:08:45,409 --> 01:08:49,818
better version of the product that he

worlds for many greenhouse operators

though building their greenhouse before

1704
01:09:52,849 --> 01:09:56,869
gaining insight into how cannabis

1705
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:00,230
greenhouses differ from ornamental crops

challenges facing cannabis greenhouses

and how to overcome them in episode

number 41 of the shaping fire podcast no

1723
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,908
matter where I go in the country good

1724
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:43,010
people with smart backgrounds still are

1725
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:45,170
making the mistake of building without

1726
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:47,500
knowing cannabis and it causes them to

1727
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:50,389
burn through capital and time fast

1728
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:52,460
everyone has their own failure point for

1729
01:10:50,389 --> 01:10:54,469
some it is improper ventilation planning

1730
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:56,210
for others it is surface temperatures of

1731
01:10:54,469 --> 01:10:58,310
the building or the plant's leaves or

1732
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,750
both some folks that build their

1733
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:01,550
greenhouse from scratch make really

1734
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:03,289
basic errors like placement of the

1735
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,550
greenhouse on the property or not

1736
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:06,170
understanding the natural environment

1737
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:08,480
where the greenhouse sits

1738
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:10,460
some have even built a decent greenhouse

1739
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,199
but are inefficient in their deploy

1740
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:14,439
of light deprivation techniques and

1741
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:16,789
never really hit their target yields

1742
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:18,649
it's great when you learn from your

1743
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:20,810
mistakes but it's even better when you

1744
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:23,000
learn from the mistakes of others when

1745
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:24,650
you bring on green house advisory group

1746
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,569
you will learn from the mistakes of

1747

their many clients and you'll take

1748

welcome back you are listening to

1760
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,569
shaping fire I'm your host Shengo Louis

1761
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,390
and our guest this week is entomologist

1762
01:11:56,569 --> 01:12:01,939
Suzanne Wainwright Evans the bug lady so

1763
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:04,460
let's take a one-step back to the end of

1764
01:12:01,939 --> 01:12:07,969
the last set Suzanne we were talking

1765
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:09,469
about the cost associated with buying

1766
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:11,630
these products and I kind of make this

1767
01:12:09,469 --> 01:12:14,060
you know off off-the-cuff comment at the

1768
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:16,159
end as before going to break that you

1769
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:18,110
know we people in cannabis are used to

1770
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:20,210
paying more for things we call you know

1771
01:12:18,109 --> 01:12:21,619
the green tax right that we all have to

1772
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,270
pay a little bit more for things because

1773
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:25,519
there hasn't been a lot of research done

1774
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:27,680
on a lot of the products that we need

1775
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,780
and everybody kind of because the

1776
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:31,219
cannabis is taboo nature everybody

1777
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:32,929
thinks they can kind of stick it to us a

1778
01:12:31,219 --> 01:12:34,670
little bit but during the break you're

1779
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:36,079
all like yeah and cannabis people don't

1780
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:37,520
really know how to shop right and I'm

1781
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:39,890
like whoa now that's an interesting

1782
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:42,350
thought so let's break that out for

1783
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:44,270
everybody to hear huh what are your best

1784
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:46,219
practices that cannabis folks should

1785
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:48,020
know about how to shop for these

1786
01:12:46,219 --> 01:12:51,800
solutions to get the most bang for their

1787
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:54,620
buck so yeah so what I find is why I

1788
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,300
call it the cannabis tax which just you

1789
01:12:54,619 --> 01:12:58,430
know bug lady consulting does not charge

1790
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:00,110
cannabis tax on consulting I charge the

1791
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:02,390
same fee whether your ornamental

1792
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:04,729
vegetables or cannabis we appreciate

1793
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:06,619
that season yes well I mean it's to me

1794
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:08,238
it's I mean and I know I get haters this

1795
01:13:06,619 --> 01:13:10,250
too but to me it's just another crop I

1796
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:13,039
mean it's just another crop let's solve

1797
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:17,420
the problem and you know move on but as

1798
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:19,760
far as the economics so yes people think

1799
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:21,079
that they can charge more to the

1800
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,270
cannabis industry because there's this

1801
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:24,170
idea that they can afford it I don't

1802
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,730
think they can

1803
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:28,579
because you know prices get I mean

1804
01:13:25,729 --> 01:13:32,569
there's more competition and growers

1805
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:34,729
need to learn to grow without saying to

1806
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:37,159
me it doesn't matter how much it costs

1807
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:39,079
please do not say that to me because it

1808
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:41,510
always matters how much it costs because

1809
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:43,149
again you need to turn a profit if you

1810
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:46,220
want your business to stay in business

1811
01:13:43,149 --> 01:13:49,389
what I recommend to my growers is that

1812
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:53,060
when you need to buy products especially

1813
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:55,910
let's say spray products you guys all

1814
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:57,410
know I love with products off oil acts

1815
01:13:55,909 --> 01:13:59,989
it's one of my favorite things okay you

1816
01:13:57,409 --> 01:14:02,510
need to buy a product well don't go just

1817
01:13:59,989 --> 01:14:04,300
on the internet and in search and this

1818
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:06,860
are there you need to get connected with

1819
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:08,659
traditional horticultural supply

1820
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,779
companies that have been servicing

1821
01:14:08,659 --> 01:14:15,289
greenhouses and nurseries for years

1822
01:14:11,779 --> 01:14:18,159
those tend to have your better pricing

1823
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:20,600
because you're going to pay a premium

1824
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:22,159
generally I mean occasionally you can

1825
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:26,410
find a good price on the internet but

1826
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:29,389
generally those companies are going to

1827
01:14:26,409 --> 01:14:32,659
work with you with these products and

1828
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:35,240
get you better pricing also I mean I've

1829
01:14:32,659 --> 01:14:38,239
had numerous heart attacks over the

1830
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:39,859
years looking at biocontrol agents and

1831
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,349
what some of these cannabis people have

1832
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:44,719
been paying you know a sachet that

1833
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:47,590
should cost you know maybe 15 cents I've

1834
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:51,409
seen cannabis people paying $2 through

1835
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:54,860
distributors I know

1836
01:14:51,409 --> 01:14:56,449
again this always frustrates some people

1837
01:14:54,859 --> 01:14:59,329
but I you know when it comes to buying

1838
01:14:56,449 --> 01:15:02,449
the biocontrol agents I think it's

1839
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:05,510
important to attempt to buy them direct

1840
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:07,760
from the insec Therese because generally

1841
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:09,470
you're going to get the best pricing the

1842
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,090
bugs are going to come directly to you

1843
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:12,590
from the in Sector II and you tend to

1844
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:15,319
get better information because those

1845
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:17,569
people are the most part trained on

1846
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:19,699
their products I mean just as in the

1847
01:15:17,569 --> 01:15:21,859
industry there's some you know idiots

1848
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:22,849
out there but for the most part that's

1849
01:15:21,859 --> 01:15:25,609
where you're going to get your best

1850
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:27,770
information pricing also when you call

1851
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:30,259
and ask for pricing because for the

1852
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:33,110
biocontrol agents you are not going to

1853
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:36,260
find pricing for them online if you are

1854
01:15:33,109 --> 01:15:37,299
a commercial grower or a larger hobby

1855
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:39,010
grower

1856
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,539
you know call them and you know give

1857
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:42,159
them your size and say you know this is

1858
01:15:40,539 --> 01:15:45,158
how much you know we're planning on

1859
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:48,339
doing and so that way you can get grower

1860
01:15:45,158 --> 01:15:52,149
pricing not necessarily you know retail

1861
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:53,710
pricing off a website because again it's

1862
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:55,388
unbelievable some of the prices that are

1863
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:57,219
charged on some of these retail websites

1864
01:15:55,389 --> 01:16:01,389
that our distributors for biocontrol

1865
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:05,170
agents so do your shopping and this is a

1866
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:07,150
something that I recommend again to all

1867
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:08,649
my growers is and you can't do it this

1868
01:16:07,149 --> 01:16:13,000
year because everything's canceled this

1869
01:16:08,649 --> 01:16:15,219
year but get to you know horticultural

1870
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,770
trade shows too and that way you can get

1871
01:16:15,219 --> 01:16:19,359
connected with the horticultural again

1872
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:22,869
professional companies that have been

1873
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:26,019
around a long time that sell at what I

1874
01:16:22,868 --> 01:16:27,969
call fair pricing you know know are all

1875
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,800
cannabis distributors get price gouging

1876
01:16:27,969 --> 01:16:33,550
absolutely not but is it happening

1877
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:35,949
absolutely it is so just get connected

1878
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:37,570
with you know these I don't say older

1879
01:16:35,948 --> 01:16:42,098
that sounds bad but you know as well

1880
01:16:37,569 --> 01:16:44,698
established companies that you know can

1881
01:16:42,099 --> 01:16:47,949
provide you biocontrol agents and

1882
01:16:44,698 --> 01:16:50,348
chemistry's at you know reasonable

1883
01:16:47,948 --> 01:16:52,178
pricing but I guess I should have said

1884
01:16:50,349 --> 01:16:54,130
it that way the the the spray products

1885
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:56,380
fertilizers soils and things like that

1886
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:57,789
but again the biocontrol agents I think

1887
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,010
are a bit better coming direct from the

1888
01:16:57,789 --> 01:17:01,590
insectary it sounds like to that a lot

1889
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:04,840
of these companies don't have their

1890
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:07,779
their priceless online and so it's well

1891
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,880
worth adding the extra step to email

1892
01:17:07,779 --> 01:17:11,559
them and ask for a price list even

1893
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,750
though all of us you know want

1894
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:15,730
convenience because by the time you know

1895
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:18,130
after the after the day in the green

1896
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:19,629
house or out outside by the time you get

1897
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:21,010
around to shopping for this stuff it's

1898
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:23,050
probably in the evening after your

1899
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:24,670
dinner and folks really want a fast

1900
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:28,320
solution and it sounds like what you're

1901
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:30,489
saying is don't just buy from the the

1902
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,139
cheapest ecommerce site that you can

1903
01:17:30,488 --> 01:17:34,569
find because there's probably going to

1904
01:17:32,139 --> 01:17:36,309
be more middlemen there and really it's

1905
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:38,319
worth the extra effort to write to the

1906
01:17:36,309 --> 01:17:40,719
company get their priceless or catalogue

1907
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:42,519
add that extra step because you'll be

1908
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,639
creating a relationship where you'll be

1909
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:47,050
paying less for a product over time

1910
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:48,730
right yes and so I mean it's one thing

1911
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:50,690
if oh my gosh we just need this product

1912
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:52,218
fine pay whatever to get it but

1913
01:17:50,689 --> 01:17:53,539
you know if you know especially with

1914
01:17:52,219 --> 01:17:55,010
things like fertilizer I mean you're

1915
01:17:53,539 --> 01:17:57,079
going to do that over and over and over

1916
01:17:55,010 --> 01:18:00,140
and over again and you need to get some

1917
01:17:57,079 --> 01:18:03,859
with somebody that you know is is going

1918
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:06,350
to provide I would say fair pricing

1919
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:08,929
again I mean I just can't believe some

1920
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:11,780
of the the markups I've seen like I'm

1921
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:13,760
Priscilla's I saw online I think was $85

1922
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:17,389
for 2004 similes where you can get them

1923
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:19,010
from an insect reef or 15 yeah yeah yeah

1924
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:20,840
there's there's a lot of there's a lot

1925
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:24,949
of hustle going on in our scene right

1926
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:26,390
now I your comment on when you need it

1927
01:18:24,948 --> 01:18:28,039
fast you know sometimes you just have to

1928
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:30,410
get it and you'd pay a higher price and

1929
01:18:28,039 --> 01:18:32,600
you go and I was thinking about the same

1930
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:34,789
thing about banker and trap plants for

1931
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:36,949
example people who are at this point in

1932
01:18:34,789 --> 01:18:38,810
the season and they're hearing this

1933
01:18:36,948 --> 01:18:42,829
episode and they're like oh I think I

1934
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:46,100
want to add some some you know helpful

1935
01:18:42,829 --> 01:18:48,829
companion plants to the garden before

1936
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:52,850
the season's over and so you know you

1937
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:55,579
recommend insightfully that you should

1938
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:58,730
probably start with a seed so you are

1939
01:18:55,579 --> 01:19:01,279
growing your own and you know that it's

1940
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:06,169
not bringing in any pesticides with it

1941
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:08,479
however if people want to bring in a you

1942
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:09,710
know pre you know starts or pre

1943
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,709
established plants

1944
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:15,469
is there a way for that to be reasonably

1945
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:18,500
done or are you saying across the board

1946
01:19:15,469 --> 01:19:22,969
do not do this because it's a total mess

1947
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:27,409
to try I think it's a huge risk because

1948
01:19:22,969 --> 01:19:29,300
I you know I I needed a foods what did I

1949
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:30,649
do I went down to my local garden center

1950
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,829
and bought some pepper plants because

1951
01:19:30,649 --> 01:19:35,710
you know what they had a fits on them

1952
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:37,819
you know you could count on it

1953
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:39,230
pretty much the thing is it's it's

1954
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:41,000
interesting though you know when the

1955
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:42,619
plants are grown in densities like that

1956
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,149
they have pest issues you plant those

1957
01:19:42,619 --> 01:19:45,800
peppers out and if you put them in your

1958
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:47,929
yard David's are going to be gone in a

1959
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,610
few days because ladybirds surface

1960
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:52,909
everybody comes in and cleans them out

1961
01:19:49,609 --> 01:19:55,729
you put them inside my guest bedroom

1962
01:19:52,909 --> 01:19:59,238
window and those aphids thrive to the

1963
01:19:55,729 --> 01:20:01,189
point you couldn't even see you couldn't

1964
01:19:59,238 --> 01:20:02,238
even see the plant through all the EFA's

1965
01:20:01,189 --> 01:20:04,009
it's very interesting because I did I

1966
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:04,279
went down bought a bunch of plants but

1967
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,600
some

1968
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:09,199
the garden put some in the guest room

1969
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,630
and the ones outside are you know three

1970
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:12,710
feet tall and dark green leaves and the

1971
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:14,869
ones in the guest room are just

1972
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:16,340
encrusted in aphids it just shows you

1973
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:18,229
the difference between indoor and

1974
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:20,060
outdoor growing when just left to its

1975
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:22,250
own because outside mother nature came

1976
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:25,190
in and took care of it and as clean as

1977
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:27,380
you think those plants are they're gonna

1978
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:29,269
have something and you know alyssum it

1979
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:30,109
can have thrips in it there's no doubt

1980
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:35,360
about that

1981
01:20:30,109 --> 01:20:37,399
but you know the generally outside it

1982
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:40,670
will bring in aureus which helps keep

1983
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:43,489
the thrips level below what we call an

1984
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:45,770
economic threshold if you were to just

1985
01:20:43,489 --> 01:20:48,079
buy a lisam and bring in thrips with no

1986
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:50,180
aureus you bring them into your grow you

1987
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:51,439
close the door what's going to happen

1988
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:52,970
with those thrips the numbers are

1989
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:55,909
probably going to go up and depending on

1990
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:58,430
what species they may move into your

1991
01:20:55,909 --> 01:21:01,460
cannabis so that's why starting them

1992
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:04,520
from seed so they're clean from the

1993
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:07,159
beginning again it's really high-risk

1994
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:09,410
and again often times when people

1995
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:11,000
contact me they already know they're in

1996
01:21:09,409 --> 01:21:13,880
the dog house because they brought

1997
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:17,090
plants in they shouldn't have done and

1998
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,510
usually it's you know that oh my

1999
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:19,159
neighbor

2000
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:20,720
you know just needed me or my friend

2001
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:23,359
need me to watch these couple plants for

2002
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:26,539
him while he was out of town and roof so

2003
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:28,130
this way I really push with commercial

2004
01:21:26,539 --> 01:21:30,769
growing facilities to have a quarantine

2005
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:33,170
area it let's say you absolutely had to

2006
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:35,840
bring either cannabis in or another

2007
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:38,480
plant at least hold it for a week or two

2008
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:42,110
separate so you can watch it and see if

2009
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:43,729
any pest problems do develop but you

2010
01:21:42,109 --> 01:21:45,739
know for alyssum and pepper

2011
01:21:43,729 --> 01:21:50,109
I would absolutely grow those from seed

2012
01:21:45,739 --> 01:21:52,579
and we actually again you know back to

2013
01:21:50,109 --> 01:21:54,679
what we do in ornamentals which is

2014
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:56,600
interesting because in ornamentals you

2015
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,250
know what we do we look to the vegetable

2016
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,710
industry to see what they do to manage

2017
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:02,029
pests and then adapt it to what we can

2018
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:03,560
do for ornamentals and that's what

2019
01:22:02,029 --> 01:22:05,479
cannabis is doing now we're looking to

2020
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,580
ornamentals to see how we can adapt it

2021
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:11,239
for that crop so there's a lot of us

2022
01:22:07,579 --> 01:22:12,619
looking across the fence and developing

2023
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:15,769
these systems because the Banger plant

2024
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:17,609
systems were more looked at for

2025
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:19,740
vegetable production and then

2026
01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:22,079
ornamental guys kind of shanghaied it

2027
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:23,489
and now the the canvas guys are going to

2028
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:25,800
Shanghai which is fine this is what we

2029
01:22:23,489 --> 01:22:27,779
do look to other cropping systems and

2030
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:30,659
adapt it for our growing situation but

2031
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:34,139
for threats because you know I did get a

2032
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:35,369
ton of people in the spring contact me

2033
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:37,140
about three ups especially on the west

2034
01:22:35,369 --> 01:22:39,119
coast and when I was out traveling in

2035
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,280
January in February on the west coast I

2036
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:43,769
saw a lot of thrips out there so if we

2037
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:46,500
like the thrifts banker plants weather

2038
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:49,230
it well with the peppers we actually

2039
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:51,300
start our peppers in winter that's when

2040
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:54,809
we start our seeds because we really

2041
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:58,020
want them blooming and having pollen and

2042
01:22:54,810 --> 01:23:00,539
nectar by February March again depending

2043
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,770
on where you are in the US and then as

2044
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:03,750
soon as they're blooming we start

2045
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:07,800
inoculating them with the aureus the

2046
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:10,289
minut pirate bug so the time you know I

2047
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,449
will say the northern region we'll just

2048
01:23:10,289 --> 01:23:15,060
talk about that for right now wakes up

2049
01:23:12,449 --> 01:23:17,429
with insects and we start having thrips

2050
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:19,560
issues in early spring you already have

2051
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:22,320
the standing army of aureus all ready to

2052
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:25,680
go you don't start your seeds in

2053
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:27,719
springtime necessarily we actually start

2054
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:30,539
the Banger plants before we start our

2055
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:32,190
actual crops in spring so I know there's

2056
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:33,720
somebody out here curious about this so

2057
01:23:32,189 --> 01:23:36,539
I'm going to go one more step down this

2058
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:39,420
path and say we often will bring in

2059
01:23:36,539 --> 01:23:41,489
clones from other people that we've got

2060
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:45,060
a question alene garden and we'll do

2061
01:23:41,489 --> 01:23:49,019
some sort of dip can we simply dip these

2062
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:51,660
incoming banker plants and the same way

2063
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:53,250
that we would a clone or does that not

2064
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:55,170
work the same way because there's such a

2065
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:59,100
wide variety of pests that could be on

2066
01:23:55,170 --> 01:24:00,449
them well so the the dips again there's

2067
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:03,539
different dips for different target

2068
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:05,909
pests and for things like thrips the

2069
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:09,479
eggs are inside a plant tissue so dips

2070
01:24:05,909 --> 01:24:13,199
aren't going to do anything for that so

2071
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:17,849
just just to get that out there um you

2072
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:20,189
you can um you could dip them I'd be

2073
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:21,750
very careful about doing it because like

2074
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:24,169
I don't think there's been any dipping

2075
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:27,210
research done on Alyssa and ELISA like

2076
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:30,060
grow so fast I mean you really there's

2077
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:31,390
no need to I mean you can just grow it

2078
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:34,030
and also the dipping

2079
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:35,590
kill the pests but again you don't know

2080
01:24:34,029 --> 01:24:39,759
if they've been treated with a pesticide

2081
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:43,300
a systemic now this is the really kind

2082
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,980
of weird not weird thing but most if you

2083
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:46,210
had to go buy something then you

2084
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:48,489
absolutely had no choice

2085
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:50,199
honestly I would probably go to a big

2086
01:24:48,489 --> 01:24:51,849
box store and buy them over an

2087
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:53,829
independent garden center and I know I

2088
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:58,810
can hear all the haters already you ask

2089
01:24:53,829 --> 01:25:01,390
why well because the growers that I work

2090
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:05,890
with that sell to big box stores like

2091
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:08,380
Lowe's Home Depot Walmart they are not

2092
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:11,110
allowed anymore to use neo Knick

2093
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:13,480
pesticides the systemic pesticides which

2094
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:17,199
can cause a lot of problems with things

2095
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:20,139
like aureus where independent garden

2096
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:24,929
centers have no restrictions on using

2097
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:30,270
that kind of stuff so you are probably

2098
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:33,100
safer that using again something from a

2099
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:35,200
big-box retail place because they have

2100
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,579
more restrictions on pesticide use

2101
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:38,500
now I'm sure I'm going to get some hater

2102
01:25:36,579 --> 01:25:40,689
emails saying well we're independent we

2103
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,520
don't use neo Nick yes there's going to

2104
01:25:40,689 --> 01:25:44,769
be independents that don't but they

2105
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:47,530
don't have any restrictions on them

2106
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:50,050
we're the guys that sell to the big box

2107
01:25:47,529 --> 01:25:54,609
stores do and I work close with a lot of

2108
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:56,110
them and I you know we can't use Neo

2109
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:57,159
Nicks they're gone from their programs

2110
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:59,199
and what they've done is they've really

2111
01:25:57,159 --> 01:26:01,899
stepped up their bio control program

2112
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:04,449
some of these larger greenhouses I work

2113
01:26:01,899 --> 01:26:07,420
with a metro line is one it's a hundred

2114
01:26:04,449 --> 01:26:10,329
and eighty acre greenhouse when they get

2115
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:12,369
their bio control agents they're coming

2116
01:26:10,329 --> 01:26:16,210
on pallets because they're using so many

2117
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:20,109
of them these days um I know that one of

2118
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:23,020
the things that I dare say annoys you is

2119
01:26:20,109 --> 01:26:25,449
that when when folks see challenges in

2120
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:28,150
their garden they immediately assume

2121
01:26:25,449 --> 01:26:30,819
that it's pass and you know I've heard

2122
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:33,039
you point out multiple times that we

2123
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:35,049
need to know more about diseases too

2124
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:38,140
because more often than not it's

2125
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:43,520
actually a disease vector instead of a

2126
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:45,860
pest vector would you speak to that yeah

2127
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,210
again please don't hate me I'm doing

2128
01:26:45,859 --> 01:26:49,989
this because I'm trying to help the

2129
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:53,289
industry but you know the overall

2130
01:26:49,989 --> 01:26:56,829
knowledge level of cannabis growers

2131
01:26:53,289 --> 01:27:01,069
really needs to be elevated higher on on

2132
01:26:56,829 --> 01:27:03,019
on on being more technical

2133
01:27:01,069 --> 01:27:04,489
unfortunately what a lot of people do is

2134
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:08,660
they look at a problem and then they try

2135
01:27:04,489 --> 01:27:11,000
to match pictures online and most I will

2136
01:27:08,659 --> 01:27:15,079
say most of the diagnostic images online

2137
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,930
for cannabis are wrong and you know

2138
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:20,689
everybody's quick to blame things on

2139
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:24,590
insects because insects are more visible

2140
01:27:20,689 --> 01:27:28,009
where pathogens can be a lot harder to

2141
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:29,659
diagnose and so a lot of the times you

2142
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:31,489
know I get images they're like oh what's

2143
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:33,739
you know making these dark spots on my

2144
01:27:31,489 --> 01:27:35,840
leaves what insects doing this what - I

2145
01:27:33,739 --> 01:27:37,849
do I sprayed it well no it's a disease

2146
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,289
problem you know for me at Iowa's it's

2147
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:42,560
not my department doesn't have six or

2148
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:44,229
eight legs you know it's it's it needs

2149
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:47,860
to be dealt with by a plant pathologist

2150
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:50,629
and there aren't many you know actually

2151
01:27:47,859 --> 01:27:52,519
educated like when I say educated I mean

2152
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:54,650
like went to college for this

2153
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:56,060
entomologist working in hemp and

2154
01:27:54,649 --> 01:27:58,849
cannabis there are definitely some of us

2155
01:27:56,060 --> 01:28:02,120
around but there's not many and there's

2156
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:03,710
even fewer plant pathologists and so

2157
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:05,119
this is the problem it's hard to get

2158
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:07,340
good information but there's a lot of

2159
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:09,949
guessing and unfortunately people will

2160
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:12,710
just post pictures on Instagram or

2161
01:28:09,949 --> 01:28:14,059
there's lots of Facebook groups and you

2162
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:15,800
know what's wrong with my plant and I'll

2163
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:17,240
scroll through and you'll see 40

2164
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,420
different answers and none of them are

2165
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:23,179
right or you may not be able to diagnose

2166
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:25,970
the problem from the image because

2167
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:28,340
oftentimes with nutrition you know you

2168
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:31,159
need to send in for leaf tissue analysis

2169
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:35,150
to get a report of what's actually going

2170
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:37,340
on in your foliage or in your soil and

2171
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:40,189
you know it kind of folds into nutrition

2172
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:42,260
too because people think oh we've got

2173
01:28:40,189 --> 01:28:45,019
insect problems no that's a nutritional

2174
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:47,960
problem and you know I talk to people

2175
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:50,690
about you know soil I mean again

2176
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,430
agronomy is not my wheelhouse at all I

2177
01:28:50,689 --> 01:28:55,069
mean I took it in college and everything

2178
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:56,600
and I know not be dangerous but you know

2179
01:28:55,069 --> 01:28:57,469
I'm finding that people don't really

2180
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:01,429
understand

2181
01:28:57,469 --> 01:29:03,498
and you know pH cation exchange capacity

2182
01:29:01,429 --> 01:29:06,408
people don't know how to do poor through

2183
01:29:03,498 --> 01:29:08,179
tests people aren't getting their water

2184
01:29:06,408 --> 01:29:11,058
tested they're not getting their soils

2185
01:29:08,179 --> 01:29:12,769
tested and and granted you know a home

2186
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:15,199
gardener who's growing three or four

2187
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:17,539
plants probably not going to you know go

2188
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:19,279
through those steps but anything larger

2189
01:29:17,538 --> 01:29:21,288
than that if you want to become a good

2190
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:24,078
grower you really need to have good

2191
01:29:21,288 --> 01:29:24,828
analysis done to really know what the

2192
01:29:24,078 --> 01:29:28,189
problem is

2193
01:29:24,828 --> 01:29:29,719
then you know for the next time and for

2194
01:29:28,189 --> 01:29:32,299
me personally in my career the stuff I

2195
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:34,010
work with the insect identification is

2196
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:36,619
what I learned in college I learned

2197
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:39,320
basic insect biology and that kind of

2198
01:29:36,618 --> 01:29:41,598
stuff but the actual problems I deal

2199
01:29:39,319 --> 01:29:43,248
with is is stuff I faced over the last

2200
01:29:41,599 --> 01:29:45,110
thirty years and when I didn't know what

2201
01:29:43,248 --> 01:29:47,059
it was an insect termite

2202
01:29:45,109 --> 01:29:49,868
I'd send it off for ID and then I would

2203
01:29:47,059 --> 01:29:52,969
know the next time and so I've learned

2204
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:57,679
through you know getting more educated

2205
01:29:52,969 --> 01:30:00,498
by using diagnostic labs and and and

2206
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:03,618
helped and that's what's going to make

2207
01:30:00,498 --> 01:30:05,300
you a better grower not guessing that

2208
01:30:03,618 --> 01:30:07,339
you think you knew what the problem is

2209
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:12,349
but really finding out really what the

2210
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:14,029
problem is and now since hemp has opened

2211
01:30:12,349 --> 01:30:14,569
up you know through the farm bill and

2212
01:30:14,029 --> 01:30:17,029
Papa

2213
01:30:14,569 --> 01:30:19,429
if you collect your insects you can send

2214
01:30:17,029 --> 01:30:20,748
them in and get them identified also you

2215
01:30:19,429 --> 01:30:22,038
don't always have to you know with

2216
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:24,738
extension you don't have to put what the

2217
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:26,630
host plant is but a lot of extension now

2218
01:30:24,738 --> 01:30:28,069
is working with hemp and you can say

2219
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:29,868
okay these are my pests off my hemp crop

2220
01:30:28,069 --> 01:30:32,599
you know what are they and you can get

2221
01:30:29,868 --> 01:30:36,018
the proper identification and there's

2222
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:38,719
more testing labs that are doing you

2223
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:41,780
know hemp leaf tissue analysis stuff so

2224
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:43,670
these these places are out there to help

2225
01:30:41,779 --> 01:30:46,429
you it's just the industry needs to take

2226
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:49,489
advantage of them I think it's going to

2227
01:30:46,429 --> 01:30:52,279
be very interesting to see the the new

2228
01:30:49,488 --> 01:30:54,589
skill sets that the next generation of

2229
01:30:52,279 --> 01:30:56,719
cultivators are going to have you know

2230
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:59,059
the the young whippersnappers who are

2231
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:01,819
like in their early 20s and they have

2232
01:30:59,059 --> 01:31:03,979
hit their you know age of majority at

2233
01:31:01,819 --> 01:31:05,899
the perfect time when cannabis is coming

2234
01:31:03,979 --> 01:31:09,019
out of prohibition and so they're able

2235
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:10,609
to actually go to university for you

2236
01:31:09,019 --> 01:31:12,710
know these types of

2237
01:31:10,609 --> 01:31:16,039
you know diagnostic and pests and

2238
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:18,469
agricultural aspects and then come up

2239
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:21,800
and spend their entire life of

2240
01:31:18,469 --> 01:31:23,929
cultivating cannabis with the you know

2241
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:27,050
professional supports and education and

2242
01:31:23,929 --> 01:31:31,639
versus those of us like you know me at

2243
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:33,650
50 and well 49 whatever um and those of

2244
01:31:31,639 --> 01:31:36,650
us who have been doing this in the dark

2245
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:38,388
for so long we have been trying to you

2246
01:31:36,649 --> 01:31:41,149
know it's felt like Sisyphus right

2247
01:31:38,389 --> 01:31:42,829
trying to trying to push up doing this

2248
01:31:41,149 --> 01:31:44,929
you know the rock up the mountain that

2249
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:47,479
it just has it slide right back trying

2250
01:31:44,929 --> 01:31:52,100
to do this without the proper tools and

2251
01:31:47,479 --> 01:31:56,138
and in the dark so let's talk about

2252
01:31:52,100 --> 01:32:01,190
where to find more information on these

2253
01:31:56,139 --> 01:32:03,050
banker plants and trap plant solutions

2254
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:05,388
these protocols that you're talking

2255
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:08,570
about right so so if if they're really

2256
01:32:05,389 --> 01:32:14,150
unique to bioregion and they're unique

2257
01:32:08,569 --> 01:32:16,579
for you know particular species is there

2258
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:18,679
so for anybody who's going to give a

2259
01:32:16,579 --> 01:32:20,689
damn enough to do this extensive

2260
01:32:18,679 --> 01:32:22,789
research is there a good resource for

2261
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:24,888
them where they can learn about these

2262
01:32:22,789 --> 01:32:26,510
these programs like you're the athan

2263
01:32:24,889 --> 01:32:28,368
program you've been using as an example

2264
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:31,100
where they can learn what the other

2265
01:32:28,368 --> 01:32:32,689
programs are for different pests so they

2266
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:34,850
don't have to reinvent the wheel I'm

2267
01:32:32,689 --> 01:32:37,399
sure I know these programs exist but

2268
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:39,380
where do people learn about them well

2269
01:32:37,399 --> 01:32:41,500
unfortunately it's not much written and

2270
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:45,170
the problem is - it's a moving target

2271
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:47,719
because things change if you google like

2272
01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:49,850
pepper banker plants years ago we were

2273
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:52,189
using black pearl pepper and then some

2274
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:56,539
great research came out of Europe I

2275
01:32:52,189 --> 01:32:59,269
think Garba nestling did it where he

2276
01:32:56,539 --> 01:33:01,488
found that oh no wait a minute if you

2277
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:04,130
use purple flash pepper you can produce

2278
01:33:01,488 --> 01:33:06,589
way more aureus than black pearl

2279
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:08,118
so then everybody's like change okay now

2280
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:12,319
we're recommending this so if you go

2281
01:33:08,118 --> 01:33:14,238
back and read older stuff it may not be

2282
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:17,238
exactly accurate and so this is why it's

2283
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:20,868
a moving target of us working out in the

2284
01:33:17,238 --> 01:33:21,678
field and honestly the the people like

2285
01:33:20,868 --> 01:33:24,439
myself

2286
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:26,600
Ron Valentin who's with Bioware

2287
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:28,309
Kelly Vance with beneficial insectary

2288
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:30,829
who are working in this stuff every day

2289
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:32,630
honestly we're so busy doing it

2290
01:33:30,829 --> 01:33:35,988
unfortunately we're not writing about it

2291
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:38,630
and we're not you know we're not you

2292
01:33:35,988 --> 01:33:40,759
know you know T I mean none of us do

2293
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:42,500
blogs I mean occasionally we will spit

2294
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:44,480
out a magazine article here and there

2295
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:47,390
but that's what makes it difficult

2296
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:49,329
because most people just want to go to

2297
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:51,469
the Internet and do research on it today

2298
01:33:49,329 --> 01:33:52,579
we're if you want the most current

2299
01:33:51,469 --> 01:33:55,189
information you have to get to the

2300
01:33:52,579 --> 01:33:56,988
meetings where again people like myself

2301
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:58,819
or Ron where we're teaching workshops

2302
01:33:56,988 --> 01:34:02,079
because those are going to give you the

2303
01:33:58,819 --> 01:34:04,609
most what we know today because again

2304
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:08,600
recommendations I gave five 60 years ago

2305
01:34:04,609 --> 01:34:10,698
I know more now and they're not I that

2306
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:14,090
may not be accurate today for a

2307
01:34:10,698 --> 01:34:15,559
particular situation and so and that's

2308
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:17,060
one thing that frustrates me about the

2309
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:19,039
Internet is you put an article out there

2310
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:21,830
and it's there forever it doesn't go

2311
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:23,539
away and people then can get dated

2312
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:26,420
information so always when you're

2313
01:34:23,539 --> 01:34:29,180
looking at information look at the date

2314
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:31,010
on it and make sure you know is this

2315
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:32,690
still going to be relevant I mean basic

2316
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:36,110
biology yes that pretty much doesn't

2317
01:34:32,689 --> 01:34:39,259
change but you know we're smarter today

2318
01:34:36,109 --> 01:34:42,229
than we were five years ago on banker

2319
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:44,810
plans but you know for regionality on

2320
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:47,389
banker plants you know we're doing the

2321
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:49,789
same programs in greenhouses and you

2322
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:51,440
know west coast middle the united states

2323
01:34:49,789 --> 01:34:54,560
and east coast because there aren't that

2324
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:59,269
many developed programs what is more

2325
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:02,180
likely to change some what are the

2326
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:03,380
regionality of your pest pressures like

2327
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:06,170
this year actually it's been a pretty

2328
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:07,909
bad spider mite year where we haven't

2329
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:09,949
had big spider mite flare-ups and

2330
01:35:07,909 --> 01:35:11,389
greenhouses for several years because

2331
01:35:09,948 --> 01:35:14,899
the years before this it's been broad

2332
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:18,980
mites so we have you know yearly pests

2333
01:35:14,899 --> 01:35:21,379
as well as seasonal pests that you know

2334
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:26,659
make us alter our programs but there's

2335
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:30,770
not one good source nestle to go to now

2336
01:35:26,659 --> 01:35:32,510
on the aphid banker plant systems which

2337
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:35,480
i know people are interested in because

2338
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:38,000
they feed parasites can get expensive

2339
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:41,389
and again this program only work

2340
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:45,710
for a phidias coal money which again

2341
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:48,860
works for the green peach and cotton

2342
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:51,859
Melanie food and we'll we know it does

2343
01:35:48,859 --> 01:35:53,179
parasitize the cannabis aphid probably

2344
01:35:51,859 --> 01:35:58,969
the best place is to get information

2345
01:35:53,180 --> 01:36:03,050
from the producers of it not all in

2346
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:06,310
Sector EES support banker plant systems

2347
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:10,550
there's a pretty clean dividing line

2348
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:13,370
down down the line on who does and who

2349
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:15,440
doesn't I'll tell you beneficial insect

2350
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:19,159
area is a huge supporter of banker plant

2351
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:22,069
systems they sell them they work with

2352
01:36:19,159 --> 01:36:24,380
their growers with them you can also get

2353
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:27,500
them from SIA you can get banker plants

2354
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:29,750
also from Sierra biological in New York

2355
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:32,600
State and you're able to get information

2356
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:34,159
from them you also mentioned Ron

2357
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:37,280
Valentin before he's written several

2358
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:39,619
articles on banker plants but again

2359
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:42,109
watch the dates because things have

2360
01:36:39,619 --> 01:36:44,720
changed and I do believe he has some

2361
01:36:42,109 --> 01:36:47,539
literature that he's done for bio works

2362
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:50,630
on banker plants I am pretty sure they

2363
01:36:47,539 --> 01:36:52,010
have that up so those are places that

2364
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:53,810
you can get them so you're almost better

2365
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:56,270
off getting them from the actual

2366
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:58,100
companies that are out there doing and

2367
01:36:56,270 --> 01:37:00,860
working with it then necessarily

2368
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:04,250
googling and you know it's also kind of

2369
01:37:00,859 --> 01:37:06,229
like you know baking a cake back you

2370
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:08,270
know in 1900 your grandma made the best

2371
01:37:06,229 --> 01:37:09,439
cake and she'll give you the recipe but

2372
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:12,200
she's not going to give you that one

2373
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:14,449
special ingredient you know why would

2374
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:16,069
any of us put all our information out on

2375
01:37:14,449 --> 01:37:18,349
the internet and tell you exactly how to

2376
01:37:16,069 --> 01:37:20,420
do everything when you know I've got you

2377
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:22,970
know being a consultant I've got this

2378
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:24,649
problem with and the cannabis industry

2379
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:26,780
everybody else thinks they're a

2380
01:37:24,649 --> 01:37:28,039
consultant and people just want my

2381
01:37:26,779 --> 01:37:30,139
information that they can turn around

2382
01:37:28,039 --> 01:37:32,630
resell it's amazing to me how many

2383
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:35,360
consultants contacting me wanting me to

2384
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:36,829
solve problems for their customers that

2385
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:38,689
they're getting paid to do but they want

2386
01:37:36,829 --> 01:37:40,189
to get free information for me so

2387
01:37:38,689 --> 01:37:41,359
there's no way I would put all this

2388
01:37:40,189 --> 01:37:43,460
information out for free on the internet

2389
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:48,500
because somebody's going to snake it and

2390
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:49,819
sell it ok so to wrap this up this is

2391
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,829
going to be interesting because I

2392
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:55,039
normally try to

2393
01:37:51,829 --> 01:37:58,039
and my shows on a really nice up note

2394
01:37:55,039 --> 01:38:00,140
right but you know this the this our

2395
01:37:58,039 --> 01:38:03,289
conversation today has not gone at all

2396
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:06,050
as I planned I really thought that you

2397
01:38:03,289 --> 01:38:08,600
know we were going to talk about the you

2398
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:12,050
know the top five or six pests that

2399
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:14,450
cannabis folk are you know mostly coming

2400
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:17,119
into contact this year and we would talk

2401
01:38:14,449 --> 01:38:19,579
about our you know our best handful of

2402
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:21,409
trap and banker plants and you know

2403
01:38:19,579 --> 01:38:23,809
people should mix and match them in

2404
01:38:21,409 --> 01:38:27,590
their garden or something like that but

2405
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:32,230
actually um it's a lot messier than I

2406
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:34,730
thought it was not only the the

2407
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:39,139
identification the development of the

2408
01:38:34,729 --> 01:38:43,489
protocols the pre growing plants my god

2409
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:46,460
the the charging them in advance with

2410
01:38:43,489 --> 01:38:48,260
non pests benefit for the beneficials

2411
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:49,850
that I'd never considered that that

2412
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:52,579
sounds like a major pain in the ass and

2413
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:55,100
so what what I'm seeing here is that

2414
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:57,890
really for folks who want to go down

2415
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:58,340
this path to help decrease their pest

2416
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:02,390
pressure

2417
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:06,850
it's either a some graduate level

2418
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:09,740
research that hopefully you will do once

2419
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:12,890
significantly for your career grow where

2420
01:39:09,739 --> 01:39:15,109
you are and then you have to keep up on

2421
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:17,750
what comes out new every year but it's

2422
01:39:15,109 --> 01:39:20,269
you got this big up front research labor

2423
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:24,409
time and then to kind of like build out

2424
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:28,030
your program and or you have to go

2425
01:39:24,409 --> 01:39:31,789
really much more hardcore on prevention

2426
01:39:28,029 --> 01:39:34,219
so that you don't you know it takes you

2427
01:39:31,789 --> 01:39:35,239
don't really have to do banker and trap

2428
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,199
plants that's not we're going to put

2429
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:40,279
your emphasis you're going to put your

2430
01:39:36,199 --> 01:39:42,979
emphasis on on prevention but that is

2431
01:39:40,279 --> 01:39:45,439
not an inspiring finish to a show

2432
01:39:42,979 --> 01:39:47,269
Suzanne that is that is not a positive

2433
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:49,189
spin on and right this what what do you

2434
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:52,100
got for me Wow end this on a positive

2435
01:39:49,189 --> 01:39:54,439
note let me just give you this again I I

2436
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:56,750
I guess because I try to be so

2437
01:39:54,439 --> 01:39:59,239
detail-oriented maybe sometimes I

2438
01:39:56,750 --> 01:40:01,550
because I want people to be successful

2439
01:39:59,239 --> 01:40:04,279
and I just want people to be aware of

2440
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:05,570
what they're getting into and again if

2441
01:40:04,279 --> 01:40:07,429
you talk to

2442
01:40:05,569 --> 01:40:08,960
you know some my ornamental growers you

2443
01:40:07,429 --> 01:40:11,359
know it's kind of taking them a few

2444
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:13,189
years to really get their stride with

2445
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:16,698
their banker plant programs but once

2446
01:40:13,189 --> 01:40:20,059
they got them they got them and you know

2447
01:40:16,698 --> 01:40:23,178
that it it it works it is not for

2448
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:26,539
everybody I will stress that I mean I

2449
01:40:23,179 --> 01:40:28,039
think I said before I think maybe 5% of

2450
01:40:26,539 --> 01:40:30,078
ornamental growers are using banker

2451
01:40:28,039 --> 01:40:31,639
plants it's a very small amount it's

2452
01:40:30,078 --> 01:40:34,639
you've got to be the right kind of

2453
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:37,940
person to do this but that's set if you

2454
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:39,679
are dealing with aphids whether it be

2455
01:40:37,939 --> 01:40:42,169
again not all even species but if you're

2456
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:44,510
dealing with cotton melon or cannabis

2457
01:40:42,170 --> 01:40:49,219
e-fit and you're using a phidias coal

2458
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:51,889
money the simplest not cheapest the

2459
01:40:49,219 --> 01:40:56,539
simplest thing you could do is every two

2460
01:40:51,889 --> 01:40:58,639
weeks you can buy in the barley a food

2461
01:40:56,539 --> 01:41:01,368
bank or plant and what you do is you you

2462
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:04,159
get a clump of barley that's grown I

2463
01:41:01,368 --> 01:41:07,789
think it's grown in rock wall and it's

2464
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:10,219
covered in Athens and you just go set

2465
01:41:07,789 --> 01:41:12,319
that in your greenhouse you know you got

2466
01:41:10,219 --> 01:41:14,389
to put some water underneath it some

2467
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:16,880
people will plunk it into a pot and let

2468
01:41:14,389 --> 01:41:18,800
it grow and then as you release your

2469
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,020
parasites and they're flying around if

2470
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:24,349
they don't find enough if it's in your

2471
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:25,880
crop they'll go reproduce on that where

2472
01:41:24,349 --> 01:41:27,679
it gets more complicated is when people

2473
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:30,469
grow their own EFA's but people will do

2474
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:34,158
that for economic savings they buy one

2475
01:41:30,469 --> 01:41:36,020
even plant and then they'll you know in

2476
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:37,908
another part of the facility they'll

2477
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:39,889
just basically start a mini aphid farm

2478
01:41:37,908 --> 01:41:41,238
so instead of buying a plan every two

2479
01:41:39,889 --> 01:41:43,039
weeks they just take a plant out of

2480
01:41:41,238 --> 01:41:46,368
there a food farm and set it into their

2481
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:48,019
facility so the easy way to start would

2482
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:50,179
be just to buy a plant in every two

2483
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:52,820
weeks and just set it out it can be as

2484
01:41:50,179 --> 01:41:55,039
simple as that but you have to make sure

2485
01:41:52,819 --> 01:41:57,259
that if it is coal money is going to

2486
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:59,479
target the aphid you're dealing with and

2487
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:02,210
then that will help you build more

2488
01:41:59,479 --> 01:42:03,859
parasitoids in your facility so in the

2489
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:05,840
long run you can actually buy fewer

2490
01:42:03,859 --> 01:42:08,089
parasitoids paying for the cost of

2491
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,578
buying in the plants does that make it a

2492
01:42:08,090 --> 01:42:13,730
little more I chords and rainbows for

2493
01:42:10,578 --> 01:42:15,789
you probably not but but it is it is a

2494
01:42:13,729 --> 01:42:18,439
it is a good place to get started

2495
01:42:15,789 --> 01:42:21,469
because the the mountain

2496
01:42:18,439 --> 01:42:23,419
of research is high and for people who

2497
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:26,810
want to get started with something now

2498
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:29,149
that is a great low barrier to entry

2499
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:31,820
thing that they can start with white

2500
01:42:29,149 --> 01:42:34,849
that's for indoors now if you're outside

2501
01:42:31,819 --> 01:42:37,929
and actually I do a whole presentation

2502
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:39,949
on this on attracting native beneficials

2503
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:41,890
without having to go through everything

2504
01:42:39,948 --> 01:42:45,109
the simplest thing if you are outside

2505
01:42:41,890 --> 01:42:49,760
biodiversity that is what you need just

2506
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:52,279
plant biodiversity well that's that's

2507
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:55,280
nice and so now there is unicorn and

2508
01:42:52,279 --> 01:42:57,948
rainbows right grow outside and grow a

2509
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:59,809
whole bunch of variety of companion

2510
01:42:57,948 --> 01:43:01,519
plants all around them so you attract

2511
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:03,590
all the natural beneficials there you go

2512
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,690
well I would call them in Sector II plan

2513
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:08,000
sector equals I would call that's right

2514
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:09,198
classes and again depends on where you

2515
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,448
are because what you grow in South

2516
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:13,189
Florida is going to be what you know

2517
01:43:11,448 --> 01:43:16,519
different than growing in Yakima

2518
01:43:13,189 --> 01:43:19,159
Washington but what I've done for my

2519
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:21,170
vegetable garden is I have I first

2520
01:43:19,159 --> 01:43:22,760
planted all kinds of stuff out again you

2521
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:25,819
know calendula yarrow

2522
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:26,930
I tried gum free no lesser and then I

2523
01:43:25,819 --> 01:43:28,429
just look at the plant

2524
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:29,780
I'll go spend time and I'll just sit I

2525
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:32,480
have a little plastic stool and sit

2526
01:43:29,779 --> 01:43:35,750
there and watch who comes to visit it if

2527
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:38,059
I see things that I want coming around

2528
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:41,329
you know surf it flies to Canada flight

2529
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:43,430
that boom I'm going to plant more of

2530
01:43:41,329 --> 01:43:46,250
those when I did gum free no last year

2531
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:48,770
nothing ever visited the gum free no gum

2532
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:51,529
FreeNAS out and that's how from my yard

2533
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:53,570
I've selected what plans if you're in

2534
01:43:51,529 --> 01:43:59,139
the Northeast Corridor growing outdoors

2535
01:43:53,569 --> 01:44:02,000
/ depends date did an amazing project in

2536
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:03,440
2005 where they roped in all these

2537
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,930
master gardeners and they give them

2538
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:08,000
little stools and they sat at plants and

2539
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:09,949
then they measured the number of

2540
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,719
pollinators visiting the number of

2541
01:44:09,948 --> 01:44:13,129
surface fly visiting the number of

2542
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:16,310
butterflies visiting and then they

2543
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:18,170
listed them out and so you know for me I

2544
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:20,840
want you know all the pollinator and

2545
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:24,140
sand fly plants and so I've pulled from

2546
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:25,670
that list a plant in my yard and you

2547
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:27,560
know that generally these plants aren't

2548
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:30,230
the plants you're going to go find down

2549
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:32,060
at your garden center because again the

2550
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:35,119
garden center stuff has been

2551
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:36,620
said for what humans want not with the

2552
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:39,229
insects once so I've been you know

2553
01:44:36,619 --> 01:44:42,890
digging deep sin to the bowels of buying

2554
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:46,669
weirdo seeds and you know Pig nan themes

2555
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:49,250
the the mountain mints are phenomenal

2556
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:51,710
for pollinators and toucan it flies and

2557
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:53,600
toucan it flies you go Google toucan

2558
01:44:51,710 --> 01:44:56,409
applies to learn about them but toucan

2559
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:59,210
defies our amazing you want them around

2560
01:44:56,409 --> 01:45:01,159
and so by doing things like that is how

2561
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:03,439
you can select plants that do well in

2562
01:45:01,159 --> 01:45:05,599
your area and if you grow one plant one

2563
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:07,279
year and it's like covered in aphids

2564
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,620
like maybe we shouldn't grow that one

2565
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:11,599
this year but if you grow like milkweed

2566
01:45:09,619 --> 01:45:13,609
and it gets covered with milkweed aphids

2567
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:16,480
those aren't going to move into your

2568
01:45:13,609 --> 01:45:20,059
cannabis and those will provide food

2569
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:23,299
resources for Lady Bird Beatles and

2570
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:28,210
surf'n'fries' and lace wings so that has

2571
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:29,570
now turned into a banker plant in itself

2572
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:33,859
Wow

2573
01:45:29,569 --> 01:45:36,170
I like that too because it creates a

2574
01:45:33,859 --> 01:45:39,649
sense of momentum you know in the cult

2575
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:41,180
in the cultivation area right instead of

2576
01:45:39,649 --> 01:45:43,429
there necessarily being happening to be

2577
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:45,710
all this research upfront these are some

2578
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:48,250
actions that you can do now while you're

2579
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:51,109
ill boning up on the rest of the science

2580
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:52,729
yes and and and this is what I'll do all

2581
01:45:51,109 --> 01:45:54,409
look at stuff and then all go to

2582
01:45:52,729 --> 01:45:56,389
universe and say hey this is what I'm

2583
01:45:54,409 --> 01:45:59,269
seeing can we work on something but

2584
01:45:56,390 --> 01:46:02,570
understand that these research projects

2585
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:05,510
takes years for them to happen and it

2586
01:46:02,569 --> 01:46:06,799
takes money and time and that's why we

2587
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:08,659
don't get a lot of the kind of this

2588
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:11,659
research because nobody's willing to pay

2589
01:46:08,659 --> 01:46:14,090
for this kind of research well hopefully

2590
01:46:11,659 --> 01:46:15,859
that stuff will come along soon Suzanne

2591
