1
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,370
so so the reason why I wanted to come

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,980
over and talk to you today Patrick is

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,779
that I got turned on to your product

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,890
actually it's right here the happy

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:22,079
endings tea mix when I was visiting

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,839
Wonderland nursery just Southie here in

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,059
humble and it was Kevin chaudhary who

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,948
told me about it and and he had one of

9
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,349
your big you know 55-gallon drums or

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,179
whatever and and um and he was all

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,489
excited that I had just gotten delivered

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,159
and I'm all like alright well if if

13
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,468
Kevin Jodrey is a inspiration to me and

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,250
I and I you know I take his advices

15
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,410
being really high-quality and he's all

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,679
excited because he's got a new 55-gallon

17
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:52,049
drum of your product I'm all like what

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,969
the hell is this product right and so um

19
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,569
so I got a guy I got up in just a few

20
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,308
bags in there right and um and I I can

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,698
admit I don't have a lot of experience

22
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:05,189
with compost tea but I had some and then

23
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,560
and then I used yours and it did it did

24
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,200
two things that I had never really come

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,260
across before number one the stuff

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,560
phoned an amazing amount like two it was

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,880
a common out of mine my buckets and and

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm gonna ask you about the foam in a

29
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,949
moment but my response was if if I think

30
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,259
I'm looking for a foam and this has got

31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,820
a ton of foam maybe that's some kind of

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,579
benchmark of good right so I'm like

33
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,859
alright I like that but the real test

34
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,798
was when I started pouring it on my

35
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,019
plants I was feeding you know once to

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,799
you know once and a half one or two

37
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,929
times a week with it straight at 100%

38
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:46,560
but then I was also diluting it down to

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:50,310
like 30% and using it foliar and and it

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:55,530
took under a week for everybody to perk

41
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,180
back up the colors to darken and and you

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,829
know when when the plants that are

43
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,149
really good mood and sunshine the leaves

44
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,029
come up and they like look all praying

45
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,849
right everybody's everybody's praying or

46
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,399
saluting I like that too so so I you

47
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:11,819
know I was like what what is this stuff

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,979
right magic it's magic right and so so I

49
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,199
started so so so so then I started like

50
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,149
I kind of sort of

51
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,759
you down and we cross paths a couple

52
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,590
times and so now I'm to the point now

53
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,669
that I'm recommending this to people

54
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,200
awesome and and and I'm realizing that

55
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:30,018
it would be good for everybody if I

56
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,000
stopped by here at your lab and asked

57
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:35,060
you something the the general questions

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,818
that everybody asks me so that instead

59
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,340
of me trying to do it myself every time

60
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:42,919
I could just like sending them the link

61
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,239
right so so so the first couple

62
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,518
questions I have for you are gonna be

63
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,289
real basic stuff okay and then and then

64
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,060
I've got a couple that for the people

65
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:51,739
who already know about compost tea and

66
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,810
are interested in know more and then

67
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,189
we'll be done so okay so let's let's

68
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,430
start at the very basics you know a lot

69
00:02:55,189 --> 00:03:00,979
of people especially the indoor scene

70
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,810
folks have been trained to use you know

71
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:05,119
bottled nutrients some of them

72
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,390
synthetics some of them high in salts

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,599
and and you know they all have different

74
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:14,568
roles but you know the natural the

75
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,909
organic the healthier compost folks all

76
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:19,159
of them come back to you know you can

77
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:21,949
dump almost all of that stuff and just

78
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,079
go with compost tea but honestly a lot

79
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:27,858
of people are like aren't I no compost

80
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:30,650
tea this is good I don't know why so so

81
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:33,290
what what is it about compost tea that

82
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,810
makes it so great for both your cannabis

83
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:37,939
plants and like also your food and

84
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,439
ornamental plants at home tall plants

85
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,930
it's it's actually an amazing thing that

86
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,239
there's a lot of research going on right

87
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,849
now but um basically what we're looking

88
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,099
at is in nature's way of feeding plants

89
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,780
is done through a biological system in

90
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,060
the soil between the roots and the soil

91
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,549
with they call it the mycorrhizae system

92
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,090
as a general term which involves the

93
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:00,920
roots bacteria fungus different

94
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,229
different little animals in the soil and

95
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,629
basically a compost tea is is your is

96
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:07,789
your making an incubator for those those

97
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:11,539
beneficial organisms that help feed your

98
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:16,488
plants so um a compost tea brewer is a

99
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:18,108
water air and and your initial starting

100
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,288
whatever you're starting with bacteria

101
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,560
there were either from worm castings or

102
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:24,319
powdered mycorrhizae that you can

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,870
that they've cultivated in farms

104
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,730
Kakashi's another good starting point

105
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,199
root balls from local healthy soils

106
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,450
another good starting point

107
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,819
but basically the idea of a compost tea

108
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:38,819
is your is your incubating the

109
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,310
beneficial bacteria and feeding them

110
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:43,168
back in your plants you know million

111
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,540
fold a billion fold so you're just

112
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:48,109
boosting that natural system up into

113
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,389
overdrive now one thing you have to be

114
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,400
weary of is that the tea brewer is an

115
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,840
incubator so you have to be careful of

116
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,039
what you know what you put in is going

117
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,168
to multiply under the right

118
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,080
circumstances so you want to stay away

119
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:03,629
from fresh guano's for e.coli because

120
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,819
then you can actually poison what

121
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,589
situation a biohazard and I've heard

122
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,599
tales of a few people getting sick over

123
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,339
it but basically you're gonna incubate

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,260
them but your product doesn't have any I

125
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,789
wanna know so I don't know if you're

126
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,279
gonna use gorals what you can if you

127
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,900
want a more of a fertilizer tea is I

128
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,019
suggest you Adam after the brewing

129
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:23,399
process so there's not a chance for the

130
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:25,740
multiplication to happen but that's

131
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:28,288
basically compost teas in a nutshell and

132
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,050
they are an amazing there are many ways

133
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:32,909
to brew them and they do benefit almost

134
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,579
every plan I've ever put them put on

135
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:39,150
them yeah citrus growers in Florida are

136
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:41,639
big on it so um it just boosts that

137
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:44,339
natural biology in the soil right on so

138
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,259
you're taking you're taking a like a

139
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,569
living soil environment where you would

140
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:52,349
normally have these healthy microbes and

141
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:55,199
by by brewing a compost tea and and

142
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,710
adding it you're creating this like like

143
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,050
biotic soil where where everything's so

144
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:02,579
much more thriving and do I understand

145
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,680
it correctly that that you know

146
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:08,009
generally speaking what's happening is

147
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,639
this did this microbe community that

148
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:13,709
you're feeding which is is is in the

149
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,168
rhizosphere right which is the area

150
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:20,159
around the roots it essentially makes a

151
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:22,370
buffet in the soil so whatever your

152
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,039
plant whether it be cannabis or whatever

153
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:28,649
all of the inputs that the plant wants

154
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:30,149
are there at its beck and call so it

155
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:32,038
doesn't have to struggle to get them

156
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,399
they're all there no that's a big

157
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,289
misconception is

158
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,870
we have to add phosphorus when it's

159
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,490
flowering but in nature if you think

160
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,769
about it a fruit tree doesn't go to

161
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,228
another area one that needs nitrogen or

162
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,849
it needs phosphorus yeah hey if it's

163
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:47,349
there it takes the one that needs it and

164
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,449
some of the research that's done is

165
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,490
there's a little receptors that actually

166
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,079
leave the root to look for what they

167
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:57,879
need so there'll be a receptor for

168
00:06:53,079 --> 00:07:00,038
nitrogen or phosphate or potassium so so

169
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,189
yeah if if you build a real healthy soil

170
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:05,139
you know it takes things when they when

171
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,728
they need it the salt based nutrients

172
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,769
are charged particles and when you put

173
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:12,159
them in water so that's basically the

174
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:14,349
mechanism to go into the room nothing

175
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,030
will move in nature unless unless it's

176
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,129
being pushed or pulled and it's either

177
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,879
gravity pulling it down or plus and

178
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,038
minus charges

179
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,250
that's the nuts and so salts are really

180
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,719
a delicate thing because they're kind of

181
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,910
force-fed it's kind of like shoving an

182
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,849
IV into the root it has the root has no

183
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,320
control of any it's kind like force-feed

184
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:34,899
it actually moves a much life force

185
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,639
feeding so so there is a place for salts

186
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:39,339
in nature they're a good transport agent

187
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,639
but um it's kind of I look at it like a

188
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:44,739
meal you know we we eat things that used

189
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,629
to be alive every culture in the world

190
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,310
eats things that used to be alive

191
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,319
because it has all the elements of life

192
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,569
and things that used to be living but

193
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,519
adding a little bit of salt our spice is

194
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,649
really important for that meal to to

195
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,389
taste better and I look at a lot that

196
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:00,879
way in nature you know there's some good

197
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,189
natural salts to use I've never use a

198
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,228
synthetic salt but Epsom salt is one

199
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:09,098
natural salt it's real good magnesium

200
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:11,829
source so um yeah carbon based nutrients

201
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:14,168
are kind of the key and for a while yeah

202
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:16,418
the industry was real big on salts but

203
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:19,538
again they're tricky to use and they can

204
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:21,250
burn plants and you know and this is not

205
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:23,740
good at as good as organic you know a

206
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:28,389
Miracle Grow to tomatoes not as good as

207
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:30,009
a chicken corn or chicken food tomatoes

208
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,930
well I know that when I my parents

209
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,968
generation you know everybody was in

210
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,070
love with like chemistry and technology

211
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:39,580
and science was gonna solve everything

212
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,099
right and and and sometimes you go down

213
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,060
that path enough and you realize okay

214
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,040
actually if we come all the way back to

215
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,919
how nature does stuff itself we're

216
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,769
actually gonna get

217
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,149
better results and absolutely you know

218
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:52,759
where the salts originally came from

219
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,679
they were left over bomb-making material

220
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,179
from World War two oh and so the

221
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,620
nitrates are variant so they were trying

222
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:00,588
to figure out ways to use and it turns

223
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,899
out plants yeah it was like you know

224
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:04,760
putting plants on steroids but they also

225
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,129
point in the soil they poison the water

226
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:10,250
supply so there's a lot of downsides

227
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:12,230
that the salt chemicals a funny side

228
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,320
note I was actually once stopped at an

229
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,329
airport and my TSA because I had not

230
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,440
yours but somebody else's compost tea

231
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:21,289
packets that I had gotten in a

232
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,660
convention as samples and and as soon as

233
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:25,698
they read fertilizer they won't they ran

234
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:27,528
all the bomb tests on them and I'm like

235
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:30,049
I'm like really dude I'm just organic

236
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:32,028
you know like but that was funny so

237
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:35,919
ammonium nitrate is but is that one oh

238
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:40,100
well it triggered the supervisor agent

239
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:42,708
so um so yeah alright so a compost tea

240
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,509
brewer when I first learned about that

241
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,578
I'm like oh my god I need to get this so

242
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,559
I can some kind of piece of technology

243
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:50,778
to be able to brew this and it wasn't

244
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,679
until I actually watched some of your

245
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:57,019
videos online that I realized that a

246
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,609
compost tea brewer is not really like

247
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:00,470
some kind of sensational piece of

248
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,949
technology that's difficult it's

249
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:06,490
essentially oh and I also realized so

250
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:09,828
you need that you need to feed you know

251
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,079
oxygen into it and and I tried it with

252
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:14,149
just a simple aquarium bubbler which

253
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,309
doesn't have enough right you need a lot

254
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:19,070
of air so you need it you need a pretty

255
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:21,528
good size you know still only like 20

256
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,800
bucks but yeah you do you need a decent

257
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:29,179
size air pump and and and it's gonna be

258
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:32,120
bubbling into a 5-gallon bucket they can

259
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:36,289
get in any hardware store and and you

260
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:39,828
put in water um and then and then you

261
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:43,009
put in the product and then it just goes

262
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:44,778
so it sounds like it's a piece of gear

263
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,039
but it's it's not really through it yeah

264
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,539
it's basically you're setting up you

265
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,879
need a water supply you need a vessel

266
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:52,519
for the water and in the tea that you

267
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,828
put in and a good air a good air source

268
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,169
there's different methods of circulating

269
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:59,028
the water or air stones are real

270
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:01,189
simple and cheap you can get started for

271
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:02,838
you want a really good air pump as is as

272
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,600
much as you can afford you can't go too

273
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,940
big of air so I'm an air pump a good

274
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,759
clean air stone some clean water you

275
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,490
want to stay away the chlorine is is in

276
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,799
in municipal water to keep the

277
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,430
biologicals activity from happening so

278
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:21,289
the less chlorine the better and whether

279
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,120
you're on a well or you can dechlorinate

280
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:24,559
your water in different ways you can

281
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,078
also collect rainwater which is high oh

282
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,149
that that's a great place three modern

283
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:32,359
lake water will all brew some amazing

284
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:34,490
teas so the water is important the water

285
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,899
the air and the temperature are kind of

286
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:39,110
main variables that you're dealing with

287
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,970
and as far as the inputs are an infinite

288
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,839
of a variety of inputs but if you're

289
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,430
using good healthy organisms that break

290
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,560
down soil like what's naturally in a

291
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:50,539
compost what's naturally in the belly of

292
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,049
a worm so the worm castings have all

293
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:55,429
that natural or you know biological

294
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:58,189
activity so what we're going to do is

295
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,588
multiply those and that's the basic idea

296
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,420
of a tea and it just turns out it works

297
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,699
really well and yet you also have to

298
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:06,799
feed do we didn't talk a whole lot about

299
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:09,708
that you need in order for something to

300
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:13,338
live it needs food water a place to live

301
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:16,429
and an oxygen so that's what we're

302
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:18,620
providing the simplest form of food is a

303
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:20,870
sugar because that's what the simplest

304
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,448
form of food is and all all life loves

305
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,909
sugar so you can use molasses or or any

306
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:28,578
kind of good sugar you can also use

307
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:30,649
starches you know fish have a lot of

308
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:32,088
nutrients and sugar but it takes a

309
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,559
little longer to brew them because you

310
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,209
got to break down those starches into

311
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,009
simple sugars with your product that you

312
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,448
have to add molasses everything's in

313
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:40,220
there we have aa nice powder and

314
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:42,139
molasses source that's not real strong

315
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,930
it's like the bark there's someone's

316
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:46,879
kind of flaky but um turned out yeah it

317
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,349
feeds them really nicely and that's

318
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,000
honestly one of the things that I liked

319
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,600
about your product because you know I'm

320
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,828
busy doing everything else and sometimes

321
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,839
I'll read online that people have got

322
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:58,969
these complex recipes and all these

323
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,500
things I need to buy and really I need

324
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,129
this to be kind of like a set it and

325
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,839
forget it

326
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,649
things thing that's what I needed to

327
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,089
yeah right so I just take the

328
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,889
hey you know or whatnot the whole bag

329
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:10,170
but I scooped out what I need for my

330
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:12,028
five gallon bucket and I put in my air

331
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,740
and I'm done right it's not like I need

332
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:15,389
to make you know also go get the

333
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,089
molasses and all that kind of stuff so I

334
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:20,249
like the kind of one-stop shopping knob

335
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,050
of it it's a great starter it has

336
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:24,209
everything you need but again if you can

337
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:26,849
add some local biology like if you can

338
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:28,558
go out to a local soil that's healthy

339
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,019
and add some of those root masses into

340
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,578
that or your worm castings or compost

341
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,049
that's all beneficial you're all just

342
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,328
going to you're going to add it in

343
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:41,490
there's plenty inside this like all the

344
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:43,678
meals the fishbone of in the crab they

345
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,240
all covered in bacteria so it once you

346
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:46,438
put it in the water it activates and it

347
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,600
all starts breaking down so there's

348
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:51,058
plenty of bacteria in the tea mix but it

349
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,339
never hurts add some more that's local

350
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:55,019
one of my buddies who uses your stuff

351
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,279
and I was funny because I always thought

352
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,539
his plans were good but I didn't know he

353
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,970
uses you used your stuff until

354
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:02,490
afterwards he actually also takes um

355
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,040
just like grasses from this yard and

356
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:10,079
just Chuck's on in there and he started

357
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:11,879
doing that for just simple like fpj is

358
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,469
like like fermented plant juices and

359
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:15,688
he's like well I'll put it in my compost

360
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:19,050
tea too and and and and all of those

361
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:22,889
grasses are filled with our cupboard by

362
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:24,870
local yeah microbes you know that things

363
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:27,629
like a place to live um I have I have

364
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,789
diam acacia Cerf MIT which is a lot of

365
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:32,399
surface area molecule so that's a real

366
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:34,740
nice house form but you once some people

367
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,259
throw in hey just have them some surface

368
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,610
area that they can grab on to or so

369
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,318
they're not just floating around they're

370
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,678
like holding on and I think it's easier

371
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:45,479
for a lot of animals to have a place to

372
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:47,039
ground London I like that you said they

373
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,360
need a home I like that that makes a lot

374
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,178
of sense you know it's like this

375
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,149
universal yeah something to anchor on

376
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:55,889
Jim yeah all right so so now the part I

377
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:58,649
was really interested in the foam part

378
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:01,350
right cuz like I have I feel before I

379
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:03,659
became a little more dedicated to your

380
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,159
product I tried some some other stuff

381
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,838
and you know since I'm in the industry

382
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,698
people are constantly giving these stuff

383
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,309
to trial and I try everything because I

384
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,879
want to stay educated well some of the

385
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:15,399
stuff doesn't foam very much

386
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,230
right and you know yeah email their

387
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,939
customer service knowing you know it's

388
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,100
fine it's a good product but her but

389
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,160
then I used your stuff and it just like

390
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,440
it it really foam as well and I'm not an

391
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,579
you know if somebody's thinking about

392
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,140
using it you're like oh my gosh I don't

393
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,750
wanna make a mess it's not like it's

394
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,429
always it's not like it's like that kind

395
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,480
of a mess but if you've got a

396
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:37,149
five-gallon bucket

397
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,330
sometimes it'll foam up an inch but the

398
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:42,419
foam is thick and it so stands up and so

399
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,700
it's not making a mess but uh but

400
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:48,099
intuitively I want to think that some

401
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,900
alive stuff right because it's making

402
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,240
the phone and I don't know if that's

403
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,860
true or not so what makes the whole that

404
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,669
that's how I look you know we're we're

405
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:00,519
you're multiplying living organisms

406
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:02,379
living organisms produce co2 so once

407
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,529
they can only turn oxygen and sugar into

408
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:08,169
co2 so um to me the foam is an

409
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:10,120
indication of the biological activity in

410
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:11,949
the tea when you start off there's very

411
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,690
little and then will go through a growth

412
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,420
cycle and you have to kind of figure out

413
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:18,310
due to your temperature water conditions

414
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:19,949
how much minerals in your water chlorine

415
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,059
in your water how much air flow

416
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,710
determines the length of the brew time

417
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:25,809
and you can actually I think it's a

418
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,100
great indication of where you're at in

419
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:29,409
the tea cycle because you're going to

420
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,450
the population is going to increase and

421
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:33,490
explode and then it'll start eating

422
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,129
itself and the food's gone and the

423
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,480
poisons are in the we know the their

424
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,039
excrements are in the water so it

425
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,250
actually poisons them and then they will

426
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:45,969
die off so the level of foam increases

427
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:48,279
as how I look at it in created sio2 foam

428
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,470
is what it is at co2 bubbles so that's

429
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,509
coming from the living it and it will go

430
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,950
to a maximum and then die off it's

431
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:59,200
usually anywhere from two to five days

432
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,780
typically it's two days so if it's co2 I

433
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,328
would say that it's pretty fair to say

434
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:06,639
that it's in there their exhalation well

435
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:08,049
I mean it might be their excretion - but

436
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,089
one way or another it's their it's their

437
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,980
waste pot it's respiration and it is

438
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:14,708
right for animals breathe in oxygen and

439
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,809
mix it with water than in sugar and

440
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,029
you're buying me breathe out co2 that's

441
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:20,859
what we do so that's it that is a good

442
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:22,539
indication of the biological octave and

443
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,029
then not only that the smell I'm big on

444
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,829
sweet fresh

445
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:27,569
he smells and I like the tea one has a

446
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,449
little bit of ocean spill because I have

447
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,740
some fish in there but um sweet and

448
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,890
earthy and then once it will die off

449
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,630
that will sour a bit and yeah I'm not

450
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,400
big on using at that point I think some

451
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:44,310
people do but at that point I like just

452
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:47,280
to toss it in the compost pile so so

453
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:49,619
alright so so so I brew my tea you know

454
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,950
I've got I've made my little my bubbler

455
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:55,709
my five gallon and I and I put my dose

456
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,950
of powder in there and and it foams up

457
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,630
and I've reached my like like apex of

458
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,080
foam right so I know everything is the

459
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,670
most alive and and you know feel free to

460
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:10,009
tell me if I'm wrong but at that point

461
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:12,240
um I will you know take out the air and

462
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:14,970
and I will use it in one of two ways

463
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,430
either I will walk out to my garden and

464
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,890
I've got a you know I got a smaller

465
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,529
bucket and I'll just like to it

466
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,230
and a hundred percent and um I'll just

467
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:28,049
put like put a little bit in you know

468
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,539
whatever how much I can spread it out

469
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:32,460
right I'll put a dose if you will and in

470
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:36,149
everybody near near where the stem is

471
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,769
hitting the soil and then and then and

472
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,480
then I just generally believe that I

473
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:41,339
should finish it with a little bit of

474
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,599
fresh water so it gets down more towards

475
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,609
the roots now that how you doing

476
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:46,259
absolutely you can also you can dilute

477
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:47,639
it before you do that but it's a little

478
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:50,369
more work you know carrying it around

479
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,020
but hand watering is really nice there's

480
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:53,699
always gonna be a biofilm that you know

481
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:55,619
some people like to pump it with drip

482
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,660
lines because some of these they use it

483
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,389
on big farms and the irrigation lines

484
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,660
will get a biofilm inside and water

485
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,759
logging in right yeah yeah so so hand

486
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,320
watering is labor-intensive but it's

487
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,269
probably the best way and I use it

488
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,879
absolutely fresh because you can't

489
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:13,740
bottle a living you know it dies in a

490
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,630
bottle right they living things shelf

491
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,519
life would be like 72 hours it's not

492
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,960
that long no it's not even that I don't

493
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,450
know how long it is but some there are

494
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,460
some bottle teas but they think they

495
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,740
can't be as good as a real fresh right

496
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,840
out you want the maximum numbers so it's

497
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,700
like brew it and you

498
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,769
and in the in the viola the good thing

499
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,889
about the biological activity is for the

500
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:36,259
file the by organisms is they they're

501
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:38,298
not really given um PK or any nutrients

502
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,909
they're just facilitating the transfer

503
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:43,398
of a nutrients from the soil so there's

504
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:45,169
no real burning involved you can't you

505
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:47,178
can dilute it I'll you know some people

506
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,120
dilute it ten to one some people use it

507
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:52,460
pure you know as a test I like to

508
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,709
maximize you know push things that limit

509
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,659
so I've used pure key without any

510
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,569
dilution on every watering throughout a

511
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:01,429
cycle and it is fine I mean things are a

512
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:03,589
little bit too nitrogen II they're low a

513
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,929
little dark green but everything is very

514
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:09,079
healthy and well and for people whose

515
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:11,899
plants don't look robust and dark green

516
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:13,819
like it's better to be on that side then

517
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:16,398
the kind of emaciated and kind of

518
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:18,700
yellowing kind of things like the

519
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:21,168
compost tea just makes them you know

520
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,700
camouflage green like serious in what

521
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:24,679
you meant about foliar feeding that

522
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,149
that's another thing it's very there's a

523
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,009
lot of the good things going on there

524
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:30,439
but again everything in nature is

525
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:32,179
looking for somewhere to live and in

526
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,850
colonize so when you when you add

527
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:39,320
compost tea to the foyer what happens is

528
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:42,349
a lot of those microorganisms populate

529
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,210
the leaf and so when another mold comes

530
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:46,158
along or a mite or something that's

531
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,379
actually physically taken up they have

532
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,629
to have to move on so so having that

533
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:52,699
high biodiversity to your planet so you

534
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:55,158
can't see it but it does colonize on

535
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,590
your plant it's it's a nice that's a

536
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,850
nice nice natural way for protecting

537
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,618
your plant from a lot of other

538
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:03,199
microorganisms so you're filling that

539
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:05,808
vacuum exactly where like a spider mite

540
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,740
or a powdery mildew or a future boat

541
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:10,759
Rytas would would become an opportunist

542
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,288
and jump in there

543
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:13,999
you're like knitting in it we're already

544
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:15,319
gonna fill it with these healthy

545
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:17,118
microbes so there's already somebody

546
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,950
live in there exactly yeah so many years

547
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:21,558
an indoor you try to you know everything

548
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,288
so clean it's just a real nice place for

549
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:26,210
a predator to come in or something bad

550
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:28,730
and take over that's why indoor growers

551
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,038
can have real problems do there is no

552
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,868
biodiversity you know in the morning

553
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:33,680
biodiversity he'll have the better I

554
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:37,309
mean I'm real

555
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,380
so so i I've sprayed it fully or just a

556
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:42,019
handful of times I'm still experimenting

557
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,580
with it and um actually the first time I

558
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:46,009
did it I sprayed it at a hundred percent

559
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:47,179
and I came back the next day a little

560
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:48,829
freaked out because I thought I had

561
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,080
gotten some kind of purple powdery

562
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:52,730
mildew and it wasn't that at all it was

563
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,519
just as some of the droplets had dried

564
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,170
with the compost and so you know I just

565
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,569
sprayed everything off and learned from

566
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,860
it right but but but since you you do

567
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:05,720
use it all the time what percentage of

568
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:07,579
compost tea to fresh water do you

569
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,100
recommend for foliar you know that's

570
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:11,659
that's a good and spraying - if you have

571
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:13,099
a really fine mist there are some of

572
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,290
those little animals are getting kind of

573
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:17,899
big so when those when you get put in

574
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:19,250
those little micro bursts it actually

575
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,650
shouldn't can shred them up and kill

576
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,150
himself you definitely don't want to

577
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,660
have it on a high mess when you're doing

578
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,280
it I actually like to UM like when

579
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,230
they're small I dip them completely

580
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:32,000
upside down until a fresh batch of teeth

581
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,460
that you dipped up you do there's a plan

582
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,680
to get the entire thing like a flea dip

583
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:40,279
or something but just cut completely

584
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,230
coat the plant and then yeah just and

585
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,700
also the tea can have some residue in it

586
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,930
so you know you want to be even might

587
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,900
want to strain it if you're going to

588
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,670
spray it but yeah there's form a scale

589
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,740
based prayers are fine they just don't

590
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:54,320
have it a real fine mist and your baby

591
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,180
should be okay it's okay just do it

592
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,549
before it's flowering there's probably

593
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,350
good ideas so you know we've already

594
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:02,629
kind of established that you can't

595
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:04,639
really do it too much right like if

596
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,550
anything your plant might become like

597
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,170
you know very dark green and in many

598
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:12,319
cases that's that's better than the

599
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:16,700
opposite side but if somebody wanted to

600
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:18,769
do in an optimized amount where they are

601
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,559
they're benefiting the plant as much as

602
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:23,029
they can but they're also not overdoing

603
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,379
it because they you know a lot of

604
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:27,740
especially patients right they're on

605
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,020
budgets and they want to be able to use

606
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,859
it but not too much so what would you

607
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:37,129
recommend as a as a good regular feeding

608
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:39,679
regime typically what I do is I always

609
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,690
like when I transplant like to water and

610
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,240
tea to just to set that biological

611
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,970
activity upfront I'm a little lazy so I

612
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,150
don't bruise

613
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,069
often I might hit them three times four

614
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,140
times and you can actually water the day

615
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:53,908
before you harvest it's not you know

616
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,770
this it's fine

617
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:57,720
but um you can use it to the very end

618
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:00,179
into the very beginning clones all the

619
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,589
way to to the very end you know last

620
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,298
days of flowering

621
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:04,589
I usually hit them two or three times

622
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:06,210
but I always like to hit them at first

623
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:07,500
you know once they're transplanted just

624
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,960
to set up that buy a lot extra

625
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,519
biological activity and then you know

626
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,429
and another thing I think is kind of

627
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,480
important for psychoactive plants I

628
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:19,530
think there needs to be a little bit of

629
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,419
stress involved you know look don't over

630
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,918
water your plants I guess is be they let

631
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,870
it if you're going to err err on the

632
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,759
side will let them droop a tiny bit

633
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:28,288
instead of over water and you keep the

634
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,759
roots wet so because your roots are real

635
00:24:28,288 --> 00:24:31,440
important to keep healthy that that's

636
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,450
that's the beginning that's you know

637
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,919
that's the main or that everything gets

638
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,569
absorbed so you want a lot of surface

639
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,130
area in your reach that's that's one

640
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:40,109
thing about the tea I have something I

641
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,090
have to say have some biological I can't

642
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:44,250
we just strip the roots of that old

643
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:46,079
brown scale so you should have nice

644
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,029
light fluffy roots so that was kind of

645
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,369
engineered into the tea which I think

646
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:52,529
kind of makes it a little bit makes it

647
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:55,048
work really well is the number of

648
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:56,428
ingredients I used to make healthy roots

649
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:58,859
because that's what that's where it

650
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:01,500
starts so don't over water the plant so

651
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:03,149
but yeah two or three waterings of fresh

652
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,819
water and a tea water you should be fine

653
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:08,700
so so to kind of unpack that a little

654
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:12,149
bit you're suggesting that at the

655
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,620
beginning at transplant maybe hit it you

656
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,179
know you know two or three times in a

657
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,759
row because you're building up the

658
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:20,250
community but after that like maybe

659
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,230
every third or fourth I said it was just

660
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,159
the first watering that when I trance so

661
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,250
you don't use it throughout the whole

662
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,780
cycle no well I do but I do use it maybe

663
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,880
once when I first walked and then I

664
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,710
might do three weeks old break our water

665
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,870
and then hit him with tea again when

666
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,220
they when they transition from

667
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:36,389
vegetation of flower it's a good time to

668
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,890
hit them because they need they need a

669
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,520
bunch of nutrients at that's all so are

670
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,750
you suggesting that that once hmm

671
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,339
so it's starting to think I'm trying to

672
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,470
think about it more like an inoculant at

673
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:48,928
this absolutely asleep it's an amazing

674
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,808
enough so I'm putting it in and I don't

675
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:54,028
necessarily have to do it again every

676
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:56,038
week because they're they're they live

677
00:25:54,028 --> 00:25:59,159
as long as you have a nice healthy soil

678
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,778
and another another issue if you've used

679
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,429
salts in your cell before like another

680
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:04,528
one of those bug boosters called

681
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:06,778
monopotassium phosphate it's in all the

682
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:09,298
big numbers yeah for bloom boosters that

683
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:11,009
actually can just damage your soil and

684
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:13,138
keep things from living and actually

685
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:15,089
lock out sort of nutrients so if you

686
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:17,878
have a good living soil starting off

687
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:20,308
with yeah I did yeah you don't have to

688
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:22,199
keep the sole the plant feeds itself

689
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:24,569
from the soil you just want a real

690
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,609
healthy soil and that's what ocean belly

691
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:29,278
does it makes it a real wide spectrum of

692
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:30,538
them super so right on

693
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,579
alright so I've got I got one more

694
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:35,759
questions before we talk about how folks

695
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:37,829
can get it right so so you know I talk

696
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,659
to a lot of folks especially when I met

697
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:42,718
conventions right and they're all like

698
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,070
you know we're doing 50 acres you know

699
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:46,349
and as soon as they say 50 acres I'm

700
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,088
thinking of mids right but but a lot of

701
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:50,098
these a lot of these growers you know

702
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:53,628
who are even working big a lot of these

703
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:57,569
folks want to do you know healthy

704
00:26:53,628 --> 00:27:00,959
probiotic at scale and you know a lot of

705
00:26:57,569 --> 00:27:03,028
people who are small batch compost tea

706
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,009
living soil you know maybe even Korean

707
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:08,878
natural farming nerds like like I am

708
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:10,499
they get to a point where they're like

709
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:13,408
alright well that's that's fine for a

710
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:15,389
home grower or a patient grow but but

711
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:18,330
but we're gonna do a couple acres or

712
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:20,038
more you already mentioned once that

713
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:22,348
yeah you probably don't want to put the

714
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,829
compost down your water line because

715
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:27,598
there's residue and they're gonna be

716
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:30,628
aware of that first so so maybe just put

717
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:32,700
water down your lines but do you have

718
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:35,368
any recommendations for people who want

719
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,369
to scale it up to use it at size well

720
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:40,288
yeah absolutely owns one of my job is

721
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:42,988
that I inspect farms for our program so

722
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:45,450
I do see a lot of big scale farms and

723
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:47,848
humbled in Southern Oregon and what you

724
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,979
bake it with us on these farms are dry

725
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:52,950
ingredients and big tea Brewers if

726
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:55,139
they're they're you know 250 gallon

727
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:57,629
pallet kind of square ones is kind of a

728
00:27:55,138 --> 00:28:00,319
minimum up to they'll group you know

729
00:27:57,628 --> 00:28:02,699
three four thousand gallon tanks but

730
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,470
they're almost in every form I see now

731
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,660
because they are so beneficial and it's

732
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,019
they're so cost effect

733
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:11,180
you know as far as a natural fertilizer

734
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:13,129
you can add you absolutely can add in

735
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,529
nutrients you know to feed your plants

736
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:17,180
also so it's actually one of the most

737
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:19,399
cost-effective ways but it's done all

738
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,380
the time and they're they're just big

739
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,450
reservoirs that they brew it up in and

740
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,710
um you know for most of the commercial

741
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,559
growers the things that they're looking

742
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,450
for are helpful plant right because hey

743
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,720
you just need that but also it helps

744
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:35,000
resist pests so that's good and and they

745
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,650
want good yields right and this

746
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,019
absolutely both you know compost even

747
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:42,170
boots the yields and then and then of

748
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:44,960
course everybody needs you know bag

749
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,670
appeal right and what I have found and

750
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,700
granted I'm still pretty new with the

751
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:53,380
compost tea thing but um my coloration

752
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:57,590
seems to go up the the amount and

753
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,600
variety of the colors in in the hares go

754
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:00,949
up I like to think that there's more

755
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,009
trichomes I don't know if that's true

756
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:07,130
yet but it seems to boost all the

757
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:09,980
categories that you want if your end

758
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,840
goal is to sell right so there's some

759
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,089
there's some project bugs we use at home

760
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,279
when it's just for our just for our head

761
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:18,740
right but but but people who need to

762
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,149
make their margins they need to worry

763
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,490
about these other categories and I think

764
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,350
it does all of that - yeah that cost

765
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,970
effective is real important on big scale

766
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:28,399
farms you know they're they're not using

767
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,680
body nutrients it's ridiculous to ship

768
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,190
water yeah so you add your own water

769
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:37,220
on-site news you say substantial amount

770
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,650
of money so um what was the question

771
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,660
again I think you I think your email

772
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:45,290
that that yes it does increase your

773
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:47,090
yields your mag appeal and maximize the

774
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:49,279
potential genetics it just don't know

775
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:52,009
wonder love that thank you vet it

776
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,339
maximizes the potential of the genetics

777
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:58,129
I'm gonna use that I think you know it's

778
00:29:55,339 --> 00:30:00,230
built in the genetics but you're letting

779
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,640
it express itself silly and you do

780
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,558
usually get a lot more terpenes and

781
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,120
things usually

782
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,148
like tomatoes you know when you grow an

783
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:08,888
organic or aerosol base for like they're

784
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:11,319
better they taste better it's hard to

785
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:13,628
quantify but it's a-you know when you're

786
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:16,928
using a market knows it yeah the market

787
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:19,898
absolutely knows and people are becoming

788
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:21,909
more and more aware especially the

789
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:24,518
pesticides and that you know you you

790
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:26,379
have to find other methods and for years

791
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,048
it was kind of in you know a nasty part

792
00:30:26,378 --> 00:30:31,599
of our business and but the consumers

793
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:34,210
are important in their more demanding as

794
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,069
they should be so the depth that

795
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,528
definitely the direction I see in the

796
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:43,028
industry is definitely going organic in

797
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:44,528
high quality and that's that's what it

798
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:46,450
just cost effective end it's a better

799
00:30:44,528 --> 00:30:48,099
product there's no doubt about that I'm

800
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,269
actually really excited about my tomato

801
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:50,709
plants this year cuz you know I grow a

802
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:52,210
girl few every year because you know

803
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,440
even though you buy tomato plants at the

804
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,889
store it's still nice to have some at

805
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,100
home right

806
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:59,498
and so my tomato plants are near my

807
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:02,048
personal patient plants right so just a

808
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:03,519
few of them and and so you know I give

809
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:05,168
some of my cannabis plants which is why

810
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,490
I originally got into it but then like

811
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,499
I'm given some love with the tomato

812
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:11,319
plants as well so I'm looking forward to

813
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,999

814
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,668
gardens I donate a lot and they get

815
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:17,950
amazing amazing results in vegetable

816
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:19,659
gardens yeah compost teas help all

817
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,548
plants you know grab you know I think

818
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:23,019
they using the long golf courses and you

819
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:25,148
know it's just really it bringing in

820
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,769
brings out it makes you your plants

821
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:29,079
healthy and inoculate it's a grand

822
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:30,099
inoculate against against um it's just

823
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,569
biodiversity

824
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:32,769
it's basically what you're doing yeah

825
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:37,200
you're you're you're you're you're

826
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:40,450
you're supporting nature to do nature

827
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,519
like maybe a bionic way that's a real

828
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,929
interesting area if there was just the

829
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,028
tip of the iceberg what we're finding

830
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:48,159
out there's tons of information readily

831
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:50,499
available on brewing compost teas it's

832
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,149
not difficult like you said it seems a

833
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:54,368
little daunting but basically an air

834
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:58,388
source of vessel and some clean water

835
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:01,209
and start go from there right on so so

836
