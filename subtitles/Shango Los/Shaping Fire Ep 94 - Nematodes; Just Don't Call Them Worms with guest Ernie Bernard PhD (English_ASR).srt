2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,798
when i was new to cultivation i saw soil

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:15,359
as dirt it wasn't alive it didn't have

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,879
life except for maybe worms and i just

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,640
filled pots with it

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,640
and it makes sense that i would think

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,439
that because i was raised being taught

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,000
to sterilize my soil with fire before

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,518
using it in pots and sterile soil is

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,439
dead soil

11
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,439
i held onto that perspective for a long

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,920
time then i started learning about the

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,238
soil food web because i wanted to grow

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,800
thriving cannabis plants

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,959
all it took was seeing just one elaine

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,919
ingham diagram of all the life that

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,160
inhabits wild soil to immediately jerk

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
me out of that false reality and i

19
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,718
realized that soil was teeming with life

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
teeming with microbes and a host of

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,920
other participants and then i understood

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,799
that complexity of life was everywhere

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
in soil fresh water the oceans and the

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,159
air

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,640
all this microbiology was all around me

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,319
and i was essentially swimming in it

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,118
and the more i read books and got

28
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,599
educated the more i realized that every

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,680
minute player in living soil had an

30
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,559
important role to play in the soil food

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
web

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,040
and that seems beautiful to me and if

33
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,399
you're here with us listening today you

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,840
probably find it beautiful too

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
if you want to learn about cannabis

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,359
health cultivation and technique

37
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,879

i'm your host shango los

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,280
my guest today is dr ernest bernard dr

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,280
bernard is a plant and soil nematology

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,439
researcher in the entomology and plant

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,719
pathology department at the university

62
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,878
of tennessee

63
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,959
looking at his professional resume i see

64
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,719
he was already a graduate assistant

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,598
researcher in entomology at michigan

66
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,759
state university in 1972 which means

67
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,000
that he has been studying entomology for

68
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,318
longer than i have been alive

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,400
in 2010 he was awarded outstanding

70
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,958
scientist of the year for biodiversity

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,159
education by discover life in america

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,479
and enact a teaching award in 1999.

73
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,719
last year he was awarded a team grant to

74
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,759
study microplastics and the soil food

75
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,080
web

76
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,239
dr bernard has also served as co-author

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
on several mycology publications and

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,000
illustrated several papers on new

79
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,079
occurrences of plant diseases which is

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,759
cool right not only does he publish

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
scientific papers but he does the

82
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,518
illustrations too

83
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,318
finally ernie teaches a university

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,920
course on classic film noir today we're

85
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,598
going to talk about nematodes or

86
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,679
nematodes as i learned it's properly

87
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,598
pronounced it is important to point out

88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
in advance that we really don't know

89
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,839
very much about nematodes and cannabis

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,159
yet in fact we don't really have a

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,479
complete picture of nematodes at all

92
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,560
they are an under-researched participant

93
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,719
in the soil food web so my questions

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,719
today lead us on a few paths which there

95
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,719
are not solid answers for yet and i'm

96
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,120
very appreciative to dr bernard for

97
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,120
being vocal about where the science ends

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,480
and pointing out fertile areas for new

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,158
research

100
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,719
during the first set we will talk about

101
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,120
the physiology habits and life cycle of

102
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,439
nematodes the second set is all about

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,840
the beneficial activities of nematodes

104
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,000
both as a pest predator and essential

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,598
participant in the soil food web and

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
during the last set we talk about

107
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,238
parasitic nematodes and how to avoid

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,799
them establishing in your garden i spent

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,640
over a year researching nematologists

110
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,480
looking for one who had the depth of

111
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,798
knowledge on nematodes

112
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,919
was familiar with the cannabis plant and

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,319
was willing to talk publicly about both

114
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,958
and they're incredibly rare right there

115
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,639
are not many people studying nematodes

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,840
fewer who are studying nematodes in

117
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,000
cannabis and nearly none researching

118
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
nematodes cannabis and are willing to

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,800
talk about it publicly so special thanks

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,199
to joe romaneki at the entomological

121
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
society of america for helping me find

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
dr bernard

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,079
welcome to shaping fire dr bernard uh

124
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,638
glad to be here shango it's uh it's a

125
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,800
pleasure so glad to have you so you know

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,918
at the very beginning let's clarify

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,319
something that is um often confused in

128
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,719
the cannabis cultivation scene but as i

129
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,879
was preparing for our interview today

130
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,520
it's actually you know kind of confusing

131
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,439
for some people even in the science

132
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,799
literature which is

133
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,399
is a nematode an insect or not because

134
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,680
you know people are often referred to

135
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,599
them as worms but taxonomically they are

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
classified with insects in the same

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,439
clade and so to get us all on the same

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,879
page would you would you kind of sort

139
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,199
that out for us

140
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,680
well i jokingly tell my students in the

141
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,120
in my classes that if they use the term

142
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
worm for nematodes they're going to lose

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
some points

144
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,000
that comes about because they were

145
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,679
originally known as roundworms uh

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,120
there's even a group of animal parasites

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,280
called whipworms

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,840
uh so the word worm is in there but it's

149
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,679
okay as long as you say roundworms or in

150
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,198
britain they say eel worms

151
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,120
but nematodes are actually their own

152
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,240
phylum they're a separate

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,959
completely separate group of organisms

154
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
of a million species or more probably

155
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,120
uh well separated from the arthropods

156
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,599
which is where the insects are the other

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
arthropods are things like spiders mites

158
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,879
crustaceans lobsters those sorts of

159
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,079
things

160
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,719
however

161
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,639
in recent years there there is some uh

162
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
molecular evidence that there is some

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,240
kind of relationship between the two

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,079
groups because they both they're the

165
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
only groups that really shed their skins

166
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,800
in order to grow

167
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,879
so so but but they're not segmented

168
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,239
right so they're not no they're not

169
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,478
segmented at all

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,199
i mean no one would expect them to be

171
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,439
related except the very most remotely

172
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
just like we would be to uh

173
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,399
uh

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
earthworms but

175
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,399
there is some molecular evidence that

176
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,879
they could be related but you have to go

177
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,719
way back way back in deep time

178
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,120
to to actually

179
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,440
figure that out and there there are

180
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
basically no nematode fossils out there

181
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,399
and hardly any insect fossils uh that

182
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,239
are earlier than 400 million years old

183
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,959
so if we want to be correct when we

184
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,079
speak about nematodes and uh they're

185
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,839
they're

186
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,719
you know we'd lose points we call them

187
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,599
worm

188
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,600
um

189
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,160
but they're not exactly insects what

190
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,319
what is the best word for us to use to

191
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,319
describe them let's call them nematodes

192
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
just give them give them their own

193
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,639
their own category okay very good that's

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,918
right okay thanks so

195
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,960
i know that we're going to be talking

196
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:06,000
about a smaller subset of the nematodes

197
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,359
that exist um today because as you said

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,319
we think that there might be up to 100

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,319
million species which is enormous um

200
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,160
well a million a million a million i

201
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,160
said a hundred million

202
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,160
dollars

203
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,199
so we'll be talking mostly about the

204
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,159
ones that interact with the cannabis

205
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,160
garden today but but generally nematodes

206
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,360
what is what is their range are they

207
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,439
just about everywhere on the planet

208
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,919
nematodes are everywhere where there can

209
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,800
be a plant bacteria

210
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,038
moss or organic matter occurring so

211
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,319
anywhere you think of that's not covered

212
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,439
permanently by the snow has nematodes

213
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,919
the uh

214
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,519
in the antarctic dry valleys the highest

215
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,279
forms of life there are three species of

216
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,198
nematodes

217
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,038
um and you want to go up the tops of

218
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,478
mountains i've collected them off the

219
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,719
tops of uh you know haleakala in hawaii

220
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,318
and uh several other places so they're

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,960
everywhere right now they are they're

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,879
literally everywhere and uh every step

223
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,959
you take outside

224
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,560
uh you are stepping on the homes and

225
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,239
number toads

226
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,079
um i've read that they um outnumber

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,560
other animal species both in individuals

228
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,680
and in species counts pretty much

229
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,800
everywhere they live and so it to to tie

230
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,000
this into cannabis container gardening

231
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,759
would it um would it be fair to say

232
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,839
that in our

233
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,918
containers or beds where we're growing

234
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,240
cannabis that there are more nematodes

235
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,199
and more varieties of nematodes than

236
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,639
anything else in the soil

237
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,879
uh

238
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,559
when if you set up a container i assume

239
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,480
you set it up with uh

240
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,639
with basically sterile media or

241
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
something that's been steam sterilized

242
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,399
something like that there'll be no

243
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,399
nematodes there at the beginning but

244
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,480
gradually they come in they are brought

245
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
in by insects that they're blown in in a

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,800
dry form

247
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,720
and will colonize that the medium

248
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,879
however the difference is you can you're

249
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,680
not likely to get plant parasites

250
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:15,039
in containers um unless you're kind of

251
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,599
sloppy and you're introducing field soil

252
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:21,599
so i would say that for this particular

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,320
um audience that is exactly what we do

254
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,639
so uh with with much which much of the

255
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,000
people you know i know your expertise is

256
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:34,000
uh with uh with growing hemp and so much

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,958
of that world is sterilizing um

258
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,278
uh the soil because it's going into this

259
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,919
controlled environment uh usually of the

260
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:44,320
greenhouse um for most of people who are

261
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:47,519
listening to this show though they are

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,440
um regenerative growers who are wild

263
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,679
crafting inputs um using no-till

264
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,279
techniques for their pots using last

265
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,519
year's soil

266
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:01,600
bringing in um

267
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,240
fermented plant juices from the wild so

268
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,759
most of the people here have got pretty

269
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,399
wild uh pretty wild soils and the goal

270
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,759
for most of us is to

271
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,759
try to to keep that that wild bronking

272
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,919
bowl of soil

273
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,559
in enough balance so that we can take

274
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,759
advantage of the thriving

275
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:26,399
um living soil culture um without it

276
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,639
getting out of balance and then you know

277
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,720
developing you know fusarium or whatever

278
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,360
whatever it may be right

279
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,200
so it sounds to me that if many of us

280
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,000
are uh are are including wild crafted

281
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,879
bits even even if we started with with a

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,078
um

283
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,360
a bagged soil we're we're intentionally

284
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:50,479
mucking it up um ourselves it sounds

285
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,120
like there's all there is going to be a

286
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,560
slew of both number and variety of

287
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,200
species of nematodes in in all of our

288
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,919
pots it sounds like over time you'll end

289
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
up with uh i it's hard to say how many

290
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,719
will end up there depends on the

291
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,079
surrounding environment

292
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,839
and what is

293
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,559
what is directly affecting those pots

294
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,800
what's flying in what's blowing in uh

295
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,639
but yes you'll end up with a variety

296
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,679
primarily bacterial feeders some fungal

297
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,519
feeders

298
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,319
even some possibly some predators in

299
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,480
there

300
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,800
uh if you get unlucky you'll have you'll

301
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,039
have a plant parasite that can attack

302
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,958
uh the plant the plant roots the

303
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,439
especially if

304
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,439
i'm not i'm not familiar with uh with

305
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,920
pot culture or of

306
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,680
of hemp but um

307
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,759
if you have other plants around that

308
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,479
you're not too careful about or a close

309
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,120
proximity to affected fields then you

310
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,000
run a greater risk of somehow absol

311
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,278
accidentally introducing these nematodes

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,399
how much uh do nematodes uh travel uh

313
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:55,919
with with some uh both you know both

314
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,078
pests and beneficial uh um life forms

315
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,519
you know sometimes you can put pots

316
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,759
pretty close to each other and they

317
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,560
don't go from pot to pot but then

318
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:07,360
sometimes you if there's too close just

319
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,679
simple splashing of water will spread

320
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,600
them around so so what what is the

321
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,799
distance of travel for a nematode

322
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,120
usually

323
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,439
well nematodes don't aren't exactly

324
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,120
world travelers um

325
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
the fastest one

326
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
that i

327
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
well

328
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,000
why that that is such a general question

329
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,519
it depends on the kind of nematode uh

330
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
a lot of the bacterial feeders move in a

331
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,159
pretty good clip and it could probably

332
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,959
travel a few centimeters

333
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,319
uh per day if they really were trying

334
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,319
uh plant parasites don't move very far

335
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,959
most none of them are really what you

336
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,959
would call moving huge distances i think

337
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,759
the record is the burrowing nematode in

338
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,518
florida soils can move about three feet

339
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,919
but that's only in soil they're not

340
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,320
going to climb out of a pot and then

341
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,078
climb up another pot and get in however

342
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,600
yeah splashing water is a great way for

343
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,799
them to get around in fact any kind of

344
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,159
flowing water it's good for moving

345
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,799
nematodes

346
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,319
and they they can rely passively on

347
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,519
some breeze if they happen to be in the

348
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,879
right spot

349
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,799
if you have leaf litter that happens to

350
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,639
have some of clondon

351
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,958
another problem is that some nematodes

352
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,639
are can undergo anhydrobiosis which

353
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,119
means they dry out

354
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,959
but they're still alive they have a

355
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,799
physiology that allows that and those

356
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,439
are easily blown around

357
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:27,120
oh i see when they're dry and lighter so

358
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,720
so if we are experiencing a uh a pest

359
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,000
nematode issue which we'll talk more

360
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,079
about later um this is clearly a case

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,039
where our first line of defense is going

362
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,759
to be

363
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,838
uh material control so right you know

364
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,600
sanitation yeah sanitation don't spread

365
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,320
your don't splash your water don't

366
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,560
spread your soil um when you're

367
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,000
don't let your leaf litter go from one

368
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,119
plant to another all those basics right

369
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,159
so um

370
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,078
you know

371
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,278
there are so many uh nematodes and and

372
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,359
from this point forward we're going to

373
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,559
start focusing more on the ones that

374
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,759
interact with the cannabis plant

375
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,479
you know compared to the overall

376
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,240
nematode world of a million species how

377
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,079
many are

378
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,879
are we generally going to be dealing

379
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,679
with

380
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,360
in a living soil and cannabis

381
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,278
environment

382
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,879
if you're talking about like field soil

383
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,958
um which is what i would be most

384
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,879
familiar with i still would say it's a

385
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,198
black hole because there's been

386
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,000
basically no field research done

387
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,159
uh done yet the crop is too new uh

388
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,639
nematologists are not really have not

389
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,039
really geared up a lot to do that yet

390
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,360
but you would have the typical in a

391
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,399
handful of soil you'd probably have

392
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,720
uh 20 to 40 species

393
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,759
of nematodes some more abundant than

394
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
others

395
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,919
in a whole field

396
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,399
you might be talking 200 300 400 species

397
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,919
of nematodes most of which would not be

398
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,600
plant parasites

399
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,559
but would be predators or bacterial

400
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,079
feeders or fungal feeders

401
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,239
so we're kind of at a black hole with

402
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,638
regard to what is actually

403
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,240
happening at this moment

404
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,720
so for for many uh cannabis cultivators

405
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,120
we are most familiar

406
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,160
with the um

407
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,560
with the the bugs of all varieties that

408
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,159
we can see right because when when you

409
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,479
can see them you're more aware of them

410
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,399
you know to look you look them up and

411
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,959
and and generally they're easier to deal

412
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,559
with when you can see them

413
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:33,599
and so and and because um

414
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,159
microscopy skills are are still very

415
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
much growing in the cannabis cultivation

416
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,559
scene

417
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:42,319
not a lot of people are putting their

418
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,000
soil under microscopes yet um can you

419
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,278
describe for us

420
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,958
like the size relation of a nematode if

421
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,278
any of the ones that we're going to be

422
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,518
talking about are we can actually see

423
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,879
with the naked eye and and maybe a

424
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,320
little bit of what what they would look

425
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,078
like if we did throw one under a

426
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,680
microscope okay uh nematodes are the

427
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,000
word is actually nematode comes from the

428
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,879
word thread is that means thread-like in

429
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,039
greek

430
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,360
and uh it's because you can actually see

431
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,240
them with the naked eye but all you see

432
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,680
is a tiny little twisting white thing

433
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,959
maybe half a millimeter long to a

434
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,039
millimeter

435
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,319
some some species in the soil do get up

436
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,159
to a couple millimeters but really

437
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,839
they're quite small you can't make out

438
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,000
any detail like that

439
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,440
and they require and they can also

440
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,278
people can also mistake those from the

441
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,759
very small uh what are called enkei

442
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,759
trade worms they're true worms they're

443
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,800
white very small

444
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,959
small insect larvae

445
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,479
so what do they look like under the oh

446
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,638
another thing i should mention is they

447
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,839
don't nematodes don't

448
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,759
uh contract and and elongate like a an

449
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,279
inch worm or an earthworm

450
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,000
they not don't have the capability to do

451
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:49,360
that

452
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,759
so what do you look like under the micro

453
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,399
look for it in the microscope there is

454
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,839
the uh there's no segmentation so the

455
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,198
the body is not divided in major

456
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,880
divisions

457
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,958
there is uh

458
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,879
they're pretty simple that both ends are

459
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,918
usually rounded the tail end is kind of

460
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,160
pointed uh the important part of a

461
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,000
nematode is the mouth parts which we

462
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,360
call the stoma

463
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,439
because once you see the stone you know

464
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,599
exactly what that nematode does

465
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,798
if it's a wide if it's a wide open stoma

466
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,719
like a tube

467
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,000
it's taking a bacteria

468
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,600
it's got a thing that looks like a

469
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,759
hypodermic needle

470
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,838
it's called a stylet it either is a

471
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,519
plant parasite or a fungal parasite or

472
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,038
it could be a predator

473
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,440
and there are some with large teeth

474
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,879
inside that are probably predators

475
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,558
so it

476
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,000
the front end of the nematode is the

477
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,399
business end as far as determining what

478
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,400
it is and we can determine that

479
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
one can determine that at uh you know

480
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,519
relatively low power

481
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,119
10 or 20 uh

482
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,759
100 100

483
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,759
x would probably work

484
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,119
the problem is actually getting them out

485
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,720
of the soil

486
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,759
and that's where

487
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,519
we have

488
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,599
specialized techniques for doing that

489
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,038
they're not complicated but they do

490
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,038
involve a little bit of time and effort

491
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,038
to float them out of the soil so you can

492
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,359
actually get some

493
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,519
what is that technique for for gathering

494
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,599
worms we talk often about adding you

495
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,359
know melons or avocados to the top of

496
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,439
the soil which pulls you know regular

497
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,359
earthworms up but now you've now you've

498
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,798
got my attention here what what is this

499
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,399
what is this trick

500
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,558
all right well um

501
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
it's not really a trick uh but that

502
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,399
watermelon thing is interesting you

503
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,080
probably if you uh if you left that

504
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,519
there for several days and dropped

505
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,079
pieces in water you probably get some

506
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,759
nematodes coming out that have been that

507
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,199
were near the surface are attracted into

508
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,119
it or reproducing that would be kind of

509
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,798
cool i gotta i'm gonna have someone try

510
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,678
that um

511
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,279
so the technique we we use is called uh

512
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,720
it's called the sugar flotation

513
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,960
centrifugation

514
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,319
and it's a probably more than what most

515
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,720
growers want to do

516
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,879
but uh what it is is you take a soil

517
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,038
sample like a handful of soil you put it

518
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,600
in a beaker you fill it up to about

519
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,519
about 800 mils you mix it up really well

520
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,480
then you pour it through nested screens

521
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,839
we use an 80 over a 400 so a 400 mesh

522
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,160
screen is about

523
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:07,519
i think 35 micrometer openings on the

524
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,320
holes maybe 25 i think it's 25. so very

525
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,879
tiny holes so the the top screen the 80

526
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,119
mesh is about half a millimeter it

527
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,520
catches most of the debris and you end

528
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,399
up with the nematodes and the finer

529
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,960
material on this very fine screen so the

530
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,640
bottom screen is to catch the nematodes

531
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
then you put it then you rinse those

532
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,759
into a centrifuge tube

533
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
spin them

534
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,119
spin them down

535
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,919
pour off the water

536
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,239
add a sugar solution

537
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,400
and mix it up and spin it again

538
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,440
the sugar solution has the same

539
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
uh

540
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,038
density as a nematode body

541
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,798
so when you put it through the

542
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,879
centrifuge again the soil goes to the

543
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:50,000
bottom of the tube the nematodes stay in

544
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,840
suspension and we can pour that off

545
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
uh that's how we do it in our lab but

546
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,319
there are simpler methods involved

547
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,480
um and this this might be really

548
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,558
practical for people that don't don't

549
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,558
have a centrifuge and all the all the

550
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,038
other equipment is um it's called a

551
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,480
belay it's called a bearman funnel

552
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,480
there's actually a variation also called

553
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,599
a bearman pan but they're basically the

554
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,798
same thing

555
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:16,000
you have a very fine screen or or just

556
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,000
kind of porous tissue

557
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,400
in fact nematodes are once once said to

558
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,359
uh be be in operation as long as they

559
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,400
had a funnel and a piece of toilet paper

560
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,479
so inside so you have a funnel and you

561
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,159
have a screen inside

562
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,400
that fits inside that funnel and you

563
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,480
just cut that out of anything

564
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
aluminum screen or something and then

565
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
you lay a piece of

566
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,558
tissue over it and it can really be just

567
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,798
like one layer of kleenex

568
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,319
you put your soil yeah at the bottom of

569
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:47,279
this of the

570
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,038
funnel

571
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,319
you attach a tube like with a piece of

572
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:51,839
rubber tubing

573
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,359
attach the tube then you fill it up with

574
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,038
water

575
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,519
you put in your screen

576
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,440
the tissue

577
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,119
add your soil very gently on the top not

578
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,960
very much you want it be kind of

579
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:07,119
submerged make sure it's uh damp or wet

580
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,319
then the active nematodes are gradually

581
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,959
wiggle through

582
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,038
to the bottom fall through the screen

583
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,558
and sink into this tube

584
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,200
and after two or three days you can take

585
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,000
that tube off and let's see what you got

586
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
um

587
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
that requires active nematodes are

588
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,279
active

589
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,240
and some of them some of them aren't

590
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,720
very active but it will give a fair idea

591
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,679
of what what you might have out there

592
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,000
right so

593
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,320
yeah it's it's that's that method has

594
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,759
been around a long time and and and i

595
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,079
think you and i and i agree with you

596
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,759
that um there are there are probably few

597
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,839
uh cultivators who are going to do the

598
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,679
first version and there's probably even

599
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,119
a few um

600
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,960
cultivators that would bother to do the

601
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,038
second version but the reason why i

602
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,720
wanted it included is because if

603
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,839
somebody's listening to this show

604
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,079
because

605
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,038
um they are either curious to know you

606
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,279
know

607
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,798
what number of nematodes they have in

608
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,359
their um

609
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,918
in their growing environment or if they

610
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,759
suspect that they their substrates being

611
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,320
taken over by nematodes which we'll talk

612
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,640
more about later um you know that that

613
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,639
would be a great tool for you to for

614
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
somebody to do that and go oh my god

615
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,440
look at all these nematodes um i i think

616
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,678
i need to look into this more

617
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,120
so see the other i i should also point

618
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,919
out the other thing they can do in that

619
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,879
case

620
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,038
and if it's uh if they're don't have a

621
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,360
problem with it is they can send samples

622
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,000
to their extension agent or extension

623
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,000
offices every state has them and you've

624
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,200
probably heard that before

625
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
and uh

626
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,279
and

627
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,359
get a nematode analysis done

628
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,038
and and you know luckily these extension

629
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,119
offices are becoming more and more

630
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:48,640
comfortable with with talking to us

631
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,399
cannabis folks so uh so hopefully um

632
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,080
you know your mileage may vary on that

633
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,360
but hopefully you get somebody who's

634
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,798
open to us

635
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,158
so you know one of the things that we

636
00:22:54,798 --> 00:23:02,639
talk about a lot on shaping fire is um

637
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,679
the the the living soil of food web and

638
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,919
how

639
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,960
the the different participants in the

640
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,600
rhizosphere are doing different jobs

641
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,558
that when they all come together

642
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,678
you have a thriving healthy soil that's

643
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,639
imbalanced that is not susceptible

644
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,120
to

645
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,360
you know disease outbreaks and and you

646
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,199
know you'll have a really good uh flower

647
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,678
run and that's that's what we all shoot

648
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,840
for um i don't think many of us

649
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,640
understand the role that nematodes play

650
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:39,199
in that that you know

651
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:41,278
beautiful melody that is the soil so um

652
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,798
would you kind of walk us through you

653
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,480
know essentially day in a life a

654
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,440
nematode what are they spending their

655
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,240
time doing and so so that we can

656
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,000
understand their purpose a little better

657
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,359
okay um

658
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,200
well nematodes because they do

659
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,798
have different feeding strategies occupy

660
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,919
a pretty broad range inside the so in

661
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,599
the soil

662
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,360
so you have so

663
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,558
if we start with the let's just start

664
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,439
with the

665
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,278
uh

666
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
we get leaf litter or other organic

667
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,679
matter

668
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,000
lying on the ground

669
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,679
it's gradually consumed by

670
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,079
millipedes

671
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,519
isopods earthworms

672
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,599
and it gets broken down and uh the fungi

673
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,240
and bacteria then move in and are more

674
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,359
efficient at uh

675
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,599
at decaying and consuming this tissue

676
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,599
well

677
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,599
the nematodes actually come along then

678
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,880
the nematodes are there

679
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,719
to begin consuming bacteria and fungi

680
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,120
so this helps to

681
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,960
keep the cycle keep the entire nutrient

682
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:46,959
cycle going in the soil so they're

683
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,038
consuming uh bacteria fungi uh some are

684
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,120
predators that attack ami bay

685
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,079
um of course some are insect parasites

686
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,278
as well

687
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,199
and

688
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,720
they consume

689
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,000
those organisms

690
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159
and then they die

691
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,960
they become incorporated in the soil at

692
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,880
each level we're getting a breakdown

693
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,038
that provides

694
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,520
easier nutrition for plants

695
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,798
so you get this constant cycling organic

696
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,119
matter

697
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,240
of nutrition and soil so nematodes form

698
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,239
an important step in that they're

699
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,798
consuming fungi and bacteria that are

700
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,120
engaged in the uh

701
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:21,119
in the

702
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,840
um digestion of

703
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,599
organic matter

704
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,558
they don't actually it sounds to me like

705
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,879
that they would be very useful in

706
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:35,839
regenerating um out of balance you know

707
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,080
cropland or or or beds or something it

708
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,839
sounds like uh

709
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,480
they you know they are they are

710
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,720
digesting machines and if we're trying

711
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,759
to clean up beds that have got you know

712
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,600
bacterial outbreaks or something that um

713
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,240
you know they they are essentially

714
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,158
helping clean the environment and renew

715
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,079
it constantly

716
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,600
it's nice that you match your bacteria

717
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,960
because if you have

718
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,798
as many of the bacterial feeders have

719
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,600
very short lifespans or very short life

720
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,278
cycles some as little as two days oh wow

721
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,359
so from egg to adult

722
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,079
and so you can get huge numbers building

723
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,678
up

724
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,359
um

725
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,600
not on exactly the same thing we're

726
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,199
talking about but we did a

727
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,599
a graduate student at the university of

728
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,640
tennessee did a wonderful study on

729
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,678
uh

730
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,360
on

731
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,200
soil fauna

732
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,199
when cadavers are placed on top of the

733
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,120
soil we use beavers and human beings at

734
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,798
the at the

735
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,918
world famous body farm we say yes and uh

736
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,720
we found

737
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,559
bacterial feeders exploded in enormous

738
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,640
enormous numbers

739
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,519
uh hardly detectable before they're put

740
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,320
in there

741
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,558
and after two or three weeks we had

742
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,558
15 to 20 000 in

743
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,879
basically a handful of soil

744
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,720
so they respond very quickly to those

745
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,480
kinds of uh

746
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,960
um um imbalances

747
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,720
um so that

748
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,079
that has not i don't know how much that

749
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,319
has been tried but there have been some

750
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,480
really good studies recently

751
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,639
on the effect of

752
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,880
of re

753
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,278
of rebalancing

754
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,960
uh nematode communities in forests by

755
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,960
various means organic amendments or

756
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,798
whatever and it's founded it really has

757
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,000
improved the health and soil

758
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,720
it sounds like there's a lot of

759
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,919
opportunities for research in nematodes

760
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,278
right now you've mentioned a couple

761
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,120
different times that

762
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,519
either either there's an opportunity

763
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,119
somewhere or it's a black hole or the

764
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,759
research is new

765
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,319
and um you know it it sounds to me that

766
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,640
if if somebody is you know interested in

767
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,720
living soil and cannabis and and they

768
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,640
find nematodes interesting that there's

769
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,519
a lot of promising research to be done

770
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,919
there

771
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,278
oh definitely there's no end to it uh

772
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,440
and number two there aren't that many

773
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,558
hematologists in the world and most of

774
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,720
us are

775
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,918
working on crop protection so those are

776
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,558
working on

777
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,640
basic ecological questions are not uh as

778
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,678
numerous oh yeah they're

779
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,440
i

780
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,720
i and all my colleagues we all have so

781
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,519
many ideas that we're never going to get

782
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,679
to

783
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,000
just for sheer manpower or person power

784
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,159
that's that's about right right on all

785
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,240
right so um i think that just about uh

786
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,320
everybody who is here today is here to

787
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,319
be talking about uh beneficial nematodes

788
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,079
so so let's go ahead and wrap up this

789
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,158
first set and when we come back with set

790
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,839
two we're going to start off with uh

791
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,000
with the meat of the pie there on the

792
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,079
beneficial nematodes so we're going to

793
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,159
take a short break and re be right back

794
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,480
you are listening to shaping fire and my

795
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,320
guest today is dr ernie bernard now

796
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
without these advertisers shaping fire

797
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,000
would not happen so please support them

798
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,390
and let them know that you heard them on

799
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,839
shaping fire

800
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,278
[Music]

801
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,199
one of the challenges with buying

802
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,440
autoflower seeds is that often you'll

803
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,360
have as many different phenos as you

804
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,519
will have seeds in a pack

805
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,839
that can be fun sure but so many

806
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,599
varieties in one pack is a sign of an

807
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,959
immature seed line that hasn't been

808
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,038
worked enough

809
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,720
i prefer my autoflowers to be worked

810
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,720
enough that each pheno in the pack

811
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,038
really captures the aspects that the

812
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,000
breeder was intending

813
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,839
this is why i recommend gnome automatics

814
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,640
to my friends and listeners who grow

815
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,398
automatic flower and cannabis seeds

816
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,240
gnome automatic seeds are not just

817
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,959
crossed and released they are

818
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,519
painstakingly sifted again and again

819
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,759
tested in a wide range of conditions and

820
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,960
taken to a level of maturity that each

821
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:25,119
plant will be recognizable by its traits

822
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,319
traits that were hard earned so that you

823
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,398
can have your best growth cycle ever

824
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,960
gnome automatics became a trusted and

825
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,278
loved brand in cannabis over the last 10

826
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,120
years as mandalorian genetics and

827
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,640
recently changed their name to gnome

828
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,558
automatics

829
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,440
the only thing that has changed is the

830
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,678
name founder dan jimmy continues to pour

831
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,759
his passion of breeding cannabis into

832
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,278
every variety he releases for you to

833
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,000
grow

834
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:55,440
check out the gnome automatics instagram

835
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,240
at gnome underscore automatics to see

836
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,720
the impressive plants folks are growing

837
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,038
you can score gnome automatic seeds in

838
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,038
feminized or regular at your favorite

839
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,119
seed provider listed in the vendors

840
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,960
section of their website

841
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,558

and my guest today is dr ernie bernard

955
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,000
so during the first set we got a better

956
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,320
idea of uh who our neighborhood nematode

957
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,320
is a bit about their life cycle what

958
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,720
their interests are and that there's so

959
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,079
many of them everywhere in the world um

960
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:34,638
but here in the second set we're going

961
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:37,440
to focus more on beneficial nematodes

962
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,480
in in both how we can use the nematodes

963
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,119
to um protect our plants in the garden

964
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,519
and the quality of soil and uh and then

965
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,079
also we'll we'll talk a bit about making

966
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,719
a an environment that's good for them to

967
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,079
live since uh since they are our allies

968
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:57,199
in uh in sustaining uh living soil so

969
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,000
ernie um you know the number one thing

970
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,879
that uh people in cannabis cultivation

971
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,920
turned to beneficial nematodes for

972
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,760
is fungus gnats because you know lots of

973
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,800
people um

974
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,079
they are they are inexperienced or they

975
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,880
and they over water or or they have got

976
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,480
a

977
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,440
a watering system that they find out too

978
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,358
late is uh watering a bit heavy and boom

979
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,000
you've got fungus gnats and and they're

980
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:28,078
super annoying and and and so people

981
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,719
their first thought is okay i need to

982
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,079
use the nematodes so so

983
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:37,039
if you would kind of walk us through

984
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,599
the relationship between fungus gnats

985
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:42,960
and their and their production of larva

986
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,880
and where the nematodes go come in to be

987
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:50,159
a helpful participant in our garden yeah

988
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,559
sirens fungus stats definitely um

989
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,159
a problem about everybody has it grows

990
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:55,279
anything i know we have them in our

991
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,639
greenhouse

992
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,240
and we also have a lot of millipede

993
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,078
cultures going in the lab for various

994
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,279
reasons and we get plenty of fungus

995
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,240
gnats in there can't seem to help it

996
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,160
so the larvae of fungus gnats and i'm

997
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,118
not a specialist on these but what what

998
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,319
i do know is i eat uh rotting organic

999
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,200
matter

1000
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,960
and so uh a lot of wet organic matter

1001
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,159
will mean a lot of fungus gnats

1002
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,559
developing

1003
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,799
especially if it's on the surface

1004
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,799
um

1005
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,160
i don't know that

1006
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,760
some of your listeners probably know

1007
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,078
better than me whether they actually

1008
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,640
attack cannabis roots themselves i think

1009
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,560
some of them will

1010
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,559
the nematode being talked about i don't

1011
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,159
recall the name of it but it is a animal

1012
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,159
pathogenic nematode i know it's

1013
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,838
available commercially quite a bit

1014
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:48,399
that's applied to soil that will infect

1015
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,759
those fungus gnat larvae

1016
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,519
and kill them before they become adults

1017
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,040
as long as he i'd say as long as the

1018
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,559
instructions are followed carefully they

1019
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,159
should work fine

1020
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:01,838
when you use the word infect um uh

1021
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,598
are we actually meaning like eat the

1022
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,599
larva they'll eat the larva or is there

1023
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,280
some kind of viral or bacteria that's

1024
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,760
passed i'm not sure how to take the word

1025
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,440
infect right and if i i can't quite

1026
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,599
remember the name of the species maybe

1027
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,960
you have a hand there that attacks

1028
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,039
fungus gnats

1029
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,039
but typically these nematodes are

1030
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,200
they're produced as

1031
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,519
anhydrobiotic juveniles so they're dried

1032
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,319
out they're in a dry state

1033
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,559
they're added to soil surface and wetted

1034
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,320
this revives them they take water up and

1035
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,400
they begin moving around again

1036
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,160
and they have they carry in there in the

1037
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,160
anterior part of their intestine a

1038
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,759
certain kind of bacterium

1039
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,838
when they enter when they locate a

1040
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,359
fungus nut they enter

1041
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:47,279
the the larva through a natural opening

1042
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,639
it i'm not sure on this one could be

1043
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,400
through the sphericals where the how

1044
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,358
they larvae breathe

1045
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,880
it could be uh through the back end

1046
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,519
they might even wiggle it through the

1047
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,320
mouth i'm not sure but they get inside

1048
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,159
and they defecate these bacteria

1049
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,760
the bacteria multiply rapidly

1050
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,838
prodigiously

1051
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,800
and that's what actually kills

1052
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:11,440
the larva the consumption of the

1053
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,640
tissues inside wow once they've consumed

1054
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,400
those

1055
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,000
uh well while they're consuming those

1056
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,639
now the nematodes are inside they start

1057
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,159
feeding crazy crazily on these bacteria

1058
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,239
because that's our food source not

1059
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,159
really the dad itself

1060
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,000
then they uh reproduce very quickly

1061
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,399
within a few days producing hundreds of

1062
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,480
thousands of new eggs

1063
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,440
that uh can later

1064
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,079
be get uh will hat in fact uh will hatch

1065
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,119
and produce infective larvae

1066
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,519
and so this is this is why uh nematodes

1067
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,559
are good both you know if you have an

1068
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:46,559
outbreak and and and also as a defensive

1069
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,799
mechanism to keep you from ever getting

1070
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,599
fungus gnats because if you've got a

1071
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,519
large population of nematodes they're

1072
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,559
constantly eating their way through

1073
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:58,559
larva and depositing this bacteria which

1074
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,358
which i'm guessing and hoping that this

1075
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:04,320
bacteria is also probiotic for the for

1076
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,000
the rhizosphere ah well here's the catch

1077
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,160
the bacterium only survives inside the

1078
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,960
nematode oh wow so

1079
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,559
so

1080
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,880
when these uh so

1081
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,519
envision a nematode

1082
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,358
female nematodes inside the the larva of

1083
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,199
the uh

1084
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,119
of the fungus gnat

1085
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,118
they're producing lots and lots of eggs

1086
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,519
those eggs hatch inside

1087
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,200
the larva of the the

1088
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,280
fungusnet larva

1089
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,279
and they're eating prodigiously now some

1090
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,400
of them will go to maturity and produce

1091
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,760
more eggs

1092
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,559
but most of them

1093
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,040
will

1094
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,279
will stop they'll reach a point

1095
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,199
there's a trigger inside with

1096
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,200
too much too many nematodes and not

1097
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:44,719
enough bacteria or something and they

1098
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,759
stop development

1099
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:51,118
and uh they on as the larva

1100
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,280
of the fungusnet larva dies these these

1101
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,440
larvae then begin to dry up

1102
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,720
but they ca they hold within

1103
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,880
part of their intestine and they hold

1104
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,799
some of these bacteria

1105
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,720
so now they are

1106
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,318
a package just waiting

1107
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,159
for another

1108
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,239
larva to come around under favorable

1109
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,559
circumstances

1110
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,799
that they can penetrate so yeah that's

1111
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,559
that's the uh that's the drum about

1112
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,680
these bacteria is they're not free

1113
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,199
living

1114
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,318
that's really interesting too though

1115
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,759
like what a what an amazingly specific

1116
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,719
evolved

1117
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,920
system and tool that is right carrying

1118
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,759
carrying your lunch with you when you

1119
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,838
move across country that's right it's

1120
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,839
really nice yeah that's pretty cool all

1121
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:34,480
right so another thing that sounds uh

1122
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,679
that that makes uh

1123
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,159
nematode seem like an obvious uh player

1124
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,239
against these fungus gnats is that if if

1125
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,239
i understand correctly like nematodes

1126
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,639
mostly live near the top of the soil

1127
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,959
right so they live exactly where the

1128
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,480
fungus gnat problem is

1129
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,838
right that's that's where you'd like to

1130
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,838
have them right in fact it's these uh

1131
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,679
these these kinds of insect parasitic

1132
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,239
nematodes usually have a

1133
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,759
a way to track prey um there are two

1134
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,479
different groups there's ambush

1135
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,440
predators and there are uh

1136
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,760
uh oh

1137
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,200
ambush and

1138
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,280
there's another group that's that

1139
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,439
actually seeks them out they they move

1140
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,359
around and i'm not using the right term

1141
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,720
one group just sits waiting

1142
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,799
some just sit waiting for a

1143
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:24,399
particular host to come along

1144
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,000
the other ones are called um

1145
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,838
that's embarrassing one way or another

1146
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,838
they chase they chase yeah

1147
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,960
um so um so let's let's move on to

1148
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,640
another um a variety of um of of pests

1149
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,318
that that people tend to turn to

1150
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,639
nematodes for now

1151
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:44,960
um you know in the in this the general

1152
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:48,239
nematode scientific literature you know

1153
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,440
western flower thrips are named as one

1154
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,399
of the

1155
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,720
um you know one of the best varieties

1156
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,280
that beneficial nematodes can be used

1157
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,519
against and and you know it is common

1158
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,000
for cannabis cultivators to read western

1159
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,559
flower thrips and even though i'm not

1160
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,519
aware of western flower thrip being a

1161
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:10,000
threat in cannabis we all see that word

1162
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,920
thrift right and we we all have such

1163
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,358
problems with trips

1164
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,480
and and

1165
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,880
we're really

1166
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,400
looking for good solutions that that

1167
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,720
people use the nematodes for for you

1168
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,440
know the cannabis thrips that we get but

1169
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:27,598
i've never actually seen the the

1170
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,559
evidence that that that is an

1171
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,519
appropriate match-up are you familiar

1172
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,799
with um you know any any system where

1173
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,239
the nematodes will go after our cannabis

1174
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,839
thrip varieties

1175
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,598
well there are thrips there are thrips

1176
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,078
that attack through there are nematodes

1177
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,838
that attack thrips but i've not studied

1178
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,119
them really very much

1179
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:48,960
i would love to know if that really

1180
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,400
works because our our greenhouses have a

1181
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,639
lot of uh

1182
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,680
greenhouse thrips

1183
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,279
and uh the black the dark brown ones are

1184
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,679
really bad

1185
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,760
so no i can't providing information on

1186
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,838
that surely that's that's cool like we

1187
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,720
said you know there's the the study of

1188
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,239
nematodes is a huge area and i don't i

1189
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,399
don't expect you to have something on

1190
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,439
everything but but i do know that you

1191
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,400
know

1192
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,039
you have uh studied um you know their

1193
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,280
interaction with the hemp plant and and

1194
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,838
and i don't know um how

1195
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,040
uh why the research is there that you've

1196
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:24,318
had the opportunity to do because like

1197
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:25,920
as we've already discussed there's

1198
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,960
there's a lot of different research to

1199
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,039
do but what i'm getting at is um have

1200
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,760
you um uh

1201
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:36,719
what other pests other than fungus gnats

1202
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,280
can you share with us that nematodes are

1203
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,759
effective in combating

1204
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,800
there are a lot of a lot of nematodes

1205
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,000
out there now and available commercially

1206
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,800
for all kinds of uh past grubs

1207
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,480
fly other fly larvae

1208
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,920
caterpillars

1209
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,199
there's a wide range of product

1210
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,240
available now

1211
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,000
that can be

1212
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,838
that can be used or at least tried

1213
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,599
anyway

1214
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,358
they have a lot of them have kind of

1215
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,519
specific environmental requirements has

1216
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,279
to be enough water not too much

1217
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:10,000
uh temperatures and things like that the

1218
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,800
way that they're applied

1219
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,199
but

1220
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,079
oh fleas fleas can be controlled this

1221
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:15,199
way

1222
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,920
um

1223
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:16,879
so

1224
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,519
but

1225
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,559
but each each pest pretty much has its

1226
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:22,800
own

1227
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,920
particular nematode that can attack it

1228
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,000
like several different kinds of

1229
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,680
caterpillars have one species

1230
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
uh beetle grubs might have a different

1231
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,039
species and there may be variants in

1232
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,880
there

1233
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,039
um

1234
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,800
i see so so i think i was i think i was

1235
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,279
actually approaching this from the wrong

1236
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,599
direction because what what i'm hearing

1237
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,240
is that there you know if if there's if

1238
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,680
there's a million or more species and

1239
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:49,838
and and i'm getting the idea that

1240
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:52,480
nematodes tend to be um you know uh

1241
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,679
picky eaters when it comes to

1242
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,838
um

1243
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:59,679
um other animals uh that that really

1244
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,199
what should happen is the the

1245
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:04,000
cultivators should

1246
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,000
find figure out and identify what their

1247
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,800
pest is and then kind of reverse

1248
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
engineer it to find what nematode is

1249
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,318
specific for theirs so it isn't like oh

1250
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,280
all right we're gonna add you know you

1251
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:20,318
know this one nematode which eats you

1252
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,319
know 20 variety of pests and we're just

1253
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,318
going to dump on it it actually takes

1254
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:27,440
some homework to make sure that we get

1255
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:29,838
the specific nematode that is correct

1256
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,599
for uh whatever our pest would be yeah

1257
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:34,239
you've got it there's a

1258
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,720
there are many different species of uh

1259
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:39,279
insect parasitic nematodes out there

1260
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:41,039
but they're they're not uh

1261
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,920
they're not generalists

1262
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,480
they may take a a small range of pests

1263
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,318
uh but you won't find any one one that

1264
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,400
will take care of everything i certainly

1265
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:51,759
wouldn't apply um

1266
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,160
something's used for beetle grubs trying

1267
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,079
to throw thrips that's just that's total

1268
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,199
waste in fact they're very different

1269
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,960
kinds of they're very different

1270
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,598
nematodes

1271
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,039
i think that uh some of us who got into

1272
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,400
beneficial

1273
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:10,000
uh insects by learning about um you know

1274
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,358
predatory mites that will um eat our

1275
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,480
pest uh

1276
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:15,039
two spot

1277
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,599
um uh spider mite you know you see the

1278
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,759
list it's like oh if i add this mite it

1279
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,640
eats these you know it attacks these

1280
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,800
nine different varieties of pests and um

1281
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,960
i think that i was approaching nematodes

1282
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,880
as like okay which one which nematode is

1283
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,318
the generalist that i want to focus on

1284
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,400
and that's that's not really the right

1285
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,639
way to think about it right right all

1286
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,880
right yeah it's funny that i i have to i

1287
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,358
have to mention this about using mites

1288
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,160
uh to control insect or control two

1289
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,960
spotted mites so we uh occasionally we

1290
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:47,199
have two spotted mite outbreaks um

1291
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,400
and thrips outbreaks in our greenhouses

1292
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,519
and we

1293
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,519
we do apply bio mild controls they're

1294
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:55,280
specific for these pests while i was

1295
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,039
watching once there was a nice thrip

1296
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,760
sitting there on a on the bottom of a

1297
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,838
leaf and a and a predator smite comes

1298
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,680
along approaches it it touches the

1299
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:06,000
thrips the thrips wiggles the mite runs

1300
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,000
away

1301
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,880
he wasn't supposed to do that

1302
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,720
it's like dude play your position

1303
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,358
[Laughter]

1304
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,358
all right so so if um if my approach

1305
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,440
with a looking for a nematode generalist

1306
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,598
wasn't accurate let's kind of uh change

1307
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,039
the direction of the conversation to

1308
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,559
creating an environment

1309
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,318
in the soil

1310
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,760
that will

1311
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:31,440
attract

1312
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,680
and um

1313
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,599
and provide a good home for the

1314
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,759
nematodes that we want because i'm

1315
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,559
starting to get the idea that um you

1316
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,720
know if if a soil is in balance it will

1317
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,480
naturally have healthy nematodes and

1318
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:45,838
then if we let our soil get out of

1319
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,079
balance

1320
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,358
we start to develop parasitic nematodes

1321
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,000
which we're going to talk about in the

1322
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:55,519
third set so what is the living

1323
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,400
environment that um you know the the

1324
00:47:55,519 --> 00:48:00,559
beneficial nematodes that we want to

1325
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,599
have thrive in our pots as our defense

1326
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,319
mechanism

1327
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:08,079
um what is that environment that they do

1328
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:10,079
best in and and and what can we do to uh

1329
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,960
make it a cozy place where they want to

1330
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,839
um produce

1331
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,838
well um

1332
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,519
wow that's a good question that's a big

1333
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,279
question

1334
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,759
what would i do

1335
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,960
if i want to grow really good cannabis

1336
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,960
or any crop really

1337
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,440
i would have

1338
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,039
a lot of organic matter

1339
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,960
i would keep it well

1340
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:42,880
uh keep the nutrition high in the pot

1341
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,838
i would avoid over watering and

1342
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:50,160
underwatering especially over watering

1343
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,358
um that is such a broad question and

1344
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:54,000
what you're what you're essentially

1345
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,558
describing is is is good container

1346
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
gardening right right and so yeah and so

1347
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:02,559
it sounds to me like like so long as you

1348
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,119
are um are

1349
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,640
doing the things that we know help

1350
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,318
with um

1351
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:11,759
with organic growing um and and you're

1352
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:13,679
not out of balance like you're not too

1353
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,400
dry you're not too wet you're not your

1354
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,440
your ph isn't off for the plant uh

1355
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,318
you're you're making sure to use compost

1356
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,159
teas uh you know so long as you're doing

1357
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,800
the things that we in the regenerative

1358
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,799
community like naturally do anyway for

1359
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,880
the good of the plant those are all the

1360
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,760
same things that a nematode wants as

1361
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,000
well

1362
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,760
that's for the bacterial feeders the

1363
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,400
well all nematodes will be happy with

1364
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,680
that in a container type situation

1365
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,599
you're going to end up largely with

1366
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:45,279
bacterial feeders and fungal feeders in

1367
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,240
the pot and that's um

1368
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,000
and those are the those are the

1369
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,479
nematodes what's responsible for getting

1370
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,519
good uh carbon nitrogen ratio

1371
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,880
i don't i

1372
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:54,159
there's uh some very complicated

1373
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,200
research very good research that we've

1374
00:49:54,159 --> 00:50:00,799
done at uc davis on

1375
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:03,279
on this approach of a balance of

1376
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,559
bacterial and fungal feeders

1377
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,240
um

1378
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,359
so yes you'll get both kinds in there

1379
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,719
because they're naturally brought in

1380
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,838
gradually

1381
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,838
by other insects they're blown in that

1382
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,159
rain i mean they could be picked up and

1383
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,759
carried by wind out of a field

1384
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,598
they planned parasites you're not likely

1385
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,640
to get um

1386
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,160
unless

1387
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:23,838
unless there's a breakdown in the way

1388
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,639
that you handle your stuff

1389
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:29,119
so so let's say that like you know i i

1390
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:31,598
want to have the nematodes in my pot and

1391
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,838
there is the way that you just suggested

1392
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,280
by you know letting them get there by

1393
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,078
happenstance

1394
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,119
but um but let's say that that i want to

1395
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,960
intentionally um you know equip the pot

1396
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,280
with it so as we've already talked about

1397
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,440
there's there are commercial varieties

1398
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,359
that are available um

1399
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,960
what i'm curious to know is is it

1400
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:55,598
possible to you know add the nematodes

1401
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,199
and create a

1402
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,960
a

1403
00:50:56,199 --> 00:51:01,838
self-replicating community where they

1404
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,800
are making more nematodes

1405
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,880
you know

1406
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,559
into the future or or or

1407
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,160
is their life cycle such i don't know

1408
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,000
maybe it's maybe it's too short or they

1409
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,078
don't reproduce enough or or whatever

1410
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,800
there might be about their life cycle

1411
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,318
where i i should be adding nematodes

1412
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,318
because you know some of some of the

1413
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:22,800
providers they suggest that you're

1414
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:25,039
you're hand adding nematodes every two

1415
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,599
weeks and and if that's what's necessary

1416
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:30,400
okay fine but but in my head and in the

1417
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,720
head of most of us into uh into living

1418
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,838
soil growing we would love to have there

1419
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:39,118
be a community of nematodes that like

1420
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:41,599
reproduces it and maybe even expands and

1421
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,640
and so we add them once but keep our

1422
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,599
soil good and and now we've got nematode

1423
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,719
nematode defense mechanisms forever like

1424
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,960
is that unreasonable is that

1425
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,039
unreasonable no actually i

1426
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,039
i would every two weeks means you're not

1427
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,880
effective at all um

1428
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,279
i would think that uh

1429
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,640
addition initial addition as long as the

1430
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,440
pot is fine

1431
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,799
and you have uh

1432
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,960
going to have soil that's naturally

1433
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,640
being colonized by bacteria

1434
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,358
and fungi they're just blowing it out of

1435
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,639
the air in the water supply so those are

1436
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,199
already present

1437
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,199
adding the nematodes they will they they

1438
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,598
should reproduce and continue to grow to

1439
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,558
a population that is sustainable inside

1440
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,400
the pot

1441
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,680
if they get too if they run out of food

1442
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,880
their numbers are going to drop it's

1443
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,318
just the supply demand thing and um

1444
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,440
until that builds up again then they

1445
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,800
will increase

1446
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,400
i don't i don't see why they would not

1447
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,519
why they would not maintain themselves

1448
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,880
these pots

1449
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,239
is there any reason um to add a food

1450
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,079
source for them

1451
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,759
you said that if if they grow in number

1452
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,960
where they outstrip their food source

1453
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,240
they'll just

1454
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,318
you know die or not reproduce as much um

1455
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:51,838
but i can i can totally hear the

1456
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,880
listeners who are saying yeah but i want

1457
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,719
to supercharge my pot with nematodes so

1458
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,880
can is there a bacteria that i can add

1459
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,719
so they'll eat more of it and you know i

1460
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,680
can see how that could be a dangerous

1461
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,598
road to go under but but but but let's

1462
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,358
let's ask the question anyway is there

1463
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,079
anything that we would want to feed the

1464
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:12,159
nematodes specifically like that or or

1465
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,640
is feeding the nematodes just keeping

1466
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,078
your pot in balance i think keeping your

1467
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,920
pot in balance i'm not sure what you

1468
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,480
would feed them with would you pour a

1469
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,519
bacterial broth in there or

1470
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,880
shove

1471
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,199
i mean i know that sounds dangerous but

1472
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,519
that is what i was imagining yeah yeah

1473
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,960
so i'm i'm not sure that

1474
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,039
i'm not sure how well that would work

1475
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,119
because you can rely on the naturally

1476
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:34,639
rapid reproduction of bacterial feeders

1477
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,800
somewhat slower than fungal feeders but

1478
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:38,480
you're going to rely on them to

1479
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,880
actually occupy

1480
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,719
their niche in that pot and

1481
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,400
all the places they can go

1482
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,558
and they'll be there

1483
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,240
and it may fluctuate up and down but

1484
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,440
that depends on the

1485
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:50,479
on the

1486
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,720
the

1487
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,199
background food sources they're living

1488
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,799
off you know

1489
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,838
dying roots or

1490
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,400
old cells or uh

1491
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,719
other organisms that might get in there

1492
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,680
now i i i've never heard of anyone

1493
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:09,118
actually augmenting a pot uh

1494
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,118
and getting result but then again the

1495
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,318
literature is pretty vast so i could

1496
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,838
miss something

1497
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:16,000
that's interesting and also you know the

1498
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,679
people the people in in the regenerative

1499
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,719
cannabis scene were kind of mad

1500
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:22,639
scientists and so you know i it would

1501
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,639
not surprise me at all that that

1502
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,960
somebody out there is all like oh well

1503
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,199
if they if they if they um if they eat

1504
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,639
bacteria what is what is the bacteria

1505
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,558
that i can produce and then they just

1506
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:33,920
start experimenting with it because

1507
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,519
because you know we all kind of consider

1508
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,358
ourselves citizen scientists even though

1509
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,000
it gets us in trouble sometimes

1510
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,679
oh no i think i think any kind of a

1511
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,079
experimentation where this formal just

1512
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,679
trying stuff is great um i mean how do

1513
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,359
we learn how do we learn anything if we

1514
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,598
don't do that

1515
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,000
so this is this is kind of an uh uh kind

1516
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,640
of a non-sequitur corollary question and

1517
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,400
um but so we'll just we'll see if you

1518
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,199
you've got something for me on this you

1519
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,760
know

1520
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:04,798
very often um uh people are directed to

1521
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,880
um add nematodes to their crops uh

1522
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:07,759
through a sprayer

1523
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,160
and

1524
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,640
there is a lot of discussion with not a

1525
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:15,759
lot of clarity about

1526
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,239
the varieties of sprayers or or or

1527
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,640
nozzle types to not use because some of

1528
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,118
the higher pressure ones

1529
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,440
can you know rip apart the nematodes as

1530
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,559
they're going through the nozzle is what

1531
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:32,159
i have been told but i don't have first

1532
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,680
person experience with this so um have

1533
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,440
do you have anything to share with us

1534
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:40,078
about um you know um application by

1535
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,400
spray best practices at all

1536
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,559
i i don't have anything specific on that

1537
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,760
but the products that when they're sold

1538
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,599
they should have a recommendation for

1539
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,920
what kind of square to use i certainly

1540
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,559
want to use a super high pressure one or

1541
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,240
one that puts out really fine droplets

1542
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,160
for a small operation maybe you could

1543
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:57,759
mix it up in a watering can and just

1544
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,598
water it in

1545
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,400
so um as far as like the living

1546
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,599
environments for the nematodes um

1547
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,760
we a lot of us like to mix up our own

1548
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,318
our own soil with the different

1549
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,480
amendments so it's you know kind of a uh

1550
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:15,358
it's it's it's perfectly made for our

1551
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,760
beloved cannabis plants um are there any

1552
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:21,279
soil amendments um

1553
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,920
uh that are specifically appreciated by

1554
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,920
nematodes

1555
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,318
well uh

1556
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,078
it never hurts to have uh organic matter

1557
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,199
of some kind in there in our greenhouse

1558
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,318
we use

1559
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,199
um we use commercial a commercial uh

1560
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:37,838
mix

1561
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:40,558
that we buy in bulk uh buy you die 10 or

1562
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:43,119
12 bales at a time

1563
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:46,640
and that i don't know how directly that

1564
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,960
affects them but allows for allows for

1565
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,759
better drainage we use we use basically

1566
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,760
pure sand with organic matter in it and

1567
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,480
uh the organic matter actually helps you

1568
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,400
think that sand would drain really fast

1569
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,400
but organic some organic man there

1570
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,559
really helps to drain it it just

1571
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,480
provides helps provide channels uh for

1572
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,960
them to move around in

1573
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,358
yeah and that makes sense um being worm

1574
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,400
like i can imagine that they would not

1575
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,838
like um compacted soil

1576
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,760
and and that you know that kind of

1577
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:17,838
starts us down where we're going to

1578
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,680
start with uh the next set where

1579
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,920
compacted soil is going to decrease

1580
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:24,639
their ability to move around and

1581
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,559
compacted soil also creates hydrophobic

1582
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,159
soil on the top and

1583
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,160
i'm getting the idea with since

1584
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:33,838
nematodes interact so effectively with

1585
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:35,279
water that they really do need a a moist

1586
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,078
but not

1587
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,440
sopping uh environment well you get one

1588
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,519
of the key points about nematodes

1589
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,440
nematodes are actually aquatic animals

1590
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:44,960
they require a water film to move around

1591
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,280
in in fact when they move they're

1592
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,480
pushing against a water film on a soil

1593
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,920
particle

1594
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,519
and

1595
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,519
they have no way of burrowing through

1596
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:54,719
soil themselves they need to have the

1597
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,280
connections

1598
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,719
the connectedness of the soil pores in

1599
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,480
order to get around

1600
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,959
so yeah you're right a very highly

1601
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,798
compacted soil is pretty much impervious

1602
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,000
to most but all to all but smallest

1603
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,159
nematodes

1604
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,599
it would seem then that uh this would

1605
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:13,440
also be a case for um like a a living

1606
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:15,200
green mulch some people might call it a

1607
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,358
cover crop or something but it's

1608
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,118
something small plants that live below

1609
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:21,279
the cannabis plants that have got roots

1610
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,680
going down that create

1611
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,319
highways for the water to go from the

1612
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:29,199
surface uh and and down into the

1613
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:31,279
rhizosphere it sounds like that kind of

1614
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,318
a a living

1615
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,880
moist

1616
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:37,119
root environment but would be one that

1617
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,119
nematodes would be like hell yeah we

1618
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,280
like living here yeah

1619
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,599
well that also provides additional

1620
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,760
uh food source more roots uh

1621
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,640
means more bacteria growing on the roots

1622
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,160
uh more fungi attacking attacking uh

1623
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,159
dead cells or even the live roots

1624
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,480
themselves so sure and probably more

1625
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,318
variety too since these different plants

1626
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,838
are very likely to have different types

1627
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,239
of bacteria on their roots than the

1628
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,519
cannabis plant exactly and

1629
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:03,199
you know there's a lot of specificity

1630
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:04,400
now we're finding out about bacteria on

1631
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,318
roots and

1632
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,798
and uh there is some specific

1633
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,079
specificity for nematodes that eat

1634
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:12,079
bacteria

1635
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,760
that may favor one kind of bacterium

1636
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,839
over another

1637
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,359
so so before we go to the second

1638
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:18,639
commercial break i want to talk a little

1639
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:19,598
bit about

1640
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:22,000
um

1641
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:25,119
who would predate

1642
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,798
our ally nematodes right so we're going

1643
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,000
through all this process we might you

1644
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:30,079
know we're

1645
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,920
we're either attracting nematodes or

1646
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,960
we're adding nematodes we're trying to

1647
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:38,079
keep our our soil in balance both for

1648
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,079
the plant but also for for all of our

1649
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,720
you know beneficials that are in the

1650
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,720
soil including the nematodes but you

1651
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,239
know i understand how the tree of life

1652
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:48,639
works enough to know that somebody's

1653
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:51,279
probably eating my nematodes

1654
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:53,838
so so who who are the threats to my

1655
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,000
beneficial nematodes in the pot

1656
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:58,318
or just anywhere that's that's a good

1657
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,199
question the there's a big uh

1658
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:03,440
big disparity between those that have

1659
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:06,399
get in pots easily like

1660
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,920
bacterial fungal feeders and predators

1661
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,680
the bacterial fungal feeders have very

1662
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,440
short lifespans

1663
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:13,440
but they lay a lot of eggs

1664
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,440
the predators are

1665
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,240
are have much longer lifespans at least

1666
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,599
fewer eggs they're also not they're not

1667
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,159
nearly as

1668
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,000
i don't know portable or transportable

1669
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,480
as the other nematodes are

1670
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,039
so it would be kind of uncommon

1671
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:33,358
to see uh most predators in those pots

1672
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,719
the other thing about the predators um

1673
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:35,920
something to keep in mind too is that

1674
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:37,919
we're talking predator prey

1675
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,358
relationships and nematodes it's no

1676
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,280
different for them than it is for like

1677
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:43,279
mammals look at lynxes and snowshoe

1678
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,440
rabbits you have

1679
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,680
you have a large prey population you

1680
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,480
have a small predator population

1681
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:52,399
and because of the differences in length

1682
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,599
of life cycle number of eggs produced

1683
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,200
they stay pretty much in those

1684
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,359
proportions

1685
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,759
i've never heard of uh let's say a

1686
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,199
predator population overwhelming

1687
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,119
um

1688
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:05,118
the prey there's always more prey coming

1689
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,599
along than there are predators

1690
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,358
well uh that is both surprising and good

1691
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,640
to hear because good to hear

1692
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,279
yeah exactly if we're gonna if we're

1693
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:14,798
gonna be um you know uh focusing on

1694
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,519
making sure that we've got enough

1695
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:20,318
nematodes uh in our growing environment

1696
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:23,199
um the idea that that they will just be

1697
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:25,440
there effectively unless we kill them um

1698
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:29,358
like that sounds that sounds pretty good

1699
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,720
so um what happens uh two you mentioned

1700
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:32,159
a little bit of this in the first set

1701
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,318
but i want to dig in a little more what

1702
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,000
happens when the environment does fall

1703
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:39,279
out of bounds you know like like there

1704
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,159
are varieties of microbes et cetera who

1705
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,720
if if the soil gets dry or the ph

1706
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,558
changes or something they'll cyst up and

1707
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:49,199
and and do what we kind of think of as

1708
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,920
hibernation with a protective outer

1709
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,118
shell of some you know of a mucus or

1710
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:58,318
something

1711
01:01:53,119 --> 01:02:00,240
um until the the conditions in the soil

1712
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,199
are favorable again right and then and

1713
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:06,719
then they restart their life cycle and

1714
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:09,358
um i'm curious to know what um

1715
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:11,358
what defense mechanisms nematodes have

1716
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,440
for that a because i want to hear you

1717
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,000
talk about that that body drying out

1718
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,119
cycle again but also i want to get a

1719
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,760
better handle on the idea that if if i

1720
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,318
um you know inadvertently

1721
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,079
drowned my pot um

1722
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:27,759
am i actually going to wipe out the

1723
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,119
nematodes or do i just need to wait for

1724
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,119
them to come back so i guess it's a

1725
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:34,000
combination question let's talk about

1726
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,760
the the flooding first

1727
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,280
back in the 50s and 60s all kinds of

1728
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,920
things tried to kill nematodes i wonder

1729
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,519
what's flooding let's flood a field

1730
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,798
and see how long it takes to kill all

1731
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,000
the nematodes

1732
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,838
it does work

1733
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,280
but you've you've also ruined your field

1734
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:51,199
um temporary flooding is not going to

1735
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,119
really damage your nematodes very much

1736
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:54,558
they're aquatic organisms and they they

1737
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,559
take in oxygen

1738
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,960
but they can become quiescent which just

1739
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:02,400
means they stop moving and they just

1740
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,480
stay quiet and just wait it out until

1741
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,318
water drains away more oxygen is

1742
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,519
available again and they can begin

1743
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:09,358
moving around again it'd be pretty

1744
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,599
difficult to do that unless you

1745
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:13,279
uh set a pot in a

1746
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,720
a cistern or something fill it up with

1747
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,760
water and just wait like did it

1748
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:19,598
intentionally right yeah yeah yeah so as

1749
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,200
far as drying out um the thing about

1750
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,359
soils drying out is you never really get

1751
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,879
them dry they feel dry but they still

1752
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,960
have a thin film of water around all the

1753
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,798
soil particles held on very very

1754
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,119
strongly and the nematodes themselves

1755
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:33,199
are held strongly in that in that very

1756
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,640
very thin layer of water and can't move

1757
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,598
but it doesn't mean they're necessarily

1758
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:39,279
going to die because the pot has dried

1759
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,760
now if you if you really let it go a

1760
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,319
long time towards really getting dry the

1761
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,200
nematodes many nematodes not all but

1762
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:46,838
many

1763
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:49,038
can undergo this process called

1764
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:50,798
anhydrobiosis which means life without

1765
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,799
water

1766
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:53,838
they undergo physiological changes that

1767
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:55,920
push

1768
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,679
certain compounds into their

1769
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,240
into their proteins to keep them

1770
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:02,960
deforming and then they they they lose

1771
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:04,558
almost all their water 95 of their water

1772
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,838
and they just sit there basically dry as

1773
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,079
dust

1774
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,920
but when water returns and this could be

1775
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,680
months or years later

1776
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,599
i think the record is

1777
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:15,118
oh i better not say i think it's more

1778
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,760
than 15 years

1779
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,760
they once water comes back they revive

1780
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:23,359
in anywhere from minutes to hours and

1781
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,960
just pick up like nothing ever happened

1782
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:26,480
wow well that's that's really convenient

1783
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,318
i'm glad you didn't it's nice isn't it

1784
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,679
yeah i'm glad to hear that they they're

1785
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:33,038
so likely to to rebound because um you

1786
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:35,519
know honestly

1787
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,280
it is so common

1788
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,838
uh you know maybe maybe not at a in a

1789
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:43,280
you know in an automated uh commercial

1790
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:45,440
setup but so much of of our audience is

1791
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,440
home growers and patients who are

1792
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:50,400
growing their own cannabis for their own

1793
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,838
ailments and and it is it is sadly very

1794
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:56,559
common for us to go from a from an over

1795
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:58,400
watered a drowned pot to oh gosh i added

1796
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,079
too much i better not water it for a

1797
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,920
couple days then now now it's on the

1798
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:03,920
other side and it's bone dry because

1799
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,920
they were trying to make up for for the

1800
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,680
over watering in which case now it's

1801
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,400
hydrophobic and then we drown it again

1802
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:09,838
right

1803
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,798
like you know

1804
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:12,480
yeah

1805
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:13,838
i made a mistake once in the greenhouse

1806
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,480
i was adding uh

1807
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:18,798
just we used peters as a supplemental uh

1808
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,719
fertilizer and i

1809
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,880
i added too much

1810
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,480
uh inadvertently i hope and when i

1811
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,480
looked at the plants the next day they

1812
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,679
were all wilted and i don't want to lose

1813
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,440
these young

1814
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,358
these young hemp plants

1815
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,798
so i just watered the heck out of them

1816
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,239
to wash that fertilizer through and sure

1817
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:37,119
enough they revived

1818
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:38,239
so it's it's not a total loss

1819
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,000
well that's great because there's so

1820
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:41,838
many other ways for us to make mistakes

1821
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,159
and kill everything in our pots it's

1822
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:46,239
it's nice to know that um somebody's got

1823
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,239
the ability to rebound a little better

1824
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,879
than some of our other allies

1825
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:52,879
so all right so uh let's go ahead and

1826
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,880
take a commercial break when we come

1827
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,760
back we are going to talk about uh

1828
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,760
parasitic nematodes uh what many of us

1829
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,200
consider pest nematodes even though

1830
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,000
they're uncommon we're gonna we're gonna

1831
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,558
learn about them and uh and and talk

1832
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,559

1836
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:18,000
for years organic cultivators have been

1837
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:20,000
looking for a peat moss replacement peat

1838
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,679
moss has long been the go-to soil

1839
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
amendment for water retention and

1840
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:26,558
container growing but organic growers

1841
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,119
are recognizing now that peat moss is an

1842
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:32,000
unsustainable resource and the mining of

1843
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,318
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and

1844
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,639
releases sequestered carbon

1845
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,558
but peat moss works so well that many

1846
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:41,038
have continued to use it

1847
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:43,280
now there is finally a revolutionary

1848
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:45,039
replacement for peat moss that provides

1849
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,960
better benefits while being a

1850
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:50,319
sustainable choice

1851
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,480
pit moss sounds an axe like peat moss

1852
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:54,719
but instead of being mined from fragile

1853
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,119
ecosystems is actually made from

1854
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,118
upcycled organic paper and cardboard

1855
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,519
headed for landfills

1856
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,440
pit moss is excellent at retaining water

1857
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:05,440
in your substrate and creating air

1858
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,639
pockets and tiny living environments for

1859
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,519
microbes

1860
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:11,440
pit moss instantly increases aeration

1861
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:13,119
nutrient absorption and water

1862
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,679
conservation too

1863
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,599
carefully and locally sourced pit moss

1864
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:20,798
is the result of decades long research

1865
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:23,280
into the use of recycled paper fibers

1866
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:25,199
pit moss is lightweight and easy to use

1867
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,798

1997
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:08,000
uh

1998
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:09,519
with them so you know mostly what i

1999
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,198
understand about these parasitic

2000
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:16,239
nematodes is that they like to eat the

2001
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:18,639
roots and slow the growth of the plant

2002
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:19,839
and i also kind of get the idea that

2003
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,640
they are

2004
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,480
way more common um

2005
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,239
that

2006
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:28,879
than i think we we think they are

2007
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,158
because most people

2008
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,159
interpret what's happening with the

2009
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:34,479
plant as a nutrient problem

2010
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:37,039
so will you we go through these plant

2011
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:39,119
parasite nematodes and and kind of

2012
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:41,760
explain how they're they're working

2013
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:43,198
against us in the rhizosphere

2014
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,440
sure be glad too

2015
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:47,439
uh so plant parasitic nematodes are very

2016
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:49,678
common they're everywhere if you can

2017
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:51,839
look out a window and see some grass or

2018
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,600
or forest or trees there are plant

2019
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,520
parasitic nematodes feeding on those

2020
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,079
plants

2021
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,159
but in a in a kind of a balanced

2022
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,119
environment let's say a this undisturbed

2023
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:02,639
forest

2024
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,640
or even a

2025
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,760
long-term meadow they're all at balance

2026
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,000
they're not

2027
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,600
they're taking their little share

2028
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
of food but it's not enough to really

2029
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:16,239
hurt really damage anything

2030
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,960
it's when we go to uh monocultures

2031
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:20,158
high intensity agricultural production

2032
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,079
that we begin to see that these

2033
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:24,079
nematodes begin to dominate

2034
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,399
because we are removing

2035
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,920
uh a lot of the constraints

2036
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:29,439
that that

2037
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,399
that keep them down such as other

2038
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:35,198
parasites other predators uh

2039
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,719
the diseases of nematodes fungi that

2040
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:38,960
attack nematodes

2041
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,600
and and they become more predominant

2042
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:44,640
because we've altered that uh natural

2043
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,560
arrangement in in

2044
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,400
that has been developing for millions

2045
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,239
upon millions of years so plant

2046
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:52,960
parasitic nematodes are also called

2047
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:55,678
phytoparasitic or abbreviated we call

2048
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,480
them ppns because we get tired of saying

2049
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:01,279
plant parasitic nematodes um

2050
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:03,839
they they all have uh uh

2051
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:05,679
their mouth is tran my mouth is modified

2052
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,920
into a needle-like structure it looks

2053
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:10,319
just like a hypodermic needle actually

2054
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,679
uh that they use to puncture roots

2055
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:15,119
when they puncture roots they invent

2056
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:17,039
they inject enzymes that dissolve the

2057
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:18,559
contents of root cells

2058
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:20,319
then they suck that back out that's

2059
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,920
their food

2060
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,319
some nematodes just feed on the surface

2061
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,079
of roots these are not much consequence

2062
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:27,759
they're called ectoparasites because

2063
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:30,399
they're on the outside

2064
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,480
we also have endoparasites

2065
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,158
uh one group of endo parasites enters

2066
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,238
the roots and migrates around in the

2067
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:38,158
outer tissues the cortex

2068
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:40,799
just feeding as they go

2069
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:43,359
laying eggs in there and uh they're more

2070
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,199
important than the ectoparasites

2071
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,279
we also have the what are called the

2072
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:49,839
sedentary endoparasites these are

2073
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:52,000
nematodes that enter a root

2074
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,920
find a nice spot in the vascular tissue

2075
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,880
the xylem or the phloem

2076
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,279
establish a specialized feeding site

2077
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,840
by the by injection of various plant

2078
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,920
hormones or plant hormone analogs or

2079
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,239
they get the plant to do it

2080
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,840
they produce a specialized feeding cells

2081
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:09,198
and then they settle down they're

2082
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,800
protected from the environment because

2083
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,119
they're inside the root

2084
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,320
and can produce lots and lots of eggs

2085
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:16,000
those are the most important ones

2086
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:18,079
because they're directly taking

2087
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,479
photosynthated nutrients

2088
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:22,559
from the plant by their feeding

2089
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:24,079
so

2090
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,159
in nature let's say if i'm near the

2091
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:29,439
great smoky mountains if i go up in the

2092
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:30,559
smokies and sample around

2093
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:31,919
a tree

2094
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,760
i'm going to find all these kinds

2095
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,679
they're all there but they're not really

2096
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,679
high numbers because they're balanced

2097
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,760
out with everything else in the soil so

2098
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,880
this is a phenomenon we call solar

2099
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,560
stasis

2100
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,840
where everything is kind of checking

2101
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,480
everything else

2102
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,719
to make sure nobody gets out of control

2103
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:50,079
um and so it's when we when we begin to

2104
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,079
manipulate the environment we begin to

2105
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:54,079
see problems

2106
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:57,119
it would make sense to me that these

2107
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:58,479
plant parasitic nematodes or ppns are

2108
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,840
more common

2109
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:04,158
in monocultures or in um you know

2110
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,640
especially aggressive

2111
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:09,519
you know commercial environments because

2112
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:12,880
uh both of those varieties are

2113
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:15,840
intentionally trying to maximize growth

2114
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:18,239
by intentionally having the biosphere be

2115
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,960
out of balance right there's right it's

2116
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:22,879
solid it's solid host root is what it is

2117
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,600
and it's uh it's a perfect environment

2118
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:27,119
there's uh the more diverse a plant

2119
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,000
community is the less likely any

2120
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:32,840
nematode is to become dominant but in a

2121
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,198
monoculture uh the food is

2122
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:39,279
everywhere so um so so if we were to

2123
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:40,639
take the the opposite which would be

2124
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:42,479
either

2125
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,840
you know um

2126
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:46,319
living a

2127
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,159
living soil versus hydro meaning like

2128
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:49,920
you know so so not hydro but like a

2129
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,559
living soil commercial cannabis

2130
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:57,039
environment that that it might be beds

2131
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:59,679
or living soil pots or a a home grower

2132
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:01,760
or you know like a like an outdoor craft

2133
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,079
grower in california the one thing that

2134
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,480
all these people have in common

2135
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,559
is that they are all trying to keep

2136
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:11,279
their soil complex

2137
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,039
and the very act of trying to keep our

2138
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:15,519
soil complex

2139
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:17,920
sounds like it itself is the best

2140
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,560
defense against plant parasitic

2141
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,560
nematodes

2142
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,640
i guess i guess it means i guess i

2143
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:28,799
wonder what complex means uh

2144
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,400
a lot of uh amendments and things like

2145
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,920
that would definitely be helpful yeah

2146
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:36,319
yeah meaning you know lots of uh uh uh

2147
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:39,760
top dressing with mulches and compost

2148
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:42,399
tea right and um you know uh uh you know

2149
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,600
inoculant with uh mycelium to make sure

2150
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:45,198
that you've got a good fungal

2151
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,520
environment and

2152
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:49,919
you know all the things that uh folks

2153
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,920
who are doing their best to cause a

2154
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,560
thriving complex living soil to do which

2155
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,760
is

2156
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,719
what our you know variety of cultivator

2157
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,719
does

2158
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,640
for the plant right so it sounds like by

2159
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,719
taking trying to take care of the plant

2160
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:06,640
soil as best possible

2161
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:08,239
um we are also acting as a uh a natural

2162
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,760
defense mechanism against these

2163
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:12,158
parasites yeah there's a lot of good

2164
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,600
evidence out there for the use of uh

2165
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:16,158
composting

2166
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,600
soil amendments and rotations

2167
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:19,839
um

2168
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,400
that like i'm talking about rotation

2169
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,199
would be like a wheat soybean rotation

2170
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:26,719
in in one year that uh really do

2171
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:28,799
significantly reduce plant parasite

2172
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,158
nematodes i was thinking about that

2173
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:34,079
earlier because there's you know there's

2174
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:37,759
not really a lot of crop rotation in um

2175
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:40,800
cannabis either either in uh licensed or

2176
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:43,840
unlicensed because uh in the licensed

2177
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,760
environment um your space is so

2178
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,000
controlled by

2179
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,760
the the regulatory part of your license

2180
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,238
like where you're growing how much

2181
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:56,000
canopy you've got you know how much how

2182
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:59,678
much you can afford to fence right so so

2183
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,479
there's a lot more of you know repeated

2184
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:04,880
growing in the same location

2185
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:07,919
and uh similarly people use the same

2186
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,960
pots over and over again but but you

2187
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,079
know the reading i was doing in

2188
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,480
preparation you know the the the the

2189
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:16,559
three season crop rotation seemed to be

2190
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:19,519
like the number one suggestion for folks

2191
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:22,480
so that you you mix up the food sources

2192
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,080
to discourage these parasitic nematodes

2193
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,158
and and you know

2194
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:29,198
there seems to be this you know it could

2195
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,399
be suggested oh we should do that too

2196
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,639
but it really doesn't sound like

2197
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:35,359
parasitic nematodes are enough of a

2198
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:38,640
problem to justify that effort

2199
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:39,759
yeah the jury is out on that um

2200
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,440
the pro

2201
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,520
going historically i think you've seen

2202
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:44,879
the paper that or heard my presentation

2203
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,520
before

2204
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,039
when you go back

2205
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,120
with the

2206
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:54,000
regulation of cannabis so that really

2207
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:56,479
wasn't grown at all from the 1930s on

2208
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,359
this eliminated entire

2209
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:59,439
uh

2210
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:01,439
how many 60

2211
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:03,439
70 years of research

2212
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:04,960
then that's when nematology was really

2213
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:07,279
taking off

2214
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,760
so the first report the first report of

2215
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:11,519
planned parenthood nematodes was in on

2216
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,400
on hemp in

2217
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,400
the u.s was in 1935

2218
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:18,559
and right after that of course uh

2219
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:21,198
production was shut down except for you

2220
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:23,600
know wartime uh necessities things like

2221
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:25,359
that so nothing was done on it and

2222
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,960
consequently we don't have enough we

2223
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:27,599
don't have enough history yet working on

2224
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,359
it

2225
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,960
to know whether

2226
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:34,238
uh ppns are going to be uh a severe

2227
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,119
problem in

2228
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:37,839
um

2229
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:39,599
in production of cannabis

2230
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,279
we do know that there are some that will

2231
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,079
really attack it

2232
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:48,079
um based on some european research and

2233
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:50,479
some indian research but as far as here

2234
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:51,600
we don't know yet we the jury has to we

2235
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,479
have to say the jury's still a little

2236
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,719
bit out

2237
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:57,119
well if if that if that if that research

2238
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,920
uh still hasn't come to conclusion yet i

2239
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:02,719
know that this i'm about to ask you a uh

2240
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:05,359
you know an estimated guess question but

2241
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:09,198
but let's say that we do find that that

2242
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:10,960
um ppns are going to be an issue for us

2243
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,158
in cultivating cannabis

2244
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,279
um

2245
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:16,559
is there anything that you would

2246
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:19,119
recommend us to do to rid ourselves of

2247
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,760
these ppns other than just bring the

2248
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:24,800
soil back into balance is there is there

2249
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,800
an you know an organic solution to these

2250
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,119
parasitic nematodes or is it as simple

2251
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,920
as get your soil back into balance and

2252
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:33,679
the the ppns will just go away

2253
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,600
uh yeah that's uh

2254
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:37,440
they don't go away

2255
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,679
once once they're there let's say you

2256
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:41,519
say that you've introduced them into uh

2257
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,039
your field inadvertently or you just

2258
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,239
happen to find out that they're there

2259
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:46,960
they're there

2260
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:49,519
and uh it's extremely difficult to

2261
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:51,279
eliminate some of them if they have a if

2262
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,040
we had nematodes that let's say we're

2263
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:55,279
hemp specific and that's all they

2264
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:56,800
attacked that'd be easy

2265
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:58,639
you just um

2266
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,960
just not grow hemp on that area for a

2267
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,639
year or two that would eliminate it but

2268
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,359
unfortunately there's no evidence of

2269
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:07,760
anything specific to hemp the ones that

2270
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:08,719
do attack hamper all have broad host

2271
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,560
ranges

2272
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:13,198
and uh can survive just fine on the

2273
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,719
weeds and and uh anything else you're

2274
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:17,119
growing there

2275
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,719
so so they haven't targeted our cannabis

2276
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:20,238
we just got unlucky

2277
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,319
we don't know yet because we haven't

2278
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:25,599
been doing field surveys uh it's been so

2279
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:26,639
recently and there's only

2280
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,280
um

2281
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,520
only in alabama at auburn and north

2282
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:35,679
carolina state have they done any field

2283
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:38,320
examination at all we have been doing um

2284
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:41,119
we we have been doing greenhouse work to

2285
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:42,799
establish susceptibility and resistance

2286
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:44,479
west virginia has done west virginia

2287
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,600
university has done a little bit

2288
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,119
um

2289
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,120
anybody else in florida university of

2290
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:52,559
florida

2291
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:54,960
so um so again uh you listeners who are

2292
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,639
looking to get into living soil research

2293
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,520
here are more opportunities for you

2294
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:59,600
right

2295
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:02,400
to do this study well there's one thing

2296
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,159
i did want to mention um and it may

2297
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:05,920
sound

2298
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:08,000
i don't know how it sounds but one of

2299
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,840
the things that hemp growers could do if

2300
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,560
i'm assuming that eventually if not

2301
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,360
already there will be state associations

2302
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,679
of

2303
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:17,119
of cannabis producers and

2304
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,800
uh interested in protecting their

2305
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:20,399
markets and all that

2306
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,840
one thing that has done a lot for

2307
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:24,079
commodities

2308
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,400
uh especially the soybeans and cotton is

2309
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:28,639
to establish state commodity boards

2310
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:29,519
that assess a small amount to each

2311
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,840
grower

2312
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,120
of based on production

2313
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,760
and to provide that money back to

2314
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:36,960
researchers at uh

2315
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,199
at

2316
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,480
state or other uh legitimate

2317
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:42,638
universities

2318
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:45,039
and that's helpful too because um you

2319
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,480
know in the the in the legal outdoor

2320
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:48,319
world they're all

2321
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:50,559
growing in different biospheres right i

2322
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:52,799
mean the the the biosphere for growing

2323
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,800
outdoors where i live uh in the pacific

2324
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,719
northwest is incredibly different than

2325
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:59,039
that in california versus where you are

2326
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:01,520
in tennessee and so right that that kind

2327
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,679
of local research i think is really

2328
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,000
important especially with uh you know

2329
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:08,319
climate change and everybody's bioregion

2330
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,319
getting a little wonky and it's amazing

2331
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:11,679
how much research you can get done by

2332
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:12,880
giving a researcher a little bit of

2333
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,279
money all he wants to feel this little

2334
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:17,199
gratitude that's all

2335
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:19,679
so um i've got a couple uh kind of

2336
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:21,519
non-sequitur questions for you sure so

2337
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:24,079
um uh it kept on coming up in the

2338
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:26,320
literature that um that you can plant

2339
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:28,840
marigolds and let them go year round

2340
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:31,679
without cutting them to limit um

2341
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:35,360
nematodes um what's going on there why

2342
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:37,760
why why do marigolds limit the the

2343
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:39,519
nematodes marigold roots produce a

2344
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,280
substance called patulin

2345
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,440
that is um

2346
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:45,198
that's toxic to nematodes

2347
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:46,879
and reduces and

2348
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:48,960
i'll actually kill them i believe will

2349
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,719
it get rid of our beneficial nematodes

2350
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,319
as well as the parasitic or is it mostly

2351
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:54,319
about the parasitic because they're

2352
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:57,920
eating those that's that's another good

2353
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:59,759
question i'd say that uh

2354
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,440
yes it's probably just the plant pair

2355
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,600
since parasites trying to feed on

2356
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:05,839
marigold roots but i believe it does

2357
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,079
leach out in the soil so

2358
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,159
so i don't know the answer to that but i

2359
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:12,639
do know that and we have touted this in

2360
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:14,399
the past in tennessee too for home

2361
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,840
homeowners you know small vegetable

2362
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:18,238
patches where they get a lot of root not

2363
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,279
nematode um to

2364
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,158
to

2365
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:22,238
grow

2366
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:23,759
grow marigolds for a year it might be

2367
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:25,198
hard to convince people that broadcast

2368
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,280
you know have a big feel of marigolds

2369
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:28,960
but it would be kind of pretty and i

2370
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:30,000
kind of like marigolds i like the way

2371
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,000
they smell

2372
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,039
and their marigolds are really popular

2373
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,439
in um in regenerative cannabis in fact

2374
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:40,238
uh many people will actually

2375
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:43,279
grow marigolds and and other similar uh

2376
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:46,158
ornamentals as banker or trap plants for

2377
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:48,960
beneficial uh insects and then have

2378
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:51,759
those near the main body uh oh and you

2379
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:54,239
know co-planted with with cannabis those

2380
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,760
are all good approaches yes yeah so uh

2381
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,959
another question for you is that um

2382
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,880
there is a paper from 1997 that john

2383
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,960
mcpartlin put out that's pretty

2384
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,840
popular in the regenerative cannabis

2385
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:08,960
scene and he suggests that that you can

2386
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,800
take a mature cannabis plant and mash it

2387
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:13,920
up with a solvent like water or

2388
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:16,800
something and then and then strain out

2389
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,960
the the plant material and then and then

2390
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:24,880
use that um

2391
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:27,920
water enriched with um with cannabis um

2392
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:31,039
you know essential botan botanicals uh

2393
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,039
as a foliar and a root drench which will

2394
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:34,719
discourage nematodes now one of the

2395
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,880
things that frustrates a lot of us about

2396
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:38,960
that paper is that it doesn't say like

2397
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,359
where in the cannabis life and if

2398
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:45,198
there's only certain parts of the plant

2399
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:47,198
and uh or what the active uh ingredient

2400
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,359
might be so we're pretty limited in that

2401
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:51,198
but i was wondering if that uh you know

2402
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:53,359
did that did that tickle your brain in

2403
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:56,719
any place where that makes sense to you

2404
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:59,439
that that you know parts of the

2405
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:01,439
uh the resin or maybe even the plant

2406
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:04,399
material of the cannabis plant itself

2407
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:08,079
might be a discouragement to nematodes i

2408
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:09,519
don't recall john's paper offhand but uh

2409
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:11,519
a lot of this research has been done

2410
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,280
mostly in india where they've used

2411
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,560
different extracts of

2412
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:19,039
of leaves or roots or the whole plant

2413
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,120
and then applied it to in experimental

2414
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:22,719
conditions to see

2415
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,479
whether it uh

2416
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,399
whether it kills nematodes or causes

2417
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:27,678
them to become immobilized or has some

2418
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:31,279
negative effect

2419
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:33,920
um i'm not aware that i'm not sure

2420
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:34,800
how spraying on the leaves would help

2421
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,239
but

2422
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,440
but using as a root drench

2423
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:41,759
uh

2424
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:44,158
seems to have some effect i'm i'm just

2425
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,280
thinking off you know thinking back to

2426
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:47,039
the the

2427
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:48,559
indian papers i've read which is where

2428
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:49,760
this research has been done

2429
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,360
and um

2430
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,039
it makes sense to me and the results i

2431
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:54,880
saw in the papers looked like yeah that

2432
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:58,000
works the other thing that can be done

2433
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,600
though is is simply uh

2434
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,479
once the

2435
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,560
once

2436
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:05,839
they've been harvested

2437
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:08,639
and again i'm i'm in the nematode

2438
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,319
uh infection business so i'm not even

2439
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,560
all that familiar with how hemp is

2440
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,559
harvested is it cut and then

2441
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,159
hung to dry and then our the flowers are

2442
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,039
harvested correct

2443
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:18,000
okay

2444
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:19,760
well

2445
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,198
you only use the flowers

2446
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,840
take the rest of that material and plow

2447
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:25,439
it back into the soil

2448
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,480
this works for a lot of different crops

2449
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:27,839
just

2450
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:29,919
even just for the sake of adding more

2451
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:32,239
organic matter but i believe there are

2452
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:35,440
there are substances in the leaves and

2453
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:38,079
stems that probably that have some kind

2454
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:40,638
of effect and also there are there are

2455
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:43,359
uh smaller varieties of trichomes on

2456
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:46,000
many of the stems that that contain the

2457
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:48,079
same resins as the flowers and and you

2458
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,198
know we know that does all sorts of ant

2459
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:52,559
antifungal antibacteria oh yeah

2460
01:28:50,198 --> 01:28:54,319
anti-inflammation so uh that wouldn't

2461
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:58,000
surprise me if that those were playing a

2462
01:28:54,319 --> 01:29:00,559
role as well and you know with the

2463
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,439
natural farming is is really popular and

2464
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,679
increasing in popularity in cannabis and

2465
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:08,319
and specifically the variety known as

2466
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:11,199
korean natural farming and one of the

2467
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:13,359
one of the applications of of this

2468
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:14,238
system that we're talking about is that

2469
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:16,158
um

2470
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:18,238
regenerative farmers are taking the

2471
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:21,839
plant material and they're making a

2472
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:24,399
fermented plant juice by by taking equal

2473
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,119
parts plant matter and sugar

2474
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:28,479
and

2475
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:30,479
in a closed jar and then just letting

2476
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:34,079
the plant material break down in the

2477
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:38,158
sugar the sugars um then create like an

2478
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:41,519
incubation an incubation environment for

2479
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:43,279
those uh key botanicals and then uh you

2480
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:47,840
know you you spray it at like you know

2481
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:50,880
uh one five hundred uh uh both foliarly

2482
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,719
um and then as a root drench and so it's

2483
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:55,359
it's the same kind of experience but

2484
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:57,119
makes it more shelf stable

2485
01:29:55,359 --> 01:30:00,000
well maybe that uh maybe that helps

2486
01:29:57,119 --> 01:30:01,198
deter uh foliar pathogens too

2487
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,880
um

2488
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:05,198
again i'm not really familiar with that

2489
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,480
approach that sounds like uh the kind of

2490
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:07,759
um

2491
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:09,519
kind of experiments that citizen

2492
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,039
scientists do yeah it's just trying

2493
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,840
things out i mean

2494
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:15,600
and that's fine i it would it would be

2495
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,760
really good to formalize some of those

2496
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,120
things and actually try them

2497
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,719
in experimental conditions where they

2498
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:23,439
can be where they can be sure they're

2499
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:25,119
working um

2500
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:26,960
it may work great

2501
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:28,880
so we've already don't know we've

2502
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,198
already established that um you know as

2503
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,679
long as we keep our uh our soil in

2504
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:34,559
balance we don't you know the likelihood

2505
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:38,800
that we're gonna have a problem with

2506
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:41,039
parasitic nematodes is low however um uh

2507
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,039
the the literature uh has mentioned a

2508
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:46,639
few times uh

2509
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:49,600
this this uh essentially taking chitin

2510
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:50,800
and uh turning it into a powder um into

2511
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,719
something that looks like it's

2512
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,920
pronounced uh cheetah son

2513
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,800
and and

2514
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,639
kaido kind of sand thank you

2515
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,360
and um because

2516
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:04,319
supposedly the the nematodes do not like

2517
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:06,479
rubbing against it because it's scratchy

2518
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:09,679
for them is is this something that you

2519
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:12,479
see deployed um

2520
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:15,440
i've not i've not heard that reason um

2521
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:17,759
for why nematodes don't like it but

2522
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:20,000
but what we think is going on is that

2523
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:24,480
chitin is a good food source for certain

2524
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,960
fungi that that attack nematodes

2525
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,879
and they will colonize that chitin

2526
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,800
and supposedly

2527
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,800
here's the reason why

2528
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,760
the number the fungi live in soil there

2529
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,920
are tr

2530
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,320
nematode trapping fungi

2531
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:39,520
uh nematodes with sticky spores and all

2532
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:41,439
this

2533
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,600
they're at pretty low levels most of the

2534
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:44,960
time because where we have the soil

2535
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,560
stasis where everything just kind of

2536
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,679
stays where it's supposed to be

2537
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,400
you add chitin and this is a good is a

2538
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:53,359
good food source for these

2539
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:55,359
uh

2540
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:56,399
these these fungi

2541
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:57,759
um

2542
01:31:56,399 --> 01:31:59,679
and so they will

2543
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,840
colonize that and their numbers will

2544
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:04,399
increase the nematode gets comes along

2545
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,400
gets caught

2546
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,119
and so that's the idea behind doing it

2547
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,880
it does work um

2548
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:14,559
i i don't know of a whole lot of recent

2549
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:16,239
research it was a big flurry of this

2550
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,840
back in the 1890s

2551
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:21,279
because uh

2552
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:23,840
uh producers of uh shrimp products

2553
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:25,359
were overwhelmed by giant piles of of

2554
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,199
shrimp shells

2555
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:29,599
what are we gonna do with this material

2556
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:31,119
so grind it up because it's all chitin

2557
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,840
mix it into the soil and see what it

2558
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:36,079
does it does reduce nematode numbers the

2559
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,600
amount that and it may be that this

2560
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:40,559
process has become really refined but

2561
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:43,280
the amounts back then per acre were

2562
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,320
like six to eight tons per acre to see

2563
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,479
an effect

2564
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:48,559
but putting in that against nematodes

2565
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:51,439
but putting that amount also sometimes

2566
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,960
led to phytotoxicity

2567
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:54,399
now there may be more recent research

2568
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,399
that gets around that but that's my

2569
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:57,839
current understanding it's interesting

2570
01:32:56,399 --> 01:32:59,599
too i think like this this kind of

2571
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,400
illustrates the difference between

2572
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,719
sometimes like like there's there is

2573
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:06,799
established science and then there's

2574
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:08,279
what we call in cannabis bro science

2575
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,000
which essentially myth and

2576
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:11,679
unsubstantiated rumor that we learned

2577
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,238
from our mentor right

2578
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:16,639
and and our entire scene is going

2579
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:18,638
through a replacement of bro science

2580
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:21,600
which which for most of us we're very

2581
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:23,520
emotionally connected to me as well but

2582
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,960
but as we get more educated we learn

2583
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,080
that some of the things we've learned

2584
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:30,800
from our mentors or or forums or

2585
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:32,960
magazines when during the prohibition

2586
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,719
era um that it's it's you know it

2587
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,520
doesn't it doesn't hold up to science

2588
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:40,800
and and and where where i learned about

2589
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:43,199
you know the idea that the the chitin um

2590
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,600
you know you know scraped the nematodes

2591
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:48,158
on the outside was was a forums a forum

2592
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:51,199
for this and they were comparing it to

2593
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:54,399
diatomaceous earth which which is used

2594
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:56,559
for that right so that uh for example um

2595
01:33:54,399 --> 01:33:59,679
you put diatomaceous earth around your

2596
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:01,920
plant and it will uh discourage slugs

2597
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:04,399
because they don't like to crawl across

2598
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,359
it right and so so

2599
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:08,158
it's funny because you know that being

2600
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:10,799
the

2601
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:12,000
you know the reason i gave before to use

2602
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,679
it got a chuckle out of you and then you

2603
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,840
went ahead and explained the actual

2604
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:18,239
science which is you know

2605
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,279
feed feed the parasitic nematode

2606
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:21,359
predator

2607
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:23,279
which is which is you know

2608
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:24,639
an entire totally different de pro

2609
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,639
approach but actually makes a whole lot

2610
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,880
more scientific sense

2611
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,199
well the flip side of um

2612
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,920
let's say traditional approaches

2613
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:36,238
uh they um

2614
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,158
that have been used for so many years is

2615
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:41,519
that uh a lot of those are going to have

2616
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:44,559
threads of real threads of value in them

2617
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,800
and uh that making that connection

2618
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:49,280
in the various states getting scientists

2619
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,880
to hear about these things uh can

2620
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:52,719
promote some useful

2621
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,960
useful research i mean they're

2622
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:56,000
there are probably there i'm sure there

2623
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,118
are many

2624
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,960
long-time

2625
01:34:57,118 --> 01:35:01,118
cannabis growers who

2626
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:04,158
who grow beautiful cannabis

2627
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:04,880
they just have the knack or the feel for

2628
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:07,679
it

2629
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,560
um we have we had a person working here

2630
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:09,840
for us

2631
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,920
at the university of tennessee in our

2632
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:13,119
greenhouse who i

2633
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,560
who

2634
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:15,679
one time i just said she's a hemp

2635
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,360
whisperer

2636
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,560
because she knew

2637
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:20,559
just seemed to know instinctual

2638
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:23,039
instinctively how to grow beautiful tall

2639
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:25,440
hemp she grew ham 10 feet tall in the

2640
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:26,719
greenhouse

2641
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:28,559
couldn't treat it for insects a way to

2642
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:29,359
get rid of it but i mean she was really

2643
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,039
good

2644
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:32,639
and um

2645
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:35,279
and it wasn't that she went through a

2646
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:37,118
long course of study she just had a feel

2647
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:39,599
for it

2648
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:41,039
um it it is interesting you know you

2649
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,560
know i think that i think that humans

2650
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:45,519
have recognized that for years but

2651
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:47,440
people having a green thumb right and um

2652
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:49,440
and uh you know you can you can get to

2653
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:51,599
that skill by education or good

2654
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:53,678
mentoring but some people just seem to

2655
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,800
have the natural vibration for it

2656
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:59,760
and uh and and i consider them to i

2657
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:02,320
consider that a talent too so so uh

2658
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,679
let's finish off with this um uh kind of

2659
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:06,079
an odd question

2660
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:07,920
uh so so you know

2661
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:10,399
can these nematodes can any of the

2662
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:14,000
nematodes that we're gonna find around

2663
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:16,158
our cannabis cause us harm so so you

2664
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,158
know the literature talks about hookworm

2665
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:20,879
roundworm whipworm these different

2666
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:24,879
nematodes that can you know actually get

2667
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:26,880
into the human body and cause us grief

2668
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:30,400
and you know the

2669
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,480
our our our soils you know both outdoors

2670
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:34,960
and in the pots are filled with such

2671
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:38,000
variety of species

2672
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:40,158
just like we have to be careful with

2673
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,158
splashing

2674
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:44,559
our soil while we're watering our plants

2675
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:48,719
because we don't want it necessarily to

2676
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:50,320
splash to an adjoining container

2677
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:53,760
do we need to be aware of the

2678
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:55,840
possibility of giving a nematode access

2679
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,400
to our human while we're working with

2680
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:00,319
soil because most of us work ungloved

2681
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:02,799
pretty intimately with the soil yeah me

2682
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:02,799
too yeah

2683
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,600
the

2684
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:08,960
the chances are are extremely remote

2685
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,480
the only one you mentioned that i would

2686
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,239
be concerned with in this country would

2687
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:13,919
be hookworm

2688
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:15,599
and hookworm you're going to have only

2689
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,480
if you have uh

2690
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:20,480
if you have pets especially dogs around

2691
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:21,759
that are defecating

2692
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:24,158
on the grounds

2693
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,960
and you're stepping in it

2694
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:26,638
that's

2695
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,239
that's uh

2696
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,719
you know there was a it was a major

2697
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:32,399
problem in the south over a century ago

2698
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:33,760
and i we lectured quite a bit of that in

2699
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:34,879
my class on

2700
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,719
hookworm

2701
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,960
and and and how it was eventually

2702
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:41,760
brought in control

2703
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:44,158
but as far as these other parasites go

2704
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,880
unless you are handling soil

2705
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:49,198
that has the eggs of the nematode and

2706
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:52,079
then putting your hands in your mouth

2707
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:54,638
you are highly highly unlikely to get an

2708
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:56,880
infection the way you avoid

2709
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:58,319
intestinal roundworms is to make sure

2710
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,480
that you are buying produce that's

2711
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:02,000
thoroughly cleaned but in this country

2712
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:04,319
we don't have much of a problem we do

2713
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,560
see infections um

2714
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:08,799
sometimes around

2715
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,880
where there are there's animal waste

2716
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,159
flowing down into a field

2717
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:16,079
occasionally out of other countries

2718
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:18,399
but people who are resident of those

2719
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:20,158
countries uh sometimes have really

2720
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:21,439
serious infections here

2721
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:24,479
uh no

2722
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:26,000
but if anyone ever starts getting severe

2723
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:27,919
intestinal pains they should see their

2724
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,039
doctor right away yeah because it does

2725
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,840
exist so it sounds like uh you know

2726
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:36,560
keep your keep your grow area clean

2727
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,480
uh uh wash your hands and keep your

2728
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,560
hands out of your mouth you heathen yeah

2729
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:42,559
there you go that's exactly right that's

2730
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,400
exactly right and i've handled i've

2731
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,639
handled soil all my life my bare hands

2732
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:48,479
uh i wear gloves only if it's

2733
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:49,279
there's something i'm mixing up and that

2734
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:51,039
never

2735
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:52,559
as far as i know i don't have a problem

2736
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:54,479
right on

2737
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,400
well well dr bernard thank you so much

2738
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:59,118
for taking your time out of your very

2739
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:01,839
busy schedule to hang out with us you

2740
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:04,719
know it's um i i said in the

2741
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:07,880
introduction to the show that um it was

2742
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:11,920
it was very challenging to find a

2743
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:14,159
nematologist who was um well a i could

2744
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:17,199
even i could even make contact with but

2745
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:19,359
who was also open and interested in

2746
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:20,879
speaking about cannabis because there

2747
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:22,559
was this kind of like general idea that

2748
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,960
there's just not a lot of the research

2749
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:27,520
has been done yet and and i really

2750
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:29,520
appreciate that you you chose to step up

2751
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:32,080
to the plate and say all right there's

2752
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,320
there's all these gaps and what we know

2753
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:36,719
but i do know nematodes and so i will

2754
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,719
give it the best shot so so i appreciate

2755
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:41,679
