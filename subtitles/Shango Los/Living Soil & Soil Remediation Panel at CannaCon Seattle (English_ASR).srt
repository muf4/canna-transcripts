1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,100
thank you for being here everyone and

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:09,960
welcome to the eleven ten living the

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:12,058
soils channel the length of the Pam's

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,700
gonna be starting down and running about

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:19,649
fifty minutes till noon we're gonna do

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:21,809
about 40 45 minutes of a conversation

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,159
and then altering our guest speakers

8
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:24,929
we're very excited to take your question

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,140
so then we'll switch over and do 10-15

10
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:30,239
minutes of questions from you for those

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,739
of you who are new to probiotic

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,988
including soil and computer as beginner

13
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:40,159
building the soil with active microbe

14
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:43,709
life is is the progression of growing

15
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,750
versus what were used to experience

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,549
during the early provision into our days

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,509
where soil will might as well then

18
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:53,578
styrofoam super packet with nutrients

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,890
this new idea to talk about today

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,230
considers the soil as a living

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,878
participant and our goal is to foster

22
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:04,338
microorganism community

23
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,978
within your soil to of a plant so that

24
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:09,798
makes us as much soil armors as tanks

25
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:14,420
burners so first let's welcome our guest

26
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:17,840
from from the side with services and

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,820
acclaim and is a biologist partner and

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,710
co-author of several program and

29
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:24,469
regenerative agriculture books including

30
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:27,019
the hidden half of nature the microbial

31
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:29,420
roots of light had helped and also right

32
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:31,609
after this presentation she will be at

33
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,710
the manic microbes book of the booth

34
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:35,659
doing a book signing if you'd like to

35
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:40,009
meet her and get a copy of your website

36
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:42,710
to her left is about how does the

37
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:45,228
co-founder and co inventor and cheap

38
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:47,719
growth officer and procession but you

39
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:50,599
probably weren't familiar with them as a

40
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,810
modern microbes and the fabulous product

41
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,419
mammoth P he'll receive his PhD in

42
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,379
biological sciences specializing in soil

43
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,649
microbial ecology and plant microbe

44
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:04,689
actions and to his left cat jack

45
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,760

podcast if you enjoy hearing experts

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,870
like this talking about their particular

56
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,060
region of Kansas I encourage you to

57
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,879
check out my podcast at shaping fighter

58
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,370
calm there is a postcard or even in your

59
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:49,180
convention back so we're going to get

60
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:50,259
started right in let's see here so so in

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,510
let me start with you since you're on

62
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:55,090
the side so Vanessa so historically

63
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:57,009
cannabis growers have been taught to to

64
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,210
pack their candidacies soil with

65
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:02,889
isolated nutrients then all nutrients

66
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,599
that the plant needs but they're not

67
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:07,149
necessarily participating with each

68
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,819
other what is a method that you find

69
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,340
successful to transition towards waking

70
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,949
up the soil to alive more on the micro

71
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,330
communities as a whole instead of

72
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:22,959
individual sublights

73
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:26,500
I think for each thing I think about

74
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:33,010
said once once you realize that the soil

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:35,879
is really about not only physics and

76
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:40,090
chemistry but the missing link and

77
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:43,990
soiled it was really really started to

78
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,930
embrace and study and integrate into

79
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,870
growing practices instant biology

80
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,689
because in many ways it's the biology

81
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,430
that makes the physics the chemistry and

82
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:57,449
the movement of things in the soil

83
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,520
nutrients minerals and things like that

84
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:04,329
move from the soil into the green body

85
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,060
on the plant and normally when I talk

86
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,100
site I have this this particular slide

87
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,379
that I really like it was every time at

88
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:14,469
Ivan get it like I could just sort of

89
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:18,879
sort of sink into the world of soil and

90
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:21,699
a very unique area in soil that is

91
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,699
nanometers to millimeters right around

92
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:28,750
every single root and that space is

93
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:31,870
called the rhizosphere and the recipe is

94
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,509
a wire and a line clips that all of us

95
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,090
need to know about and we need to know

96
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,879
what

97
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:42,299
so I was taking that word part of it for

98
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,719
folks oh right so means River spear of

99
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,540
course is about it's an area of about

100
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,790
the root and it is in the rise

101
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,139
experiment what you really have is a

102
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:57,169
biological Azhar Vaz in our so in your

103
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,400
mind so you conjure up you know

104
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:01,198
somewhere in a minute easy you've got

105
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,569
these traders that are coming in with

106
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,759
where's that none of the other traders

107
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:10,079
have and so you have this constant

108
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,199
ceaseless back-and-forth train stuff but

109
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,349
what microbial communities are training

110
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:21,240
is really pretty mindfully

111
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:23,699
they are producing metabolites from what

112
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,389
they're consuming for energy and some of

113
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:30,840
these metabolites have medicinal effects

114
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:34,829
on plants Summa tablets function that

115
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:37,769
has growth hormones so let's think about

116
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:42,569
this community you have one sector of

117
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:43,769
life microbial and it's making what we

118
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:47,339
in our two-minute world would call

119
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:50,659
products and they are supplying those

120
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:54,179
products to degree bodies of plants and

121
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:58,200
what plants doing plants have their own

122
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:03,449
wares unique to them that may trade back

123
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:12,659
and its different sorts of nutrients for

124
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:13,439
hybrids or amino acids fats and proteins

125
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,169
parameters

126
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:19,370
yeah that's it so it's just starting to

127
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:21,109
lost their biological azar from it

128
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,329
so this is what we need to think about

129
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,629
when we think about soil and when you

130
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:29,899
think about whatever kind of plan you're

131
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,790
growing that this is what you're this is

132
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:34,189
really what you're defeating is you're

133
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:42,889
eating the Spanish that are bringing

134
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:44,629
their wares to biopic about why were

135
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,340
using synthetic nutrients and why that

136
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,379
is go into there why we think about is

137
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,839
microbial some occasional microbiology

138
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,500
of isn't minute five interactions in the

139
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,689
rhizosphere

140
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,790
and how microbes interact within the

141
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:57,790
plant process here

142
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,069
and there's a huge problem farmers face

143
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,290
- the chemical

144
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:04,769
although they're very intuitive we could

145
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,740
easily tie how and you can't fertilizers

146
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:09,289
are similan and

147
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,019
as elation to be implanted precision in

148
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,870
agriculture any campus blunder totally

149
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,189
get that the microbiology is less

150
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,350
intuitive and it takes more of a

151
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:22,069
learning curve but it's critical we see

152
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,290
in agriculture how farmers have been

153
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,230
trained to plus and that in fertilizers

154
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,600
for years and decades and what we see is

155
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,100
a decline in soil health that's very

156
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,350
very interesting because the Nexen

157
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,320
declines the biology in those schools to

158
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:39,650
facilitate you cycling so the microbes

159
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,439
can actually help liberate nutrient

160
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:45,709
timing and biomedical implants microbes

161
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,649
are critical delivering maximize 100 all

162
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:51,739
introduced efficiency in precision

163
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:53,719
agriculture canvas farming we want to

164
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,210
maximize the precision this is a

165
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,130
precision farming industry and to do

166
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:01,159
that we want to incorporate all our

167
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:04,219
inputs into the plant and we're going to

168
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,470
do that not only maximizing our

169
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,100
understanding applications of fertilizer

170
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:13,130
use but with incorporating biology and

171
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,830
microbiology to help with that we can't

172
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:19,100
accomplish that without incorporating

173
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:23,089
microbes which as they do in nature in

174
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,389
our Rose cycle nutrients to maximize the

175
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:26,158
bioavailability

176
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,379
of any nutrient that we add into our

177
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:32,968
substrate so the plants that say to them

178
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:35,190
I think they covered it really what I

179
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,740
would have is just to simplify the

180
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,360
process a little bit we put out organic

181
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,120
fertilizer or any organic all the

182
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,408
nutrients we have to keep in mind

183
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,299
more or less we're not directly feeding

184
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:48,208
that planet we're feeding as microbial

185
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:50,879
communities as a way scientist engineers

186
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,528
to support the way to take up so it's

187
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,059
important to keep that in mind and then

188
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:56,070
the only thing I like to consider is

189
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,750
just how valuable the processes to the

190
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,730
plant in the sense that it's

191
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,649
photosynthesize involved is like turning

192
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,110
and imaging and putting it back out to

193
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,179
the roots I think the statistic Irina's

194
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,060
up to 60% of certain plants that was

195
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,750
back out in the form of exudates the

196
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:12,549
sugar

197
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,179
proteins to directly feeding the

198
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:15,179
bacteria

199
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,300
and there's so much that we still don't

200
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:23,220
know about soil and you know what's

201
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:26,219
going on under our feet in terms of this

202
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,200
interaction that it almost feels

203
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,840
arrogant to me to think that we can come

204
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,770
up with us and that I program

205
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,940
even close we get from a healthy

206
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:38,699
biological process when nature is doing

207
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,920
what it does and I'm just and I was

208
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,259
saying what my favorite quotes is from a

209
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,089
good friend of mine Jeff long because he

210
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:46,909
always likes to say there's no one

211
00:09:45,090 --> 00:10:07,410
fitting miracle-gro

212
00:09:46,909 --> 00:10:09,779
this beautiful fantastic nature

213
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:11,850
depending on my cruel associations just

214
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,679
like tap and we're talking about

215
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,379
and for us the thing that we can avoid

216
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,019
that to maximize the health and develop

217
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,179
it quality meal or plant agriculture is

218
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,699
naive and I think understanding cutting

219
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,409
integrate those is a really important

220
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,780
next step for us to revolutionize

221
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:31,379
agriculture and and merge that with

222
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:33,889
biology to do so with this next question

223
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:36,139
when you start packing area tab

224
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:37,939
so so how they are growing in native

225
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,370
soil is has become increasingly popular

226
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,620
to the candidates normalizations we can

227
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,440
go outside alright so what is the

228
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,840
regenerative practice retired native

229
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,050
soils that how our cannabis growers can

230
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,430
use to rejuvenate local soils instead of

231
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:57,409
merely shipping in soils from elsewhere

232
00:10:54,429 --> 00:11:00,829
yes so I'm a firm believer in Jesus was

233
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:02,809
it's what happens from a cultural

234
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,460
perspective farmers are bringing some of

235
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:06,500
those constantly there's no reason as an

236
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,629
annex partner we need to be any

237
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,610
different with our crops in terms of

238
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:12,860
that for me that touches or on soil

239
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,930
testing so we have this microbial side

240
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,460
of things where we have the biologic

241
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,169
cycling the nutrients make it available

242
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,330
but on the other end we need to look at

243
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:22,759
what's actually in that soil and giving

244
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,050
a soil test and analyzing

245
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,419
and what sorts of excesses and

246
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:28,149
efficiency means we may have an anatomy

247
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,979
of proper amounts of nutrients

248
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,419
micronutrients to balance that out it

249
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,180
was a long way and that's essentially

250
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:38,328
what conventional farming has been for a

251
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:41,269
long time so tying that aspect of soil

252
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:44,149
testing in farming with the microbial

253
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,169
side that I think is the future of

254
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:50,309
Agriculture

255
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:52,679
I think that's right - I want to

256
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:55,559
emphasize it I think we should think

257
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,939
about plants and being the foundation of

258
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,828
all life on Earth those primary

259
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,740
producers and everything else eats those

260
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:04,409
plants or eat things that eat plants and

261
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,019
plants that exists the best one and so

262
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:08,759
with that public school is actually the

263
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,039
foundation of all life because you can't

264
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,809
really grow plant about substrate or

265
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,059
dissin nutrients in that substrate or

266
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:17,638
soil and we also have to understand that

267
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:20,069
carbon is the currency of all life on

268
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,589
Earth and is definitely currency of soil

269
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,440
health and so making sure that you can

270
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:28,350
charge your soil with appropriate carbon

271
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,510
allows you to maintain this foundation

272
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,180
where you can having other ions that can

273
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,850
persist in as well

274
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:37,799
well if you look at soil health is

275
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,360
completely correlated with her that's

276
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,299
going to help sustain out on my career

277
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,629
eleven microbes are part of all black is

278
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:48,299
carbon-based and just the structure and

279
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:50,639
dead material carbon related material

280
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,189
they can hold on to the nutrients that

281
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,080
maximize cation exchange capacity in the

282
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,020
nutrient capacity that you're planting

283
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,879
girls again and happiness if you have a

284
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,159
very healthy soil you have a permit rich

285
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,559
soil that's full nutrients and they

286
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,269
become a microbial population that helps

287
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,009
cycle those nutrients naturally to make

288
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:11,879
human bioavailable form so your plants

289
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:15,480
can take them out I really like what you

290
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,820
said Shango about them or noticed at the

291
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:23,990
Miracle Grow the red one course for yes

292
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,990
with general but here's the deal

293
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:40,319
the foundation of our health was our

294
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:42,570
respective micro miles and so all this

295
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,020
stuff they call it have been talking

296
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:50,730
about is hardest new emerging and

297
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:52,679
merging area of science about the not

298
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,680
just these single microbes but the

299
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,449
microbial communities how it is that

300
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,029
they are interacting with one another

301
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,830
and how else they're interacting with

302
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:05,459
their host whether that's a person or a

303
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:08,700
planet and the more we learn about micro

304
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,160
biomes the more we are seeing how

305
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,670
critical they are or the health and

306
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:19,079
well-being of the plant host or the

307
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:20,579
person and so shameless question what

308
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,670
are some of your favorite you know

309
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:30,420
methods for regenerating sort of

310
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:33,899
presented soils so I I come at this as a

311
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:37,500
person who live here at sea on and built

312
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,449
a garden about 15 years ago and I will

313
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,159
tell you this tell you what very

314
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,920
embarrassing moments that myself as a

315
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,370
biologist and my husband as a geologist

316
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:50,699
and its really great to know about soil

317
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,759
you can laugh now we Bobby really test

318
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,460
our soil as we went about building this

319
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,370
garden so here we are with hot August

320
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,530
day dozens of plants and pots that have

321
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,570
been screening every four months to get

322
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,019
them out

323
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,700
into the ground and we're doing a talk

324
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,559
on Saturday so you can see the cracks

325
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,400
were we had it was lighter color than

326
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:16,219
the wall in this room and what my gut

327
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,399
told me was we never artists um and I

328
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:22,040
knew I needed that organic matter and I

329
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,399
said the problem of the soil that I can

330
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,789
see with my eye is lack of organic

331
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,909
matter

332
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:32,240
things are starving and malnourished in

333
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:33,949
this soil so I went into panic mode for

334
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,190
someone into panic mode and then I got a

335
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,200
really busy I got busy rounding up free

336
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,540
and inexpensive sources of organic

337
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,460
matter than my wheelbarrow painted with

338
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:47,599
flames which I'm actually not gonna

339
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,639
repaint with my gross and I loaded up

340
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,730
all kinds of organic matter from the

341
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:56,000
neighbors of leaves to coffee grounds

342
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,860
from the coffee shop to I made friends

343
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,259
with artists in the neighborhood to give

344
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,550
their woodchips and what I was

345
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,519
essentially doing is collecting

346
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:06,620
different sources of organic matter and

347
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,559
I would create lunches

348
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,560
I call these meals of mulches for my

349
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:15,709
microbial populations and how to layer

350
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,559
its on the soil and I would tell you

351
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:21,860
this there is no need to be digging all

352
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,469
of this organic matter into your soil is

353
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,560
really disruptive and disturbing to all

354
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,950
of these tiny tiny creatures that make

355
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:33,289
up the soil microbiome and after about

356
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:38,329
five years we went from soil is

357
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:43,189
that wall to something that is a dark

358
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:45,169
chocolatey color and what this led my

359
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,920
husband David and I to realize is that

360
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:53,120
in pretty short order you can restore

361
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:55,610
life to the soil and you can do it

362
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,039
faster than mother nature can do it and

363
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,740
what we were basically mimicking is

364
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,110
everything that happens in a forest I

365
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,269
mean plants have long long figured out

366
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,568
why do you think leaves fall off

367
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:11,179
deciduous trees and happen to land right

368
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:13,188
on top of the roots so I was thinking

369
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:15,290
about feeding the soil a little bit like

370
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,650
feeding they're eating our dog and that

371
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:21,980
is that put the food out and life will

372
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:25,280
come to the food and so that's that's

373
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:28,039
how I think about regenerating roses

374
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,109
I've done it and it did not take you

375
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:34,700
know a century or two if you take Mother

376
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:39,529
Asia to do just to get life into the

377
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,870
soil so in some ways you know I love to

378
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,369
vary from soil initially and I sort of

379
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:45,289
thought oh my god and that's kind of

380
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,279
like mine reclamation it's like their

381
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:48,619
them and that's what it looked like

382
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,839
we're dealing with your mother in from

383
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:53,389
Seattle together we've got glacial till

384
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:58,329
there's just not much on top of that so

385
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,330
we build soil from the top and then

386
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:08,419
anyway that's right it's very exciting

387
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:10,069
that's right that's why we're all you

388
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,509
know I'm just learning about notice

389
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:13,009
though and one of the things that you

390
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:15,019
said that it stuck out for me is that

391
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:17,750
when you're doing the rejuvenation of

392
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:21,460
the soil it doesn't necessarily mean dig

393
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,839
it up and bunch of bioactive or natural

394
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,819
supplements to break down and pour back

395
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:29,240
up a whole you're suggesting not

396
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:31,879
breaking up the mycelium traffic at all

397
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,230
and just top dressing for what it sounds

398
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,210
like

399
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,329
and in letting that soak down and

400
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,889
without any attic shuttles expertise

401
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:41,108
yeah that's pretty much correct unless

402
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:43,599
you're really truly / Reformation saying

403
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:46,509
that said having equipment on it you do

404
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:51,099
not rub tailors are really roto killers

405
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:52,329
or made xyt named Venice because think

406
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:55,388
about this we have to tie these

407
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:58,778
creatures on earth that live in the soil

408
00:18:55,388 --> 00:19:03,128
beneath our feet and you take a roto

409
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:05,888
tiller or plow or some kind of implement

410
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:09,939
and you start stirring that up all you

411
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:15,308
are doing is being in killing the soil

412
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:17,109
microbiome and so if the soil microbial

413
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:18,999
is a source of nutrients and there's

414
00:19:17,108 --> 00:19:21,759
this biological Bazaar and all of these

415
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:24,460
exchanges going on you don't want to be

416
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,620
cutting that up you want that intact

417
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,990
when you want that

418
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:32,699
and you know it you can't really say

419
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:37,079
that microbes have a brain that they

420
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:39,090
have ways of sensing what is in my meals

421
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,689
and launches and what is in mammoth

422
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,839
microbes

423
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,929
what is intact compost tea and they will

424
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,849
figure out a way to get to that and

425
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,059
incorporate it into their bodies and

426
00:19:47,849 --> 00:20:03,528
then eventually into the soil and then

427
00:19:51,058 --> 00:20:09,480
into the plan so yeah on this situation

428
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:12,319
from the perspective I know if you're

429
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,319
trying to write a cover crop

430
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:18,470
so they are trying

431
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,150
but what I found works or to know with

432
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,549
our growers that are growing

433
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,860
raised beds is to let me disturb the

434
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:27,079
couple first couple inches of this

435
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:28,909
little so we're not going very deep but

436
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,059
the the top layer there is is naturally

437
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,980
like this dirty in nature anyway but we

438
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:39,799
need to get the nutrients faster into

439
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:42,380
the rhizosphere cyclocross 36 hours have

440
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:44,000
to involve our first prop so it's a

441
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,320
little different situation when you have

442
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,799
a dark person's ability and I dunno guys

443
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:55,220
I'm doing exactly man described good

444
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:58,359
results - we just got with our claws and

445
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:05,600
because I work with slightly better

446
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:09,319
responses by good point is that there is

447
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:11,750
not really any only right way to do the

448
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,970
new soils right you're dealing with a a

449
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,700
living system that's going to respond to

450
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,470
all the efforts that you put into it but

451
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,509
also it's work against the teammate

452
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,850
trying to make up for the things that

453
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:25,099
are lacking as well and based on your

454
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:26,240
soil and your finances and what you may

455
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,789
already have

456
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,410
the closet your solution was not

457
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,869
necessarily to be just like a neighbors

458
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,400
solution so this is this is you know

459
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:36,709
takes a little bit of research maybe a

460
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,450
lot of good research and some patience

461
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,380
but in the end you can suss out the

462
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,670
solutions for yourself so so technically

463
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,110
we're gonna start with you and then

464
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,900
we're going to add and then back to

465
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:50,599
hammer so so a great deal of what makes

466
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,580
Canada scribe express the bold colors

467
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,069
that you love and back appeal and

468
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:57,379
develop cookies that just smell great

469
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:59,480
are the micronutrients right what one of

470
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,970
your favorite methods to decrease the

471
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,170
presence and bioavailability of

472
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:10,009
micronutrients so I think it comes back

473
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:12,050
to what you have making sure those

474
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:14,119
nutrients are available and having the

475
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:16,789
means to delivers nutrients to the

476
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,739
plants and that's the practical

477
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:21,230
application of know what nutrients you

478
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,390
have applying them when you need to and

479
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,000
having the right microbiome school mark

480
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,920
around right here

481
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,140
sighing little those nutrients that

482
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,330
simply and you can sense that they come

483
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,610
in different ways you can obviously test

484
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:35,740
your solos you can be very conscious of

485
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:37,539
what you're adding in and you can add in

486
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,460
everything with complete precision to

487
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:41,379
the high hand level as far as any kind

488
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,049
of micro minitec you want but then you

489
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:47,050
have to understand how those inputs are

490
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:49,059
transferring up to your plant nutrient

491
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,169
issue analysis if you can follow

492
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:56,409
nutrients from the bottom from the back

493
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:58,660
but moment of action gets into your soil

494
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,580
and your writing sphere and all those

495
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,769
new tunes up and then you can also look

496
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:06,309
at the nutrients and the responsive

497
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:09,039
implants initially so taking that step

498
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:10,419
by step understanding and everything we

499
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,250
do here and what we're talking about is

500
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,320
an experiment you know there's not one

501
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,670
right solution your different substrates

502
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,379
we're going to have different responses

503
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,019
to microbes and different region

504
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,450
influence micronutrient influence the

505
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:25,059
more complex the more complex decisions

506
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,640
going to be and I wanted to what was

507
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:30,399
said and then previous conversation you

508
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:35,309
know external health and then a living

509
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,499
soil and the microbiome is a huge thing

510
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:39,509
continuously more so important in

511
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:42,659
agriculture but there's this practical

512
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:44,579
balance in managed systems we are not

513
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:47,278
going to make nature because there is

514
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:49,859
this little disturbance it is implicit

515
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,398
with managing soil and managing across

516
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:56,638
and so we're trying to do is practically

517
00:23:53,398 --> 00:24:00,418
apply a nature where it makes sense in

518
00:23:56,638 --> 00:24:02,788
our managed systems and acknowledging

519
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,070
the functions of nature they can have

520
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:07,138
how to plug them in to your managed

521
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,878
systems and apply them to get the

522
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:11,099
benefits is the way we need to think

523
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:13,648
about this there's no way we're

524
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:16,408
recreating nature in a pot there's no

525
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:18,538
flavor creating nature in a bet nature's

526
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:20,190
in this term perhaps and hundreds of

527
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:22,919
years and that's what makes it what this

528
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,440
there's this huge scale that makes it as

529
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:28,710
complex as it is what we can do as

530
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,990
humans is understand that bring those in

531
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,680
there acknowledge our limitations and

532
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,940
benefits

533
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,590
like an ecologist said it's a really

534
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,330
good quick wheat harvest of the planet

535
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:41,789
we're pulling out organic matter and

536
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:43,470
nutrients those need to replace every

537
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:45,480
cycle and that's something that you

538
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,460
don't apply typically in nature so

539
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,440
that's it that's an important aspect to

540
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,870
consider in terms of the micronutrients

541
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,120
he touched on the soil testing when I

542
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:55,589
would say is so let's say what I

543
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:58,339
typically find them together this is

544
00:24:55,589 --> 00:25:02,009
soils tend to be low and negative higher

545
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:03,829
copper and some kind of stick and so we

546
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:21,059
need to get those nutrients back in the

547
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:22,589
easiest way but the other option there's

548
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,579
a couple companies that take these

549
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:28,199
sulfates and and helium I see like

550
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:30,599
violin

551
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,609
and I'll be I'll be on another day in

552
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:36,689
Canada by Q lading and what has

553
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:38,759
essentially makes it a little bit you

554
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,710
guys are take that so these are things

555
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,139
that can be applied holding the

556
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,210
perspective or in case a small branch

557
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:48,599
and retest yourself and see how much

558
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,009
that raised the my confusion about but I

559
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,538
think that's one thing that a lot of

560
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:54,538
people don't consider is these

561
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:59,368
micronutrients and you're also being in

562
00:25:54,538 --> 00:26:01,999
my care micronutrients from there as

563
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:01,999
well as

564
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,330
yeah I think we're probably all this

565
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:16,990
revenue sitting here and especially

566
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:21,159
probably mycorrhizae funds right and I

567
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:23,679
think that cultivation practices where

568
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:27,009
your microscope which our calculations

569
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,130
are are high are functioning a really

570
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:33,460
good way to get access to all these

571
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,950
nutrients that are bound up in the rocks

572
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,480
that are in the soil and they say rocks

573
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,660
I don't mean you know maybe boulders

574
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:44,140
weather particles rock particles that

575
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:46,570
are out of the soil they are made but

576
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:50,620
many of these minerals there's no tag

577
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:53,460
just listed out and here we have this

578
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:56,619
what drive that started a

579
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,130
co-evolutionary relationship with the

580
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:02,829
natural world millions of years ago

581
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:05,679
before there were plants they were micro

582
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:10,720
sponges they were the decomposers at

583
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:13,480
that time that were were decomposing the

584
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,370
organic matter is around plants came out

585
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,000
of the oceans and the underwater bodies

586
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:21,759
and the struct of relationships with

587
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,690
these my horizon sunshine that are every

588
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,750
bit as as

589
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:30,169
and specialized in intimate as those

590
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:32,298
that go on between pollinators and the

591
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:34,629
flowering plants so I think we've got

592
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:38,690
this piece of biology that is

593
00:27:34,628 --> 00:27:41,028
long-standing ancient and when you've

594
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:43,940
got those micro bright sunshine it and

595
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:46,490
extend they're functionally basically

596
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,230
extending a plant's roots out of two

597
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,690
areas of the soil the plant would

598
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:53,389
otherwise not have access to and so I

599
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:56,509
think ways of encouraging the my prized

600
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:58,729
project so that they're making these

601
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:01,909
things the soil is the various micro

602
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:06,139
nutrients and minerals available to the

603
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:08,690
plant it's sort of like what if this is

604
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:12,258
some maybe this is a little too smart

605
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,000
how smart huh stuff but my greatest of

606
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:16,819
security issues but I would sort of like

607
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,849
it if the Postal Service could deliver

608
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:23,418
my package not just to my door but

609
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:25,939
inside out and inside the cupboard where

610
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:30,980
it is that I mean it and so I think this

611
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,778
is there's an sometimes being people are

612
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,149
starting to add things into the soil you

613
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:37,628
really want to make sure

614
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:39,278
they're biomechanical and one one way of

615
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:41,798
doing that is to make sure you've got

616
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:45,429
robust of microphones and populations

617
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:47,348
and and that you've got a plant it's

618
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:48,819
pushing the exudates out because that's

619
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:50,499
authorized not going to hand over any

620
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:52,959
minerals knows there's something on the

621
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:57,399
other hand so it's it's really having

622
00:28:52,959 --> 00:29:00,009
this whole this whole system in the soil

623
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:02,438
between the plant and the microwave

624
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:04,538
great you know sort of do really well on

625
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:05,860
time I'm going to add a little question

626
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:07,569
that I didn't

627
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:09,759
since we're doing some a long time I

628
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:12,250
recognize a lot of faces in the audience

629
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,658
of people who are pretty dedicated to

630
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,940
living soil people and I've spoken with

631
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:17,950
before and I think that it would be a

632
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,080
missed opportunity to have you three

633
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:26,110
experts here without asking you you know

634
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:27,428
if people ask you questions in person

635
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:30,729
via email

636
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:32,288
other than get your soil tested which I

637
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,808
know would be probably uniform answer

638
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:37,269
other than get your soil tested what

639
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:39,339
would you say is one piece of advice

640
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:41,169
that you would offer folks that are

641
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:49,298
developing their living soil for their

642
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:51,549
farm that oh my gosh I wish they would

643
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:54,879
have known ax what does that think if

644
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:59,829
you just wish so that they're more

645
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:01,600
laid-back success and starting great do

646
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:03,609
you think about this a lot people all

647
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,668
the time I think one of the biggest gaps

648
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:09,428
this is inherent knowledge of what I

649
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:13,059
heard in groups actually do you know

650
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:15,460
there's my horizon understood there's

651
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:17,408
another kind of sympathetic fungi that

652
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,269
are available in products and in nature

653
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:20,278
of course

654
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:21,749
many different species and groups of

655
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:23,759
bacteria and they all have these

656
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:26,700
different functions and if you group

657
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,588
them all as microbes you're missing the

658
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,660
resolution that you need from precision

659
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:31,940
agriculture and that's

660
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,680
we need if we're going to apply migrants

661
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,140
with precision especially in our canvas

662
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,038
gross you know for example I was just

663
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:42,580
talking about us good work

664
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:44,408
they're not capable they are really

665
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:46,658
important symbiotic they will actually

666
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:49,929
infect your plant root and they'll

667
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:51,879
create my muscular sites in the cortical

668
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:54,460
cells of your plant roots and they

669
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:56,500
extend out major it's critical because

670
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,990
they extend out beyond the surface area

671
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,548
of your roots to take in more complaints

672
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,589
and take a cold water and there's

673
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:05,230
actually these things Jane Doe Hospice

674
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:07,869
Department like alluded in that

675
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:11,528
particular relationship it's really

676
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:14,979
important but that's all that lunch I

677
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:17,079
really does and so is it applicable for

678
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,639
your hydroponic system ask yourself that

679
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:20,019
question would implementations of

680
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:21,668
infection sites those are the type of

681
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:25,388
things that I would be asking as a

682
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:27,429
grower if I wasn't thinking into the you

683
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:29,740
know details of microbiology would have

684
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:31,629
bacteria do you know bacteria are very

685
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,370
handsome adequate capable they're really

686
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:34,699
not going to affect your plants early

687
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:36,648
beneficial

688
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:40,909
but they continued the psychic nutrients

689
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:42,678
nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfur

690
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:45,169
micronutrients and make them

691
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,788
bioavailable they're not delivering them

692
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,440
to your plant they're making them

693
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:50,778
available so your plan can take them up

694
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,028
there's other species of trichoderma

695
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:55,220
that are really good at cycling carbon

696
00:31:53,028 --> 00:31:56,720
ammonia creates an enzymes for carbon

697
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,490
degradation and breaks down them at the

698
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,548
in general and there's interactions

699
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,259
between all these things it's not simple

700
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:05,720
it takes some time to kind of soak

701
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:07,519
information but if you understand what

702
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,339
these groups are doing you can think

703
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,259
about what the importance is of those in

704
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:15,470
particularly grow and how you can apply

705
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:17,120
those with confidence that they're gonna

706
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,339
benefit your plan in a particular

707
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,048
environment that you have so we're going

708
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:22,428
to be more eligible and if you are a

709
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:25,158
physician

710
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:27,320
the world and how we're growing and

711
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,659
summer you know across the board

712
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:37,128
beneficial for different reasons that

713
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:38,778
excites your attack yeah I think talk

714
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:40,519
more with sort of organic and

715
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:42,679
conventional farmers that really

716
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,999
cannabis growers but one of the things

717
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,538
that I always find so interesting

718
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:49,429
especially if I go to somebody's arm and

719
00:32:47,538 --> 00:32:51,888
this is what I would encourage everybody

720
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:53,899
knew particularly maybe the required

721
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:57,349
missile and recently are you thinking of

722
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:59,689
doing so I think it's really a good idea

723
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:03,469
to learn what you can about the history

724
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:06,558
of that of that land and look around of

725
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,240
the landscape and to see how is it that

726
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:12,378
things are happening like where some of

727
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,359
the native plant communities like what

728
00:33:12,378 --> 00:33:18,109
kinds of plants do you see really

729
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:22,128
thriving talking with your neighbor

730
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:23,479
farmers because one of the you know this

731
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:25,379
depends maybe they're not going to tell

732
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,690
you more

733
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:32,080
you want to know you want to know okay

734
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,730
so they tried that didn't see might work

735
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,949
but I think I see a way maybe between

736
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,170
back so I think there's a lot to be

737
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:41,350
gained from talking with other

738
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:43,269
cultivators and from looking at the

739
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:47,709
landscape in which you're growing

740
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:50,920
tentative so just take note of things

741
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,000
like the direction that the Sun is

742
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,830
coming from and how you're thinking

743
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,400
maybe of sighting buildings with

744
00:33:53,829 --> 00:34:00,579
sighting he feels it's time I was in a

745
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:03,790
outdoor Canada's Parliament summer and

746
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:06,279
he's they were getting hammered I don't

747
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:08,230
remember what direction the wind was

748
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:10,329
coming from but they said yeah I didn't

749
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,099
know when we set things up here that the

750
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:15,279
wind they always came out of the same

751
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:17,529
the sound but they had some of the

752
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,260
plants were staked they were getting so

753
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:23,530
beaten by the wind so it's paying

754
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,930
attention to sort of the physical and

755
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:28,150
natural features of a piece of property

756
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:31,509
so that you know so they could take

757
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:34,380
advantage of what it is you have there

758
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:37,380
so that would be my own history twice

759
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,380
yeah

760
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,989
but I think that's really important for

761
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,169
me I'm gonna take a totally different

762
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:51,039
approach to this and say there's a whole

763
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:54,368
bunch of people out there trying to sell

764
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,449
myself included in every college

765
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:59,510
evaluate what they can miss a look at

766
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:01,009
the ingredient list really take a smart

767
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,320
man why are you throwing the way you're

768
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,720
going and just really evaluate that

769
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,670
because I find a lot of people will pop

770
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:09,799
that in the rap you know 30 samples at

771
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,720
your back better garden don't apply all

772
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,280
of them all at once with no scientific

773
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:15,649
method then you really don't know what

774
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,960
they didn't think so I would say

775
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:21,099
challenge the claims of their looked at

776
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:25,929
agriculture if you really want to see

777
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,930
where products are successful if

778
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:32,570
greenhouses or agriculture than that

779
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:35,059
speaks volumes in ways like for example

780
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,260
my present fungus you know there is

781
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:39,119
information out there and educate

782
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:43,260
yourself on like we know that we can't

783
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:47,858
was formerly called Globus interosseous

784
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:50,440
Moschino cannabis also has been changed

785
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:52,449
to rise of things the regulares but you

786
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,220
can look on a label and see if it has it

787
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:56,048
on there and you can purchase that part

788
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:57,759
of Canada planner so you're not buying

789
00:35:56,048 --> 00:36:02,170
back to my cries in which context

790
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,849
Congress necessarily plan the eat one

791
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,289
specific for your crop and then you can

792
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:07,660
look at score counts and saying okay

793
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:11,910
when this product has this port now is

794
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:14,318
it accurate that's another part of a

795
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:16,690
it's a starting point of these and then

796
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:18,909
take it back and run trials you know I

797
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,230
think fortunate your gardeners mean I

798
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:22,268
think you need to try and help move

799
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:25,719
things and testing out his ideas and his

800
00:36:22,268 --> 00:36:28,649
products and see

801
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:31,868
something you wanted

802
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:34,150
well said they think the idea of making

803
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:35,829
sure you look at the ingredients and

804
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,450
maybe even ask questions and confirm

805
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,279
that's a good idea I was talking with

806
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:41,679
Kevin judging from Wonderland a nursery

807
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,600
the other day and he's like you know the

808
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,879
reason why we're finding out there's so

809
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,860
many hidden things in these products for

810
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,930
cannabis because it's horribly we could

811
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,630
sue them that they were selling us VX

812
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:54,789
right we had to just take it and we have

813
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,800
to be quiet because we were during the

814
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:58,599
Prohibition days but now now the

815
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,760
legitimate companies that we gotta be

816
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,368
some amount of legal standing some of

817
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,869
these companies that are selling

818
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:06,430
products with hidden ingredients are

819
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,500
going to be taken to tax so don't be

820
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:09,849
afraid of being a part of that so we go

821
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,619
ahead and we have time for a couple

822
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:15,159
questions we're using this awesome

823
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:18,039
device today check tech and all you need

824
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:20,109
to do is when I hand it or toss it to

825
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:22,150
you capture it and just talk to it

826
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,079
because it's microphone right here so so

827
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:30,240
I'm just got a question

828
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:30,239
Oh real come on excellent

829
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:40,149
dad Univision earlier supplements

830
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,519
you needed nutrients put a micro

831
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,720
you know I think we repeat the questions

832
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,269
had the leprechaun didn't take out

833
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:49,599
though hello notepad just you reject

834
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:52,420
every dude thank you so there he was

835
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,549
asking if these healing and

836
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:59,530
micronutrients are affecting the

837
00:37:54,550 --> 00:38:00,220
microbial population that's a great

838
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,740
question

839
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:08,739
I know we copper present what we're

840
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:11,019
talking about so very very small yeah

841
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:16,089
copper sulfate on the other hand

842
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:18,730
yes tell micro so you do want to be

843
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:21,100
aware that I think Colin might be a

844
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:24,510
better person to answer this but in my

845
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,509
experience there

846
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,599
yeah just attack I'm going to think

847
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,730
that's exactly right you know like all

848
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:39,650
of us you had enough of any more things

849
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,750
whatever in the day we might return a

850
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,630
sneaky way and so you're not having

851
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:46,179
anything

852
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,550
really it just animal makes instead of

853
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:51,250
steeds effectuation Stefan yeah help me

854
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:53,800
my program population bacterium is

855
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:56,559
plunging bill chelate nutrients but

856
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,170
there's that process and evidence war

857
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,059
quickly available to the plant and so

858
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,760
there isn't that the delivery trade off

859
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:07,029
the chair that you're negotiating

860
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,500
and things like that I would risk it all

861
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:11,170
except for what tax and making a

862
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,219
commercial for the castle they bring up

863
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,340
one thing that I

864
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:20,059
is micronized pigments you are my cousin

865
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:22,650
phosphorus the plan

866
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:24,900
which has all these other benefits in

867
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:33,300
English so we do want to be careful in

868
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:34,829
that regard because a relation point

869
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,340
that it might get into the details on

870
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:40,230
but in others Allah research published

871
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,019
fingers out there where they even see

872
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,789
direct auto correlations with a negative

873
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:47,789
correlation with increased phosphorus

874
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:49,829
levels and decrease infection rates

875
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:51,539
mycorrhizae and infections it sounds

876
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:52,650
like a bad thing which we have to have

877
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:54,150
that in the success and that

878
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:56,940
relationship between that planet and a

879
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,800
particular punch i if you have excessive

880
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,019
buffers and there's ranged out there

881
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,150
that a critical range is then really

882
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:05,039
limit the infection and so thinking

883
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,230
about those things it's the interactions

884
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,820
are no black or white there's all these

885
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,329
interactions that's what makes a little

886
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,330
complicated

887
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,119
[Applause]

888
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:49,469
Wow it's music to my ears

889
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:50,360
yeah there has been few for me is

890
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:52,739
assertive

891
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,740
let's put it this way small part of our

892
00:40:52,739 --> 00:41:01,079
me is it's maybe in the early stages of

893
00:40:55,739 --> 00:41:03,179
a revolution no-till which means not

894
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,029
using the plat that's when you hear the

895
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:08,460
word no-till that means that farmers not

896
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:11,790
using a cloud that they're getting seeds

897
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:14,159
into the ground by dropping really just

898
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:17,429
a very small drop you see the moving on

899
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:20,329
so in an orchard situation which is

900
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:24,750
different as you have established trees

901
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:27,869
yeah some people are plows are also use

902
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,670
for lead control and so what the kind of

903
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:31,710
urgently wanted some fortunates are

904
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:36,450
doing this is they're doing cover crops

905
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:40,019
and allowing uh some weeds to come in

906
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:42,629
the rows between their trees because we

907
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:46,440
talked about all this life in the soil

908
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:48,990
and if you're running on an annual basis

909
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,570
or more frequently some kind of a plow

910
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:55,429
their rows between your trees you're

911
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:58,559
ripping that soil exposing it to erosion

912
00:41:55,429 --> 00:42:01,949
off you know what remembers the

913
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:05,789
microbiome so some some fruit growers

914
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:10,618
are moving just more toward Noto as are

915
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:12,750
some video White Rose growers as well I

916
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:15,480
will tell you this I notice there in the

917
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:19,530
room that the outdoor campus apartment

918
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,780
over to as summer they were on the right

919
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,900
track with a lot of things but one of

920
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,329
the things that I didn't like seeing

921
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:30,130
as if there was an open soil in between

922
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:33,380
the roads where they had their plans and

923
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:35,630
and I just looked at that but there can

924
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,309
be plants growing here not cannabis

925
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,829
plants but other kind of plants that

926
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:42,650
could be walked upon and the whole thing

927
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:45,170
about a cover crop or why you want your

928
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:47,690
soil covered as we talked about exudates

929
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:51,019
the by hospitals are all these things a

930
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:53,838
plant is a food factory for the

931
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:56,630
microbiome so when I saw those bare

932
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:59,179
patches much like this this Iowa right

933
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,789
here on that after a girl farm I thought

934
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:03,739
wow they can be feeding a bunch of

935
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:06,500
microbes that are gonna be feeding the

936
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:09,229
cannabis plant so I would like to see

937
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:14,059
some kind of a cover crop it's walked

938
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:16,159
walkable and and get all of this covered

939
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:19,160
get get all of this covered up and so

940
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:21,848
that's sort of the idea was some you

941
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:21,848
know orchardist

942
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:32,048
we just you know grow things and ideas

943
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:32,048
on that yeah

944
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:54,160
but there's a penis I should know

945
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:55,808
there's some Japanese but it's a great

946
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:59,049
book and it talks about this cocktail

947
00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:04,329
more detail if you're interested in it

948
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:09,220
but I think it into into these Outsiders

949
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:12,000
for a long time the micro these microbes

950
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:15,089
in microcosm

951
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,280
Pisco a second in general and culture

952
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,140
and migrant in general microgrid last

953
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,330
event sort of God probably city the

954
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:23,579
cleanest place that chemical fertilizer

955
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:25,319
over the next two decades it's a human

956
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:27,179
we work with a lot of many doors alot

957
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,289
strawbeary doors they think there's a

958
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:31,469
second high please

959
00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:33,929
these compatibilities it has to scale it

960
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:36,149
has to bring a huge ROI on our way that

961
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:38,099
makes sense and has to fit right into

962
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,829
those management axes and so not all

963
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:47,549
practices I think up to the conventional

964
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:49,949
farming practices but again testing and

965
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,390
you know about the actual application to

966
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:53,279
visit us it's important to remember too

967
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:55,710
that you know the way that consumers

968
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,960
like going are towards living soil they

969
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:01,320
don't want pesticides they use they

970
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:04,230
don't want is used in one way or another

971
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,430
is tending towards living soil is it is

972
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,559
matter fact it's a it's a it's a

973
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:09,960
marketing minute for you to say if your

974
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,759
plants are growing and living soil so so

975
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,079
if you're thinking like oh man this is

976
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,540
just something else I'm going to have to

977
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,579
spend my time on you know so maybe that

978
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:18,719
both is self education but also giving

979
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:20,639
some help to the marketing department

980
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,519
because it's going to make your product

981
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:26,230
more desirable so I want to make how

982
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,420
about from

983
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:31,480
ten husky from keep it simple organics

984
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:34,690
and and big play and so couple of things

985
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,608
so so Colin is at the mammoth microbes

986
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,798
dude if you want to chat with him

987
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:40,838
further and and I will actually be

988
00:45:38,798 --> 00:45:43,179
signing her look and do have copies

989
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:45,338
available to work out so you could buy

990
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:48,759
copies of her book also at the mammoth

991
00:45:45,338 --> 00:45:52,630
micros food tab has got his food that

992
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:56,679
keep it simple organic food and also but

993
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:59,559
