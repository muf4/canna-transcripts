1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,280
[Applause]

2
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:43,370
you have two green so we are at a

3
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,588
distant a major of pro cannabis cultural

4
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:48,228
shift you might call it a surge in our

5
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:51,350
society I think CBD cannabidiol has been

6
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:53,838
a big part of that yeah ten years ago

7
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,570
very few people knew anything about CBD

8
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:59,210
it's not that well-known compound wasn't

9
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,009
part of the Medical Marijuana experience

10
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,088
in California in Canada

11
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:06,890
ten years ago aside from a relatively

12
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:11,569
small number of scientists it really

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:15,909
wasn't on everybody's radar and today we

14
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:19,250
have this huge explosion of interest now

15
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,899
you can get CBD and air stations even

16
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,359
though it's not technically legal to do

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,670
that in California and in that sense

18
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,659
it's not illusion it's all over the

19
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:32,750
country like that in the United States

20
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:35,330
so I think what I'd like to do is focus

21
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,069
a little bit on the history some of the

22
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,599
current scientific of therapeutic

23
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:41,899
developments and also look at the legal

24
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:44,419
situation but when we first rediscovered

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,300
as some of the CBD rich strange as we

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,930
call them back in 2009 in Northern

27
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:53,109
California we had a sense right away

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,670
because we knew about CBD from

29
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:57,799
scientific literature that this could be

30
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,560
it had a major impact on the medical

31
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,590
marijuana community and the medical

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,640
marijuana experience and not simply

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:10,930
because of CBD had a great deal of

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,789
therapeutic potential according to the

35
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,890
extensive animal studies preclinical

36
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:18,318
work and some whatever work but also we

37
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,298
had a sense at the time that CBD because

38
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,028
it's not toxic in because it's not

39
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:26,028
psychoactive like THC and I always add

40
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:27,889
the might THC because C is a mood

41
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:29,590
changer it doesn't get your stone but it

42
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:32,269
is a mood changer it can be

43
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,150
antidepressant antianxiety and so forth

44
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:37,549
but we suspected at the time that this

45
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,510
could be a real game-changer in that it

46
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:44,150
could help to liberate cabinets for the

47
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:46,598
from the drug abuse paradigm so writers

48
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,718
whether when we since back in 2000

49
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:52,119
that ended up forming projects EDD that

50
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:53,769
could have a major influence even above

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,408
the beyond what it might do for someone

52
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:58,359
therapeutically then it can influence

53
00:02:55,408 --> 00:03:02,489
the social landscape as a whole

54
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:06,459
and I think our intuition is born out of

55
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:08,378
some ways observing that are watching as

56
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:10,239
the whole city narrative as I'm holding

57
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:12,310
well it's been very exciting and amazing

58
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,250
and remarkable that's also is somewhat

59
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,799
disconcerted you see some ways to some

60
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,479
things we didn't expect so just to start

61
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,889
now in the early history and we're going

62
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,259
to move through quickly because we don't

63
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:26,109
have that much time but sanity was first

64
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:28,149
isolated from a hemp plant by Roger

65
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:33,159
Addison University of Illinois the

66
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:36,209
scientist in the 1963 rat Velma shoe and

67
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:40,358
the eminent Israeli chemist he

68
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:42,459
synthesized the CBD elucidate its kind

69
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:43,870
of destruction but at that time there

70
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,299
wasn't really a lot of research that

71
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,629
followed but most of the focus was on

72
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,609
TMZ effective because TAC got higher as

73
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:53,858
the conservative that was the interest

74
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:56,049
of most people there was a little bit of

75
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,819
research so that Brazil Brazil for some

76
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,909
reason throws been ahead of the curve

77
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:04,078
with CBD in 1980 there was an

78
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:07,508
interesting study that showed CBD had

79
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,269
strong anti-seizure properties but it

80
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:12,688
was a relatively small number of people

81
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:16,000
involved in that research partner

82
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:17,259
focused on and it didn't really go

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,269
anywhere for some reason even though

84
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,400
showed had a significant

85
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,560
anti seizure potential a big

86
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,719
breakthrough 1988 when it's to be one

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,300
receptor was discovered dr. Russo has

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,300
talked about that and that stimulated a

89
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,689
great deal of research that would follow

90
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,399
from this very very exciting research

91
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:39,860
have major implications for medical

92
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,259
scientists and how we understand the

93
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,759
human physiology and human biology and

94
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:49,729
that also trigger or interest to CVD so

95
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,879
he study in 1998 us this is a US

96
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:55,218
government funded study it was published

97
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,899
in the procedure of the National Academy

98
00:04:55,218 --> 00:05:00,259
of Sciences in the United States it's

99
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:02,329
very prestigious study for authors one

100
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:06,499
of them was a Nobel Prize winner the

101
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:09,619
Nobel laureate julius axelrod and the

102
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:11,838
study concluded that both CBD THC were

103
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:15,139
powerful antioxidants that had strong

104
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:17,899
your protective properties this has been

105
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:20,598
this research has been Mis portrayed by

106
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:24,860
I think some of the CBD hemp companies

107
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:27,978
as having laid the basis for a patent on

108
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,158
CBD that's not the case there is a US

109
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:34,128
government at 2003 based on the

110
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:36,498
researchers of THC and CBD not just seed

111
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:38,269
so we should keep that in mind and you

112
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:42,050
might be familiar with cannabinoid said

113
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:44,059
that that refers THC C antioxidant ease

114
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,949
a particular application is to a

115
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:47,959
protected for example limiting your

116
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:50,209
logical damages following scheming

117
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,619
insults such as stroke and trauma or in

118
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:53,418
the treatment of the earth degenerative

119
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:56,209
diseases such as Alzheimer's Parkinson's

120
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:57,978
and HIV intervention so that's the US

121
00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:00,319
government speaking from one side of its

122
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:02,598
mouth and the other side of its mouth is

123
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,468
this is a dangerous drug remember value

124
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:07,209
so here we have a study from 2016

125
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:08,978
published in the UK

126
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:12,609
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal

127
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:14,110
Society and it's talking about again the

128
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,389
neuroprotective properties of

129
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,400
cannabinoids the research again based on

130
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,069
CBD and other cannabinoids you can see

131
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:24,310
in red summarizing cannabinoids protect

132
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:26,530
your eyes on the molecular level normal

133
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,319
brain aging and degenerative diseases

134
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:32,348
are suppressed but cannabinoids that's

135
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,970
very powerful sort of anti-aging and yet

136
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,860
it's been known for quite a while this

137
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,160
is a slide I have to give credit to dr.

138
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,020
Russo based on the translation levels of

139
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,110
the restraints recent translation of the

140
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:46,089
ancient Chinese pharmacopoeia and which

141
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,490
talking about medicinal hand you see

142
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:51,008
protracted taking may make one fat

143
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,598
strong and ever seen I'll so somehow

144
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:55,960
we're just catching up to the ancient

145
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:59,079
Chinese so there's a common theme here

146
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,549
so not to repeat too much what Doctor

147
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,800
Who so said that just to summarize

148
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,228
quickly so why does cannabis workers

149
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,810
because we have plant cannabinoids that

150
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:10,120
mimic the effects and I know many

151
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,860
effects on endogenous cannabinoids and

152
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,379
endogenous cannabinoids are part of the

153
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,150
endocannabinoid system I'm not going to

154
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:19,810
spend too much time on these slides I

155
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:21,879
want to get to CBD but because CBD and

156
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,759
THC interact with the endocannabinoid

157
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,250
system in different ways

158
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,870
I won't repeat the things that dr. Russo

159
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,399
has said so we'll stick to the next

160
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,918
slide the idea is that the

161
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,959
endocannabinoid system is this regulated

162
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:37,240
almost all disease states in one way or

163
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,908
another that this regulation might be an

164
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,660
expression of a deficiency or for the

165
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:44,099
expression of an excess

166
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,890
obesity or certain inflammatory

167
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,830
conditions diabetes liver diseases heart

168
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,539
disease and so forth so moving along I

169
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:54,509
don't want to repeat again all the

170
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,970
information but three key components to

171
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:59,550
keep in mind as we turned out to CBD

172
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,620
the receptors cannabinoid receptors the

173
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,629
endogenous compounds that bind to these

174
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,790
receptors and then various proteins we

175
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:08,100
have in the body that can modulate the

176
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,830
level of the the endogenous cannabinoids

177
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,980
so we'll talk about that in a moment

178
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:16,169
so now CBD particular CBD is known as a

179
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,080
promiscuous compound because it does so

180
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:21,840
many different things interact according

181
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,930
to the study published last year the

182
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:29,459
author was a Mayo Clinic assigned doctor

183
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:32,220
from Minnesota eminent medical

184
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:35,399
institution he identified over specific

185
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,560
CBD interacts with over 65 different

186
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,490
targets in the brain and body that was a

187
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,139
20-17

188
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,788
you could probably had to have been more

189
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,439
easily that's with because new

190
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,779
discoveries are being made all the time

191
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,640
so when you take see CBD you're not just

192
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,470
getting one receptor and turning it on

193
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,049
in a lot so many different things are

194
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,710
going on so the key thing is that unlike

195
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:58,529
THC CBD has little direct binding

196
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,180
affinity for the cannabinoid receptor

197
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:03,480
cb1 and cb2

198
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:06,120
but CBD does by many different receptors

199
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,149
other than the cannabinoid receptors and

200
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,560
CBD also accident many different

201
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,840
receptor independent channels or

202
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,059
pathways so looking at some of the

203
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,320
receptors that CBD binds to one of the

204
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:24,929
sequences serotonin receptors a 5ht one

205
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:28,410
a receptor that mediates experience of

206
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:30,870
anxiety nausea so forth CBD binds very

207
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:33,750
powerfully to this receptor I might add

208
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,759
that CBD a the raw version of CBD before

209
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,519
it's actually heated and or

210
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,899
decarboxylated that actually has a more

211
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,539
potent affinity for this particular

212
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,028
receptor interestingly enough CBD also

213
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:48,088
binds to the serotonin 5 inch 2a

214
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:51,259
receptor to say receptive that LSD is

215
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:54,360
suicidal by - I think there's a panel

216
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:56,159
psychedelic medicine later talk about

217
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,810
that what the significance is on that

218
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:03,600
pattern CBD binds to many receptors in

219
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:07,078
what's called the trick family of

220
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,560
receptors TRP 3wv this is a whole bunch

221
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:14,219
of 3132 triggered so forth and so on and

222
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,859
these receptors mediated very kind of

223
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,050
primal that sensory type of experiences

224
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,659
this is a very ancient receptor system

225
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:22,708
that seems to be a set overlaps and if

226
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,049
committer twins with the

227
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,819
endocannabinoids system and one thing

228
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:30,240
that science is about recently is that

229
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,670
CBD down regulates genes that are linked

230
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,399
to Alzheimer's the via is tricky one

231
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:37,078
receptor but binding to it it's changing

232
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,970
gene expression of the genes linked to

233
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,859
house house this is an example of what

234
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,629
scientists are finding then you have P

235
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,699
part receptors these are receptors that

236
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:47,429
are on the surface and meticulous of the

237
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:50,458
cell not only outside is that the other

238
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:52,859
receptors I just mentioned CBD binds to

239
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,619
one of the people are also up it's very

240
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,360
significant therapeutic implications of

241
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,970
that that can regulate gene expression

242
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,409
and so forth then there's many often

243
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,759
receptors so the read that the

244
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,199
scientific literature should we hear

245
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,480
that

246
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,769
every year GPR gee a couple of

247
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,870
approaching receptor they have different

248
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:14,149
numbers attached and they do different

249
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,299
things and CBD it turns out binds to

250
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:20,509
many of these receptors gr-55 miss

251
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:23,179
identified a few years ago ready then

252
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:26,569
it's involved in regulating bone density

253
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:29,629
when GPR 55 is activated its associated

254
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,089
with cancer cell proliferation CBD is an

255
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:34,669
antagonist maybe it binds to disrespect

256
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,920
receptor to drug that divide the process

257
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:40,909
which might be one of the ways that that

258
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:42,500
CBD has an anti-cancer effect of other

259
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:45,230
receptors I mentioned the glycine

260
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,120
receptor here the point is there are a

261
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,449
lot of different receptors that CBD is

262
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,339
interacting with not furiously not this

263
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:55,039
not the cannabinoid receptor is not

264
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:57,440
directly like THC so there's other

265
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,230
neurotransmitters that CBD interacts

266
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,100
with that influences levels of these

267
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:06,500
tricky neurotransmitters GABA a it's

268
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:11,659
interesting we have dabit as the main

269
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:14,240
inhibitory neurotransmitter and what CBD

270
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:16,909
does it makes an avid a receptor to

271
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,278
function more powerfully or better so

272
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:21,559
when you take CBD your own GABA will

273
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,448
have more of an effect so that's one way

274
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,698
that CBD might have an ant eggs e

275
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:27,559
oolitic or any anxiety reducing effect

276
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:29,179
it's the gaba receptor that's where

277
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,099
valiant is that's without the whole and

278
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:33,979
so forth it will relax you

279
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,139
that's activated there's also the new

280
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,810
and delta opioid receptors that CBD

281
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:41,299
interacts with and Dennis's very very

282
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,919
important compound that CBD is reuptake

283
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:45,469
inhibitor I'll explain that in a moment

284
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,149
also it acts the same way

285
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,600
you can have a nice but reuptake

286
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:53,959
inhibitor and in addition we mean that

287
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,139
it will delay the breakdown and do

288
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,580
reuptake adenosine and also OPA

289
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,289
doggedness cannabinoids and that's a

290
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,910
really cool and very interesting area

291
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:06,589
that I want to focus on for a moment

292
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:09,199
this in 2009 scientists from Stony Brook

293
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,139
University in New York discovered that

294
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,740
the endogenous cannabinoids particularly

295
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:17,840
Ananda mine are transported by certain

296
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,649
molecules called fatty acid binding

297
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,000
proteases

298
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:24,620
and dodges cannabinoids are like the

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,419
plank of eminence their family their

300
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,060
lipids their oily their sticky if you

301
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:30,559
will and you know that doesn't mix too

302
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,989
well with the blood but his blood is

303
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,969
watery so how does how does it work that

304
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,409
car and Dodgers cannabinoids get to

305
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,810
where they need to go or do what they

306
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:41,329
need to do it's because the hitch a ride

307
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:43,250
on this transport molecules called fatty

308
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,970
acid binding proteins so you can think

309
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:49,429
of it kind of almost like a little canoe

310
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,430
that takes these actually where it takes

311
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,719
it through the cell membrane inside the

312
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:55,969
cell but you also have an aqueous

313
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,769
interior where the endogenous

314
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,420
cannabinoids do lots of important

315
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,460
interesting things until they're broken

316
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:05,029
down and decommissioned inside the cell

317
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,560
well in 2015 the same group of

318
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,720
scientists Stony Brook New York

319
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,639
discovered that these same fatty acid

320
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,860
binding proteins are not only carriers

321
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,879
of endogenous cannabinoids but a plant

322
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,060
cannabinoids

323
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:19,789
so what does this mean well because the

324
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:22,099
CBD in particular which tends to be

325
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:25,819
taken in higher doses of intensity so

326
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,350
I'll talk about CBD in this context you

327
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,620
have limited space than that little

328
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,440
canoe and the CBD is sort of gets its

329
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,740
first privileged estimate so if there's

330
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,620
a competition in terms of getting a

331
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,870
space on that fatty acid binding protein

332
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,990
with CVD and then a doggedness

333
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:48,500
cannabinoids CBD yes on and so it

334
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:51,139
displaces or it prevents the endogenous

335
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,490
cannabinoids from going inside the cell

336
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,730
to know what they need to do to be

337
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,960
conditioned so it delays the

338
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,610
decommissioning deactivation of the

339
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,470
endogenous could happen and so what that

340
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,899
means is they're hanging around the

341
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,029
brain longer and more endogenous

342
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:06,679
cannabinoids through the brain more

343
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,659
receptors they're gonna be signaling in

344
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:11,419
a way that s generally have positive

345
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:14,240
benefits so whenever you smoke weed

346
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:18,500
whenever you take pure CBD or a mixture

347
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,570
of oil you are in essence potentially at

348
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,190
least activating your own endogenous

349
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,750
happen and that's what you're doing that

350
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,660
as well so it's part of the experience

351
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:29,330
and I think that's Oh enhancing

352
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:31,850
endocannabinoids tomah v-a uptake in

353
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:35,540
addition may be a key mechanism whereby

354
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:37,129
CBD and THC convert your protection and

355
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:39,799
other health benefits by boosting our

356
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:42,019
own cannabinoids and this is an area

357
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,339
that's uh it's kind of a hot area you

358
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,929
can have a notice summons because

359
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,970
another thing that's been learned is

360
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:49,039
that this fatty acid binding proteins is

361
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,779
over a dozen different ones and they're

362
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,589
all specific to different areas of the

363
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:55,370
body

364
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:59,570
so if scientists can create a compound

365
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,909
that that essentially does what CBD does

366
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,470
that displaces the endogenous

367
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:05,750
cannabinoids

368
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,300
will raise the level of the endogenous

369
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,250
cannabinoids result but they could do so

370
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:12,319
targeting specific areas of the body

371
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,779
which you can't really do it when you

372
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,510
smoke marijuana but you know it's it's a

373
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:19,850
full-on assault our pleasure whatever

374
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,409
and and the same thing with other ways

375
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,560
the science of looking at it if you

376
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:26,899
somehow adjust the levels of the Kanab

377
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,518
in the body well then you can have

378
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,009
greater health effects if you can boost

379
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,129
your endogenous and everyone tell but at

380
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:36,230
last specificity so if you focus in this

381
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,028
area you can there's some group of

382
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,829
interesting potential for pharmaceutical

383
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:41,838
development here and I'm not a big fan

384
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:44,328
of Big Pharma but we should recognize

385
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,059
that there's some some value and the

386
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:48,948
other thing because we're talking about

387
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:51,078
cell membranes and passes to amount of

388
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:53,028
the cell membrane that means that the

389
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,578
quality of the cell membrane the health

390
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:58,308
of sin is it to rigidus it sooth lorises

391
00:16:55,578 --> 00:17:01,578
to permeable will have a key impact on

392
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:03,828
this whole phenomena and diet is still

393
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:05,480
all about diet in the diary and you know

394
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:08,298
cholesterol is a very important element

395
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,000
in the cell membrane so it's something

396
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:13,038
to keep in mind healthy fats are really

397
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,640
really key the Omega threes and so forth

398
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,869
for it for a healthy membrane so

399
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,569
artisinal CBD we'd be talking about the

400
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:26,629
science let's talk about the grassroots

401
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:28,220
as I mentioned that I didn't is you know

402
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,280
we we discovered some of these strains

403
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,440
in Northern California in 2009 initially

404
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,960
and these early strains that would

405
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,120
rediscover we're generally at what does

406
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,038
close out the type to cultivars we don't

407
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,408
speak so much in terms of indicates it's

408
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:45,759
either these days we speak in terms of

409
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:48,370
type one hi Stevie a high THC

410
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:51,549
type two next type three hi sweetie

411
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:53,709
lotuses so initially the strains that

412
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:56,950
were discovered where the type two

413
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,829
mixtures very interesting strains also

414
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:03,279
eventually the ac/dc is that type three

415
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,809
high CBD love THC some ways it's a bit

416
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,930
unfortunate because that's kind of got a

417
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:09,849
lot of the attention because people are

418
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:15,009
growing these plants now basically the

419
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:16,500
harvested or CBD oil and I think we are

420
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:18,369
missing some really valuable

421
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,559
opportunities with these type two

422
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:22,299
strains is very interested in blends of

423
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,519
CBD and THC together

424
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:27,099
one two one three two two or whatever in

425
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,170
ratio depending on how you harvest but

426
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:34,509
because it has been so much interest in

427
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:36,160
CBD per se I think we will have to

428
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:40,059
return to those plants because there's a

429
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,700
lot of value there big change of a big

430
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:45,129
big tipping point in 2013 the program on

431
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:49,630
CNN that really lit everything up and

432
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:51,220
it's had a huge impact certainly from

433
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,540
our perspective in California because

434
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:57,130
all of a sudden CBeebies great demand

435
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,629
and it wasn't before really it was

436
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,730
limited within the

437
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,830
marijuana's will you and even just

438
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,298
limited within that month to itself and

439
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:07,178
all of a sudden people are hearing about

440
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:08,798
and reducing ITV's miraculous outcomes

441
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,548
and is great deal of interest in that

442
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:14,950
that combination of not intoxicated but

443
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:16,990
great medicinal value who is just

444
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:23,160
irresistible for a lot of people and it

445
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:27,910
is / - hyun-joon members there appears

446
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:30,580
so Matt I think this whole idea feeling

447
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,970
without the high the idea that CBD can

448
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:35,349
neutralise THC psychoactivity given its

449
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,509
depending how much of each into the

450
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:40,990
string well it's significant I think if

451
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:43,029
some ways missus is a point yes it is

452
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,279
important that people have options and

453
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:47,500
condemn cannabis products that are

454
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,538
psychoactive like THC that's very

455
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,669
important to have that option but what

456
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:53,829
it's really all about is managing psycho

457
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:55,929
activity because it from our perspective

458
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:58,089
without getting into every condition or

459
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:01,210
every detail you know if you have both

460
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:04,869
THC and CBD of the product and probably

461
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:07,630
help you probably so it's a matter of

462
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:09,788
just having both a you know but then the

463
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,010
question is how much of each and it's

464
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:13,750
not so much a matter of well what's the

465
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:15,759
right ratio with the condition at least

466
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,679
best in our experience thus far at

467
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,230
California but not we don't have to

468
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,320
ratios in addition we match ratios and

469
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:26,048
what people are comfortable the ideas as

470
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:28,689
much THC along with the CBD that a

471
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:33,279
person is comfortable with that's what

472
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:36,370
we focus on so a personal sensitivity to

473
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,629
THC is key and the medical use of

474
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,459
cannabis

475
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,990
depends least initially to a large

476
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,419
degree on managing the psychoactive

477
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:46,179
progress interestingly we've just put a

478
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,429
just published a tale a report yesterday

479
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:50,798
on the project CBD whetstone expensive

480
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,298
record on cannabinoids and drug

481
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,460
interactions and one of the things we

482
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:56,109
learn from research in that and this is

483
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,450
available free you can get it from them

484
00:20:56,109 --> 00:21:01,389
from the President or bring it down for

485
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:05,830
me but it turns out that there are

486
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:12,070
certain of enzymes that CBD will

487
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:13,928
interact with that these enzymes are

488
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:16,210
responsible for metabolizing many

489
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:20,669
different drugs it's the cytochrome p450

490
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:23,169
family and people have different genetic

491
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,480
variants of some of these enzymes and

492
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:28,270
certainly these enzymes will metabolize

493
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,069
CBD except there's genetic variants such

494
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:34,658
that a person might have a polymorphism

495
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:38,439
for lack of a better word the mutation

496
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:40,870
on this gene that encodes a enzyme that

497
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,240
would normally metabolize CBD well

498
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:45,308
there's something odd or unusual about

499
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,970
that such that a person doesn't

500
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:50,918
metabolize the see THC well that's going

501
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,409
to stay in their system a lot longer and

502
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,720
a person that commits could be what it

503
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:58,270
could be a key factor in explaining why

504
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,038
some people just can't handle THC you

505
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:02,500
smoke think you've got a killing off the

506
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:05,140
ceiling about 20 percent of Caucasians

507
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,940
have a variance that would have that

508
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,909
effect it's actually two different

509
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:14,019
enzymes that play into this so and in

510
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:15,350
other people of African descent a little

511
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:18,168
less than 10 percent have

512
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:20,000
very Asians less than 5% but Caucasians

513
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:22,009
in Middle Eastern but one out of five

514
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,470
according with this they have some of

515
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:27,819
the problems with THC and underscores

516
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,720
the importance of what why CBD would be

517
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:33,740
particularly appropriate for the

518
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,600
urbanization process so moving on what

519
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,839
do we finding when we talk about

520
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:41,869
artisinal CBD people is simply using it

521
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,609
at the grassroots we either with the

522
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,619
supervision of a doctor or not the

523
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:47,750
different kinds of products that one can

524
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:49,699
get topical suggestion Aslam a whole

525
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,419
slew of different products brick that

526
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,460
you get for high THC product you can

527
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:58,730
also get for CBD

528
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,100
well we all know about epilepsy and the

529
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,779
dramatic effects and sometimes have my

530
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:06,349
children with these catastrophic seizure

531
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:08,418
disorders and the CBD was just approved

532
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:11,269
as a pharmaceutical united states for

533
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,429
for those conditions but what we're

534
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:16,158
seeing on the ground are CBD is mainly

535
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:17,600
being used and and our website has 50

536
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,250
different conditions you could look at

537
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,529
that the preclinical science a little

538
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,099
bit the clinical sites but the many

539
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:26,450
conditions that we're Sid pain anxiety

540
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:28,308
and depression that's what people are

541
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:32,720
using CBD for if you're talking about

542
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:36,048
just sheer numbers and also a traumatic

543
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,390
brain injury CBD is a really great

544
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:40,908
candidate for what is a very very

545
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:46,028
complex disease traumatic brain injury

546
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:50,229
which resists treatment generally

547
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:51,700
see there's a lot there for for people

548
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,288
with these conditions both with strokes

549
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,759
and traumatic brain injury as the

550
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:57,848
federal government is acknowledged

551
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:59,200
impact and certain football players in

552
00:23:57,848 --> 00:24:02,589
the United States athletes are coming

553
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,058
out saying this really does help and but

554
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:06,128
I think another area that's been a big

555
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:10,089
huge event in the near future is

556
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:11,949
metabolic syndrome diabetes obesity we

557
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:14,798
practice anything we hear from a lot of

558
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,080
people that share their testimonials as

559
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,158
it were with us and we've got a number

560
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:22,749
of folks saying that when they start on

561
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,619
CBD regiment and usually it's high CBD

562
00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:28,598
low THC they think that they did before

563
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:30,638
a national tournaments looking at their

564
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:34,298
blood sugar not very certain resistance

565
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:36,189
numbers and going on a CBD treatment

566
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:38,829
regimen for six weeks brings those

567
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,690
numbers down at the right direction and

568
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:42,728
and we've seen this now in a number of

569
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,409
cases with people so I think and this is

570
00:24:42,729 --> 00:24:45,909
how he makes an impression it's thick

571
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:47,889
and I'm observational except there are

572
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:49,539
actually numbers of blood tests that we

573
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:51,908
could look at I think this is going to

574
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:54,398
be huge in the future given how

575
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:58,929
widespread is a Western diet that abala

576
00:24:54,398 --> 00:25:02,278
syndrome is also uh people are using CBD

577
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:05,320
and THC for cancer and I think years of

578
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:07,538
there's also a great potential and where

579
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:10,049
we see for preclinical research and also

580
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:13,390
anecdotal

581
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:17,200
observations is that the CBD and THC

582
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,540
combined with chemotherapy combined with

583
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,970
radiation has a greater than one plus

584
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:22,720
one in fact that they really potentiate

585
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,700
each other

586
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,600
so that CBD can it can make the keyless

587
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,250
chemotherapy as strong they use less

588
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,919
which is very highly toxic chemotherapy

589
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,180
register anytime you can use less to

590
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,460
have the same effect as you would

591
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,970
otherwise that's a good thing and CBD

592
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,319
also has its own anti-tumor properties

593
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,700
combined with that then it can just help

594
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:47,529
the difficulties of going through

595
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,779
chemotherapy so that's another area

596
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:52,059
that's very exciting and that's part of

597
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:54,670
this grassroots laboratory experiment

598
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:56,799
democracy we see going on now it's DVD

599
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:59,110
and cannabis therapeutics and finally

600
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:03,220
people are using it as a preventive and

601
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:04,869
I think that's it's legitimate it's I

602
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,240
don't know where this is all going but

603
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:10,479
people say how do they describe it

604
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,549
people that want to describe or what's

605
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,890
what's taking CBD with what is it like

606
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:17,619
taking CBD it's like having a really

607
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,930
good day that's release which is what

608
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,609
they say that LSD my producer - there's

609
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,778
something

610
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:25,898
but any case let's move on quickly

611
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:27,880
impact of CBD CBD has accentuated a

612
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:30,609
national international pro campus

613
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,620
cultural shift CBD has shifted the

614
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:35,740
public discussion about medical cannabis

615
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:38,648
from whether it works to had a music for

616
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,450
Maxima therapeutic benefit CBD in the

617
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:42,908
United States the backward country that

618
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:46,058
I'm from has catalyzed the rebirth of

619
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:48,309
the US domestic hemp industry you wear

620
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:50,470
exact what country and is not yet really

621
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:54,220
legal in the United States dust really

622
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:57,519
have been growing it might be soon but

623
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,778
also have the CBD colossal big dollar so

624
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,460
that's kind of a good thing

625
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:09,429
they're predicted twenty two billion

626
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:13,960
dollars so there's a lot going on where

627
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:16,720
this huge consumer demand from CD what

628
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,629
about Hep C well in 2014 in the United

629
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,179
States that passed the farm bill which

630
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:24,939
defined hemp legally for the first time

631
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:29,019
as the cannabis plant where is no part

632
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,778
of the plan exceeded greater than 0.3

633
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:34,778
percent THC unfortunately they didn't

634
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:36,669
define an apartment so probably there's

635
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,648
no hammock plants in the world like this

636
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:39,730
because you probably have some hemp

637
00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:42,339
plant with the Tri Club

638
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,778
that's more than 0.3 percent THC that is

639
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:45,788
a part but I don't want to get too

640
00:27:43,778 --> 00:27:47,500
technical here the point is that the

641
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:50,138
farm bill in the United States did not

642
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,119
actually legalize hemp or CBD well it

643
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:55,329
really did was create a temporary

644
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:56,888
exemption so that state licensed farmers

645
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:59,470
in certain states that would legalize

646
00:27:56,888 --> 00:28:02,949
the growing of it could grow in an

647
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:06,669
experimental basis now that experimental

648
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:09,879
basis and does not say commercial use of

649
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:11,080
what they used that loophole the hemp

650
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:13,898
growers to really draw

651
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:19,178
she fleed through it so you have

652
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:20,859
commercial growing and it comes down to

653
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,659
really read lyrics it's a matter of

654
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:24,609
interpretation because it doesn't

655
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:27,278
specify that hemp could be grown

656
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:30,638
experimentally for commercial use but it

657
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:32,378
doesn't say it can so if you want to see

658
00:28:30,638 --> 00:28:33,908
it one way you could say it's legal to

659
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:36,638
grow the commercial use according to

660
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:38,169
Pancho if you want to see if you know

661
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:40,209
letter of the law kind of thing that

662
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,580
it's like though it's not and you can

663
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,009
argue about the interpretation the

664
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:47,558
problem here is that the Controlled

665
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:51,298
Substances Act the United States or 1970

666
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:54,849
still exists and it says that anything

667
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:57,638
extracted from the resin of the plant is

668
00:28:54,849 --> 00:29:01,148
illegal and that's where CBD comes from

669
00:28:57,638 --> 00:29:03,219
the rest so you can interpret all you

670
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:05,738
want but as long as the controlled

671
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:09,759
substance act still exists we've got a

672
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:11,379
big problem and talk a little more about

673
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,720
where I think this is going was another

674
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:14,980
farm dualism will be passed probably by

675
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,038
the end of the year which will actually

676
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,849
legalize growing on industrial hemp in

677
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,210
the United States

678
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:24,339
so despite DEA FDA approval unregulated

679
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:30,100
head of CBD Cobbers proliferate

680
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:32,849
throughout the United States so here's

681
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:36,189
some images here you can see on the Left

682
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:38,079
that's a hep better have grown for fiber

683
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,450
you know have has had this tremendous

684
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,480
plant Huan ER have so many different

685
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:46,450
uses so there you see almost looked like

686
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,460
a big boob and then next to that is hemp

687
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:52,069
grow for the seed oil see Dalal says

688
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:55,940
industrial uses it's very nutritional on

689
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:57,918
mega threes and so forth that's what you

690
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,480
see the second from the left and then

691
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,490
farther the right that that's kind of

692
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,940
his plants what we call marijuana that's

693
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,079
right

694
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:07,730
now what is in the middle though there

695
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:09,558
what does that look like the one second

696
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,298
to the right is that those plants they

697
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,099
look like industrial hemp does it look

698
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:16,418
like marijuana marijuana is the

699
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:19,119
flowertots of high residence of kennix

700
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:22,340
industrial has is low resident cannabis

701
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:25,069
marijuana high-risk candidates what does

702
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:29,798
that look like the kentucky seeds at him

703
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:32,538
or marijuana we call it a hemp wink wink

704
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:35,298
because it's not really this high resin

705
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:36,710
plant and what they're doing in Colorado

706
00:30:35,298 --> 00:30:37,879
are about Kentucky

707
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,370
they're growing the same plants that

708
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,750
grow in California we didn't have to

709
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:44,298
worry and really some of those point

710
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:47,179
about getting to this absurd want you

711
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:50,058
know THC level making sure it leads that

712
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:51,860
know what they do is they grow a plant

713
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:54,079
said that they were grown to full

714
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:56,538
maturity would exceed that 0.3 percent

715
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,398
THC levels so they harvest the early to

716
00:30:56,538 --> 00:31:01,250
keep the THC level down unfortunately

717
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:03,648
that means you're also minimizing or

718
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,028
lessening its CBD content so in

719
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:08,839
California where you have plants that

720
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:13,460
grow 20% simply by dry weight a little

721
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:15,168
over 1% THC that's a great source for at

722
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:18,079
for CJD if you're going into harvest

723
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:20,179
Ilana it's this this will all become

724
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,069
moot because eventually these plants are

725
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,330
being bred so that you will have high

726
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:27,569
res in America

727
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:30,689
the legal definition of THC and that

728
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:33,269
that definition of 0.3 percent THC there

729
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:35,400
is no scientific basis to this this is

730
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:37,470
really kind of an absurd line that's at

731
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,110
me it's point four percent THC it's a

732
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,910
legal point three percent THC doesn't

733
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:43,919
it's just crazy and it's what it is a

734
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:47,610
way of extending coefficient in another

735
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,080
name so pharmaceutical C because it's a

736
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,309
very important developments of course

737
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,559
together pharmaceuticals at the

738
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:54,450
dielectric occurred in the United States

739
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,579
and as a pharmaceutical for treating

740
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,250
catastrophic seizure disorders surgery

741
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:00,769
and I welcome this development I think

742
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,559
this is really great I think that

743
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:07,289
whoever what whatever helps person we

744
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,240
should have access to yesterday when we

745
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:11,639
learned that the DEA has scheduled that

746
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,940
the DA that's a schedule five the lowest

747
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,400
possible the schedule schedule 6 would

748
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,799
be non-schedule schedule 1 is where

749
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,019
cannabis is leaders know whether that's

750
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:26,009
considered dangerous with no medical

751
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:29,099
value what will happen next will CBD

752
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:30,750
remove will da will move CBD for

753
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:33,089
Schedule one it's not clear they don't

754
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,849
have to because the law says anything

755
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:37,439
from the resin is illegal so they could

756
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:39,839
just say well we just followed the law

757
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,910
and that's probably what they will say

758
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:46,500
according to what we're picking up our

759
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:48,360
to the ground that this you'll have this

760
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,920
confusing legal situation that will

761
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,990
persist for a while in the United States

762
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,720
this very interesting research being

763
00:32:51,990 --> 00:33:00,089
done with single molecule CBD which has

764
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,230
shown some significant potential for

765
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:03,649
psychosis

766
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,140
Bozeman's other studies that have

767
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,880
less less clearly but in Germany this

768
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,309
but it's a very interesting research

769
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,220
that showed basically that CBD pure

770
00:33:10,308 --> 00:33:15,349
single molecule CBD was as effective as

771
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,930
the standard anti-psychotic drugs

772
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:19,639
without the harmful side effects so

773
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,350
that's an improvement right there there

774
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,059
was some recent research published at

775
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:26,539
the Elm University also looking at

776
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:29,619
schizophrenic CBD it didn't turn out

777
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:32,539
quite as well but I think there's a

778
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:34,669
compelling case to be made that single

779
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:37,039
molecule CBD even though my personal

780
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:39,050
biases toward the plant can be useful

781
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,509
it's being shown with that the dialects

782
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:43,879
and the clinical trials it yes it can be

783
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:48,170
useful it can work and we should

784
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,820
recognize that example of some other

785
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,750
interesting research the single molecule

786
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:55,399
CBD that was just presented earlier this

787
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,950
summer at the International Capital

788
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,259
Research Society graft versus host post

789
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,120
disease when you get a organ transplant

790
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:04,519
or you know sometimes a book blood

791
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,639
transfusion the often tox the body tries

792
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,099
to reject the organ in a few cases of

793
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,519
that it's usually fatal like eighty

794
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,929
percent and there's no medical

795
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:18,309
technology to help that the study that

796
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:20,780
was previewed or featured at the young

797
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:23,329
ICS conference recently showed

798
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,610
remarkable success with single molecule

799
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:27,440
CBD in preclinical work with

800
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,980
graft-versus-host so I think you know

801
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,809
anytime you can develop something has

802
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,909
any aspect of the cannabis plant that

803
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:37,320
fulfills a medical need I'll go for it

804
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:39,570
and I'm putting down my

805
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,260
favoritism toward the planet but Elsa

806
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:45,119
human being go for it that's how I feel

807
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,340
so now how do we compare pharmaceutical

808
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,070
versus artisinal CD I think they both

809
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,690
have their place but pure CBD products

810
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,550
that critical better than that is little

811
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,550
turkeys and minor cannabinoids which

812
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,950
interact with c2dm THC to enhance their

813
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,950
therapeutic benefits that's key you know

814
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:03,809
a project CBD we are not against THC all

815
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:05,909
the way to emphasize that CBD and THC

816
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:08,279
should be seen as sort of like the power

817
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:10,529
couple of cannabis therapeutics I really

818
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,560
belong together they accentuate each

819
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,910
other's medical benefits and if you're

820
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,269
using just single molecule

821
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:19,949
pharmaceutical CBD obviously the THC is

822
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:22,019
not there unless you're using the single

823
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:23,579
bottle THC which is legal in the United

824
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,739
States is a Schedule three drug as

825
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,889
Maryland

826
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:31,439
so add animal studies and anecdotal data

827
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:34,858
indicate that whole plant CBD rich oil

828
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,920
is effective at lower doses as happen as

829
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:40,380
a wider therapy window the CBD Isis do

830
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,190
you need less CBD when it's part of the

831
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,619
full cannabis matrix to be effective and

832
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,200
it's easier for it to be effective

833
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:51,809
now with single molecule CBD at least

834
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,759
some of the studies that we see it needs

835
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:55,799
to need a very high dose and a very

836
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,830
precise dose for it to be effective in

837
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,410
these studies so that's an important

838
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:03,000
comparison the other thing is with CBD

839
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:05,460
isolates that's what we see some

840
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,130
problems with drug interactions and this

841
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,720
is a portrait we just put out about CBD

842
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,710
the cannabinoid drug the drug

843
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,329
interactions

844
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,360
kind of give you the spoiler alert for

845
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:17,519
it it's a it's a lengthy report like 35

846
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,860
pages single-spaced it's a very serious

847
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,539
do you dive they took it to us because

848
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,000
we knew this is going to come up doctors

849
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:25,409
who are not involved with cannabis

850
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,829
therapeutics are going to be dealing

851
00:36:25,409 --> 00:36:30,779
with patients who are and their doctor

852
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:32,099
Senate and patients need to know this is

853
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,740
going to be any issues with drug

854
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:38,009
interactions well at sufficient doses is

855
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:41,250
the CBD will temporarily deactivate or

856
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:44,160
promote induce these cytochrome p450

857
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,619
enzymes thereby altering how we

858
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,549
metabolize a wide range of compounds

859
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:53,489
including many pharmaceuticals of THC

860
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:55,650
cytochrome p450 enzymes metabolize most

861
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:59,429
of the drugs we consume including worth

862
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:01,190
60% of market and from students meaning

863
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:05,219
that there's a potential interaction

864
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:07,050
with CBD patients on a CBD treatment

865
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:08,789
regimen should monitor changes and blood

866
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,280
levels of prescription medications that

867
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:13,949
have me adjust dosage we didn't see

868
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,440
problems with drug interactions and just

869
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:18,719
cannabis flower even I see candy kinda

870
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,269
sorry we don't see we don't know of any

871
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:24,059
problematic drug reactions with married

872
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:26,670
or pure THC why we don't take entresto

873
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:29,070
doses of a comparable illness you know

874
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:32,010
10 milligrams of THC is enough to get

875
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:34,710
should be nice and high and but with CBD

876
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:36,870
they're taking really high doses and

877
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,650
because of the dosage and that's where

878
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:41,019
you get

879
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,579
problems with the drug innovations with

880
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:44,318
CAC you know they're kind of like this

881
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:46,298
guardrails would bump into it when you

882
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:48,239
when you've taken too much THC you know

883
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:50,650
it and it's not all that much fun

884
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,189
there's a kind of dysphoria that could

885
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,829
sit in

886
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:56,289
well CBD there's no dysphoric guardrails

887
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:58,359
to tell you what you've had too much and

888
00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:00,489
because people take it in large amounts

889
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:02,650
at least in some cases that's where the

890
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:05,189
potential for drug interactions could be

891
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:08,289
problematic but drug interactions should

892
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:11,679
summation for forgo of the medications

893
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:13,480
if you're using cannabis cannabis and

894
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,219
CBD could work synergistically with

895
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,358
conventional medications but patients

896
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:18,338
need to be aware of potential

897
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:22,119
side-effects and we see it would

898
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:25,509
chemotherapy potential positive

899
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,160
interaction there if the levels of the

900
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:30,549
chemotherapy agent of being monitored

901
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:33,279
because with CBD it's if it hits the

902
00:38:30,548 --> 00:38:35,500
enzyme that metabolized or chemotherapy

903
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,329
agent the chemotherapy will stay this

904
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,130
just a blogger can accumulate that could

905
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:40,839
be very dangerous so these things have

906
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,130
to be looked at seriously we've seen

907
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:44,429
other situations with blood thinners

908
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,920
with their potential problems with

909
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:49,719
single molecule CBD therapies and for

910
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,710
people who aren't blood thinners but

911
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:55,118
it's also very easy to do

912
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:58,088
monitoring and change the levels of the

913
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,710
blood thinners if you need to so see

914
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:01,929
this is uh we're getting to the end here

915
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:06,699
city they have the crossroads Will's DEA

916
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:08,690
we schedule CBD we don't know I have a

917
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:11,250
feeling this is not going to happen

918
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,539
we have a farm bill that was supposed to

919
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,309
have been passed by them

920
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:17,940
20:18 farm bill it's been delayed

921
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:19,889
because I guess I guess they're too

922
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,340
preoccupied by putting a sexual predator

923
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:25,739
on Court sits at the farm bill right now

924
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,170
so it's a bit pushed in fact a couple of

925
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,849
months and this farm bill would legalize

926
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,860
would greet the United States if the

927
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:34,079
family of Nations and legalize the

928
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,380
growth of industrial hemp for among

929
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,360
other things biomass to extract CBD drum

930
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,610
but what happens after that

931
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,960
that guy's confusing there's gonna be a

932
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,349
lot of heavy weight winkworth

933
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,929
United States there are years or Oregon

934
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:50,579
Kentucky Vermont Montana is the state

935
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:53,519
that's going to really emerge as the big

936
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:56,610
city to Penn State in the United States

937
00:39:53,519 --> 00:40:00,449
entity I think one of the problems with

938
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:04,289
the focus on the CBD from harvesting the

939
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:07,589
Iraqi oil and the regulatory privileges

940
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:09,869
of single molecule CBD is that it kind

941
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,789
of pushes things in a direction of look

942
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:14,369
kind of limited the limits of genetic

943
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:16,829
diversity and I returned to this whole

944
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:18,929
idea of those type 2 plants that we were

945
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:21,869
discovering early on ten years ago that

946
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:24,059
were so interesting and wonderful they

947
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:25,289
kind of just sort of fall off the fault

948
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,119
of the ways that people aren't really

949
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:31,619
focusing on them very much because this

950
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:34,380
is such a strong push for CBD CBD and I

951
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:37,739
think that that whole you know what's

952
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,079
happening with the legalization of

953
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:42,959
industrial hemp will result in a kind of

954
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,360
mono cropping for CBD and that which is

955
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,699
our limits it's not a direction I think

956
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,530
you want to go it really but certainly

957
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:51,679
you want to grow a lot of place for CBD

958
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:54,030
but I don't want

959
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,279
losing the genetic diversity we have

960
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,170
what we do have a set of promiscuous

961
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,760
interbreeding would you led us to

962
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:03,750
rediscover the CBD strengths in the

963
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,450
first place so see video if really if it

964
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,130
turns out that CBD is becomes legal in

965
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:10,289
the United States

966
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,119
the rest of the planet isn't it which i

967
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:13,529
think is a really stupid way to go

968
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,279
though people think that some people

969
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:20,519
think as well and one step at a time

970
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:22,560
incrementally you gets you in the

971
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,900
cannabis prohibition but I think with

972
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,539
CBD Ellen you have a legal quagmire

973
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,880
so you bro just real happy you grow up

974
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:31,739
for violation extract the oil and

975
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,019
concentrated when you concentrate the

976
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:36,149
extraction it raises the level of what's

977
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:40,590
in there so if you start out with a

978
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:43,800
plant that's ten percent DVD and maybe

979
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:46,590
0.2 percent THC so it's legally

980
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,269
industrial hemp you concentrated both

981
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:51,300
the levels will increase so that you'll

982
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:53,400
have more than 0.3 percent THC your your

983
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,260
concentrate so that means that the

984
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,510
product make will then have to remove

985
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,090
some of the THC to bring that product to

986
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,820
market so somewhere along the process

987
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,019
they're breaking federal and state law

988
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,400
so that's what you're gonna have as a

989
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:06,150
result of what it's going to be a legal

990
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,789
quagmire

991
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,800
I don't think CBD only is really

992
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:12,719
workable intensive enforcing it here

993
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,390
either in theory or practice but that's

994
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,369
what we have quality you know and it's

995
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:19,500
not what people because you know it's

996
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:22,259
built on a lot the controlled substance

997
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,570
of that is built on a mountain of Lies

998
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:29,900
marijuana prohibition is is there it's a

999
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:32,220
racist policy it's it and I compare

1000
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,200
ongoing marijuana prohibition to the

1001
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:36,629
Confederate mustachios still standing

1002
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:40,639
it's there it's ugly it should be put in

1003
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,640
a museum and the same thing with

1004
00:42:51,849 --> 00:43:00,829
ten years ago the drive toward marijuana

1005
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:02,840
legalization motivating factor was

1006
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:05,989
really the social justice so people

1007
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,750
should be unjustly discriminated against

1008
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:11,029
in jail so forth we know it's the lowest

1009
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:14,750
target against that regard since the

1010
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:17,930
get-go so that has the driving force

1011
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,909
initially for legalization justice now

1012
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:22,869
the driving force is business and that's

1013
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:25,009
different it's it's it's a big change

1014
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,779
one doesn't have to comment on the

1015
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:29,780
change really but but it's just a change

1016
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:33,230
and we should be aware so finally take

1017
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,690
home messages vilified either holistic

1018
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:38,719
herbal medicine or modern medicine is

1019
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:41,389
not helpful both approaches are valuable

1020
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:43,849
people are best served by having access

1021
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:46,069
to a wide range of cannabinoids that can

1022
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:48,500
have a base therapeutic options and

1023
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,480
regulatory policy should not privilege

1024
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,250
single molecule cannabinoids over a

1025
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,119
whole planet cannabis retina and

1026
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:59,150
remedies so finally those more

1027
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,980
information projects CBD work is a lot

1028
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:03,769
of resources there smoke signals my book

1029
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,360
and finally thanks to counter crack with

1030
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:08,239
it which is a cannabis is this in

1031
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:12,260
California that supports some of our

1032
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:15,609
work at project CBD is a picture of

1033
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,610
hemorrhage and that's why

1034
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,670
[Applause]

1041
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:07,108
