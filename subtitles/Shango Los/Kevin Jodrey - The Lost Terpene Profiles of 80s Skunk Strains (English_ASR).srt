Hey Shengo from the shaping of fire

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,400
podcast

3
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:07,349
I want to thank Kevin Jody wonderland

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,070
nursery and the ganje for sharing this

5
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:12,388
video with us this is part 1 of 2 part 2

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,990
is going to come out later on this week

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:20,129
we're gonna add the link at that time

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:23,250
right here so you're pricing it now in

9
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:27,419
this video Kevin considers late 80s

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,948
really loud and skunky terpene profiles

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,560
that we found in weed then that have

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,840
gone away because during the times

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,179
people were getting busted and they

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,629
needed to have their you know weed smell

15
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:42,479
more you know fruity and floral than

16
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:44,429
dankey and skunky and so he wants to

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,619
come back to that so in this video he

18
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:49,259
discusses the terpene profiles that are

19
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:52,828
generally associated with really loud

20
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,030
strains from that time you know if

21
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,649
you're if you're interested in hearing

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,469
more from Kevin I recommend that you

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,890
check out the other shaping fire podcast

24
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,618
interview I did with him in 2017 all

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,650
about the early origins of the CBD

26
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,719
strains that started in California you

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,478
can find that out at the link here or

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,629
you can just go to the shaping fire calm

29
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:18,629
web site while you're there if you are

30
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:21,209
into terpenes make sure that you listen

31
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,000
to the interview I did with Ben from

32
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,618
true terpenes as well all about terpenes

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,500
and how they're used in your everyday

34
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,969
life and you know if you are into

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,909
terpenes and you want to buy some for

36
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,920
yourself or to use in production for a

37
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,140
product that you're making make sure you

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,969
go to this link to go to troupe to

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,469
Europeans and pick up some terpenes

40
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:43,200
because they're the ones who sponsor our

41
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,379
channel so thanks to Kevin and

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,180
Wonderland and the GaN GA and true

43
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,298
terpenes for all the support all right

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,630
here we go this is Kevin Wonderland I

45
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,030
was spending some time trying to take a

46
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,218
look better at the older strains from

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,790
late 80s early 90s which is to me is a

48
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:05,489
sweet spot of cannabis that it was this

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,780
incredible amount of varietals that

50
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:11,250
pooled to make those those varietals and

51
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:15,210
they were the only ones taken

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,669
out of play not due to obsolescence but

53
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,379
more to the fact that they were two

54
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,659
highly recognizable and something that I

55
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,729
call BC and that's before charcoal

56
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:26,159
so before choco filtration was really

57
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:29,209
prevalent and allowed individuals to

58
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,500
hide cannabis in discreet situations

59
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,270
some of these varietals from that time

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,580
period primarily what we call skunks

61
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:40,080
we're so well known to the scent that it

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,969
was an instant indicator that there was

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,950
cannabis being produced at this location

64
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,770
and so it completely took these strains

65
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:48,799
out and I've been going back in time to

66
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,689
dig through to repol this population out

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,890
because the the varietals were built at

68
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:59,939
that time for totally enjoyment from the

69
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:01,979
user's perspective and some of these

70
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,599
scents have been have been lost and it's

71
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,669
trying to mine them and find out where

72
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,859
they exist and so I've been working with

73
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,169
this strain called the hog out of San

74
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,730
Diego for a little while and it's a

75
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:17,219
beautiful skunk afghani combination and

76
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:18,629
the the the genetics that make it up go

77
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,919
back to that time this might have been

78
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:26,269
made you know 2025 years ago so a little

79
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:30,298
little later than where I'm speaking but

80
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:32,730
the the precursors the plants have made

81
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,260
it up combined and did this and so we

82
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:37,709
did an interest in test this year where

83
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:40,590
we ran a humic acid mix from a company

84
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,140
as a test to see what it would do on

85
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,599
production and when I ran all the Turpin

86
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,839
alysus I had the very analytics my lab

87
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,599
but I've used from the inception run my

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,430
trip profiles and so what I find which

89
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,889
was so interesting was that they had

90
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,099
some very extreme variances in in a one

91
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,779
specific area but the overall smell was

92
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,489
identical to the user you couldn't

93
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,759
differentiate between the two flowers

94
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,909
even though one of them was 1% campign

95
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,340
and the other one was 1% told pining

96
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:13,229
Alpha and Beta Pi means combined and one

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,269
of them is pining spine and the other

98
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:16,889
camphor is more of an herbal and so it

99
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,048
was amazing to me as I started to look

100
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,180
at these and try to understand from a

101
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,769
Terp profile analysis what the smell

102
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,500
really was and what was really taking

103
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:26,079
place

104
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,620
and so I started to wonder where does

105
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,199
the smell garlic come from in in garlic

106
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,030
and why does this flower of the hog have

107
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,430
such a heavy garlic odor so I went

108
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:38,439
through the basic dirt profiles and we

109
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,449
had you know alpha pioneer alpha pioneer

110
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,189
which of Heinz we had and then in the

111
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,170
and then and then the flip sample was it

112
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:48,129
had nope I need had caffeine but

113
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,000
basically the same level about 1% and so

114
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:50,259
that was really the only major

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,329
difference in the two and then Mayor

116
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,399
scene was dominant we had limonene which

117
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:56,199
is in mere scenes of Earth's and mosques

118
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,899
and lye meanings as citruses and we have

119
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,629
Lin aloo which is a spicy floral Finchel

120
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:04,479
which is a camphor Kaurava lean which is

121
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:07,839
a hoppy peppery humulin which is earthy

122
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,490
woody that we went into some of these

123
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,039
lighter ones which was a valance scene

124
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,340
which is an orange and then farness

125
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,620
scene which is woody trans neurology all

126
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:21,909
citrus apple roads near allah dog

127
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:24,490
barking woody and then a growl all I

128
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,650
can't really pronounce the word GU a IOL

129
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,120
and that's piney and so I took a look

130
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:31,089
and these were the major Terps that made

131
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,459
up what we talked about and I started to

132
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:35,439
do some research and I start trying to

133
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:37,299
find out where is this smell or that we

134
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,310
call like funky death and where does

135
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,629
these things come from and I started to

136
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,470
take a look and I started to find out

137
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:46,029
that farness scene which is farness all

138
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,400
is the precursor to all cesspit are

139
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:52,209
beans but farness seen the the Terp

140
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:55,779
itself is the death smell of aphids and

141
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:58,479
so plants exude that smell to drive

142
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,879
predation away from it because it smells

143
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,060
like insect death and then if a fits die

144
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,180
they release that odor which then tells

145
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,060
other athens that their death is present

146
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,250
and they should hide and so it started

147
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,780
to it drives some interest in terms of

148
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,189
you know are we picking up some of these

149
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:18,159
funky tones that are really bio

150
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:20,469
protectants and we're interpreting them

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,480
in a way that makes us perceive

152
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,300
something and so I started to take a

153
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,419
look at this and we started to go

154
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,069
through and we took a look and we'd find

155
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:31,990
that Jarrin Hall is the precursor for

156
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,490
all the mono Terps and farnesyl is the

157
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,370
precursor for all the sesqui Terps

158
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,939
and I started to take a look and trying

159
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,319
to understand you know what are what are

160
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,639
some of the reasons why this stuff works

161
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,810
why do we have some of these smells and

162
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:50,439
we've been talking about esters which

163
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:53,478
are alcohols and we find that you have

164
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,189
alcohols that are glycerides and glasses

165
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:58,399
Rides

166
00:06:54,189 --> 00:07:00,168
are makeup fat and so almost all fats

167
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,870
and animals and plants are from

168
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:05,779
glycerides and that is from esters and

169
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,970
so we start to say as we go back we

170
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:09,888
always remember the sticky the oily the

171
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,090
greasy things that we don't see as much

172
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,810
anymore things that don't have the same

173
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:17,089
tactical fields same constituents that

174
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,339
make it up and and some of those things

175
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:20,929
I think are directly connected and so I

176
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,418
started to take a little look deeper and

177
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,629
as I started to go into this I started

178
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:28,939
to find that things like Valentin which

179
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,889
is orange which you can smell so clearly

180
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:33,620
in this you don't smell citrus in the

181
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,598
sense of lemon-lime through your hog

182
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,300
flour but you if you give it a squeeze

183
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,579
you're gonna have this our garlic and

184
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,800
you're gonna have this underlying citrus

185
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:45,139
tone but you can smell a distinct orange

186
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,090
over a lemon or lime and you have a

187
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,129
muskiness that typically would come from

188
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:51,529
mere scene but when you look at the

189
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:54,408
profile of a hog and an OG limonene

190
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,149
Mayer seen pining and we'll use the

191
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:58,098
pining sample instead of the camping

192
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:59,779
because like I said they smelled

193
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:01,959
identical when you compared them but for

194
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:05,209
OG Kush which is typically we would say

195
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:07,129
limonene piney mersin dominant it

196
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:09,829
couldn't be any different than the hog

197
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,718
and they both have similar profiles and

198
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:13,399
so I started going through this and I

199
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:15,050
started trying to understand better what

200
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,859
makes these things happen because we all

201
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,629
become very Terp aware but they're they

202
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,669
work in combination in conjunction with

203
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:24,079
each other and there's also conversions

204
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:27,250
and what I started to find was the

205
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:30,918
valence scene which is this incredibly

206
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,629
Valencia orange smell they take Valentin

207
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:35,538
and how to write this down so I get the

208
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:38,299
name straight but you can use bacteria

209
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:40,098
and they do this in perfume industry and

210
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:44,419
other industries and they use a bacteria

211
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:47,089
and it converts Vallon scene to a newt

212
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:50,269
Cottone and so a newt cotone is the

213
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:52,100
was valuable of all grapefruit Terps

214
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:55,578
and so this incredibly valuable

215
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:59,300
grapefruit Center can be converted from

216
00:08:55,578 --> 00:09:01,188
valence scene biologically and so I

217
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:03,828
started to take a look at you know what

218
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:06,259
is what is garlic and why do we smell it

219
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:10,338
and why do we do and garlic is something

220
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:12,169
called an allison ester al Li CIN and it

221
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,449
doesn't release its smell

222
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:16,429
until you crush it but it's not because

223
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:18,378
you volatize dit as much as you've

224
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:21,620
crushed it and you've released enzymes

225
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:24,350
which then reacts and go to process and

226
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,539
then release this so there's all these

227
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,240
things that are taking place in how we

228
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:30,769
perceive smells and tones and when we're

229
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,448
looking at Terp reports and tert

230
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,379
profiles and i'm gonna go through a

231
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,578
bunch of these i'm gonna go through a

232
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,528
lot of these older over the next couple

233
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:37,729
of weeks as I get a chance I'll go

234
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,019
through some of these profiles

235
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,959
pertaining to some of these older

236
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,339
varieties I'm sifting through and what

237
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,409
it'll do is it'll let us kind of take a

238
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,029
look at what's a chart profile compared

239
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:49,188
to what's the actual strain what do we

240
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:52,480
really smell and when we look at these

241
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:55,159
things where do we not see these odors

242
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,199
meaning that I should see with all the

243
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,208
pines and Earth's I should see a lot

244
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:01,818
more in this thing but really what I

245
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:04,549
have is a sour funk a garlicky tone and

246
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:05,778
underlying orange and a little bit of

247
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:09,248
earth and it would make sense because we

248
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:11,870
have so many earthy Terps present but

249
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:13,610
the irony was when I started to compare

250
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,438
all these profiles I started to see such

251
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,789
similarities between things that we have

252
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:19,698
now and things that we had in the past

253
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:21,349
and it's primarily these alcohols that

254
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:22,818
make these differences in the strains

255
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,589
that were from the past and now that we

256
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:26,990
know that these esters are directly

257
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:30,050
related to the fat production in plants

258
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,698
and animals this thing starts to make

259
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:34,128
sense because we remember these strains

260
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:36,109
being so sticky and so greasy and we

261
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:40,039
assumed sticky from resins but perhaps

262
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:42,139
sticky from fats and so as we mine back

263
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,958
through these older strains and go dig

264
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:46,490
through these profiles I'll go and take

265
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,109
a look through the tert profiles and

266
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,938
we'll start to try to understand better

267
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,539
what are we looking at and a lot of it

268
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:55,219
is so that we can understand what makes

269
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:56,808
it attractive and what doesn't otherwise

270
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,910
it's just basically these simple

271
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:59,778
profiles of this this and this drive and

272
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:03,230
attraction this

273
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:07,429
and this give us a desire total amounts

274
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:10,249
solely dictate desirability and in a lot

275
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:12,649
of cases it's just not true and it

276
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:14,089
becomes confusing and misleading to us

277
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,708
in terms of production and when people

278
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,389
start to look at cannabinoid profiles

279
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,948
and then interpret early profiles and

280
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:21,438
that becomes the the basis of their

281
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:23,359
decision making process it's not

282
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:24,679
necessarily very accurate in terms of

283
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,230
how we perceive it through the mouth and

284
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,088
through the nose and so I spent some

285
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,459
time just over the Christmas break

286
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,930
having a few minutes to hang out and I

287
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,219
just went through and listed this stuff

288
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:37,159
and went through and started trying to

289
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,778
understand you know why do we have some

290
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:42,110
of these odors that we do and why do we

291
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:43,490
not and try to understand the subtleties

292
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,289
in it because it's always the subtlety

293
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,999
that determines quality it's not gross

294
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:49,639
characteristics it's always the fine

295
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:51,740
details both cars of cars they both get

296
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,680
you from point A to B one of them has a

297
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,438
better experience and so we would

298
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:59,539
typically consider that the better car

299
00:11:56,438 --> 00:12:01,429
it's the same with cannabis whichever

300
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:03,769
one gives you the best experience how

301
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,929
you perceive it what it does for you in

302
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:08,240
terms of medical usage spiritual usage

303
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:10,219
however we want to define it but all

304
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,159
those characteristics are from

305
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,620
perception and when it comes to smell

306
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:17,838
we're so nuanced through the nose it's

307
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,159
such a direct connection from brains

308
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,959
brainstem to nostril that it it's primal

309
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,028
it goes all the way back and so we've

310
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:28,308
been keyed to smell and understand so

311
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:30,828
many things but with cannabis

312
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:32,838
we've been necked into some populations

313
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:35,120
now and there's this drive to bring out

314
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,790
higher louder strains and louder just

315
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,558
meaning more visible to the nostril

316
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:41,539
quickly which means more aromatic at

317
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:45,308
room temperature so that's more volatile

318
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:49,698
so that's more monoterpene derived and

319
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:52,100
we have so many these varietals now that

320
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:54,139
we're working in those directions but

321
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,480
ultimately is it is it giving you an

322
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:58,870
enjoyable experience and does it give

323
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,699
you the effect that you desire from that

324
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,169
Terr profile and a lot of the

325
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,729
information when you get into terpenes

326
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:06,948
is by protectants on how it affects

327
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,709
against tumors and cancer and bone loss

328
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:11,508
and tooth decay and I mean it's

329
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,739
unlimited what you can do with this but

330
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:13,000
the

331
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,519
none of this has been studied in a

332
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,950
smokeable form always in applied to a

333
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,740
thing it doesn't really apply to us in

334
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,690
the same way it's it's extrapolating

335
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,490
data from one set and putting it on

336
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,750
another and kind of pretending that it's

337
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,509
accurate and we really know that's not

338
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,889
the case and it's really more a matter

339
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,950
of trying to understand how do you

340
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:35,289
interpret the the cannabinoid profiles

341
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,060
the turpenoid profiles and also these

342
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:38,889
esters these alcohols that was so

343
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:41,349
dominant and present in these cannabis

344
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:43,840
varieties from the past that released

345
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,149
such an incredible smell that was so

346
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,440
distinctive to all people that

347
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:51,669
eventually these varieties had to get

348
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,380
removed from the system and so it's this

349
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:55,959
understanding that I'm trying to find as

350
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:58,629
to what drove such an incredible desire

351
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,879
in cannabis from those types and how do

352
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:04,659
we get back into some of those exotic

353
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:07,360
forms of cannabinoid combinations and

354
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:08,500
terpenoid alcohol combinations so that

355
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,419
we can get back into some of that

356
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,000
desirability on a different direction

357
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:14,469
and it's we're not working the same

358
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,080
populations that we're working which are

359
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,529
primarily right now with so much of the

360
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,360
og directions and I was just so

361
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,889
fascinated with because if we when we

362
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,570
talk about you know the mere seen piney

363
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,480
limonene where it's uplifting and then

364
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,860
brings you down the hog strains skunk

365
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,480
strains couldn't be any could be any

366
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,629
opposite in terms of where they lift you

367
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,090
up but they don't bring you down they

368
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,740
don't have that same type of sedative

369
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,620
effect even though the mere seen level

370
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,539
and this is relatively high it's you

371
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,919
know double the pines even more than the

372
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:47,169
crow Faline levels the only thing that

373
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:50,679
the the hog had that was really high was

374
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:52,509
trans and neural Adal and CIS Nala doll

375
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,639
and so between the two of them you were

376
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:56,639
looking at almost you know four four and

377
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,980
a half percent and that's citrusy Apple

378
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,899
rose that's barking woody and all these

379
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,450
complex tones that come into these

380
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:07,889
varieties that make them taste so so

381
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,030
green and green meaning you know

382
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:12,549
subtleties of the of the earth and the

383
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:15,250
forest within and we can pull out some

384
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:16,779
specific little pieces and I would say

385
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,789
you know you have some hoppy taste and

386
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,759
some wheatgrass or some lemongrass

387
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:24,279
present of that beautiful subtle orange

388
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,679
tone Mir seen is always this this

389
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,230
the component that when we crush this

390
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,829
and volatility volatility we can get it

391
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:35,080
to come out but so much of it is is in

392
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,660
my mind now as I see that we're having

393
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,650
biological conversions of alcohols to

394
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:43,839
other substances we're having enzymatic

395
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:46,449
conversions of something to something so

396
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,720
if garlic is an enzymatic conversion to

397
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,790
a scent then maybe we need to rethink

398
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,399
how we approach the smell components of

399
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:55,899
cannabis and I'm not a terpene scientist

400
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
I'm just fortunate enough to get to

401
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,159
listen to them frequently but I'm

402
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,159
somebody who's trying to understand

403
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:05,799
where is the the desire in cannabis

404
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,689
where do people like to go when it comes

405
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:11,229
to cannabis where is the directions of

406
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,510
cannabis and this entire population from

407
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,019
that you know that late Atle 90 time

408
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:20,470
period prior to really smell BC before

409
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,090
charcoal all of that was this incredible

410
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,430
cannabis population that was still

411
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,649
globally developed meaning that though

412
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,059
the world had produced all this

413
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:30,490
different cannabis varieties and they

414
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:33,849
had been clustered into these cannabis

415
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,620
zones and those zones of production

416
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,170
created these varieties and then lo and

417
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,299
behold as we go forward the demand of

418
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:42,759
the customer drives what people have but

419
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,109
black market forced some radical changes

420
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,480
because there was a limit in what

421
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,430
cannabis was available and cannabis that

422
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,800
was coming over at that time from say

423
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:53,019
the remnants of Colombia the remnants of

424
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,139
Mexico that cannabis was so much lower

425
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:58,179
quality than the indoor produced in

426
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,799
California that even though the end are

427
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:01,559
from California had these reduced snow

428
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,338
rates because we had turned them down

429
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,990
you still received a better

430
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:06,818
higher-quality product than what was

431
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,849
available so the market became

432
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:12,279
accustomed to that and then as we start

433
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,659
to go into medical marijuana and move

434
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,399
forward all of a sudden we had the

435
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,439
ability to produce cannabis again in a

436
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,939
protected manner which allowed us then

437
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,730
to have cannabis that was inherently

438
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:24,600
louder more distinct a higher signature

439
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,759
and that

440
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,409
brought the awareness back of hey

441
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,049
where's all this good smelly stuff we

442
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,700
had when we were younger and so we we go

443
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,619
back and we realize we've necked all

444
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,779
these things out and so I've been on

445
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:39,869
this hunt to pull stuff from that time

446
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,399
period back from globally and try to

447
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:43,289
locate these varieties so that we could

448
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,360
go into them and start to say what

449
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:48,720
creates these smells really we're all

450
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,669
looking for the skunk pee but the we and

451
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,380
we want it but we want the skunk pee on

452
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,789
a better chassis the skunk pee that

453
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,070
we're so caught up with in terms of

454
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:57,599
skunk it was always on the leafiest

455
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:59,189
cabbagey looking stuff you have ever

456
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,889
seen in your life it was never on really

457
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,420
solid flour it's very very rarely

458
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:07,080
primarily and a different type of

459
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,060
morphological bud characteristic and so

460
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:10,710
I don't know if I'm so much seeking to

461
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,720
go back but I'm going to seek into those

462
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,950
tones because it was also stunning

463
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,779
other varietals the burnt rubbers the

464
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,610
the heavy citrus pines that were just

465
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:23,069
dominant you don't see any of that

466
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:25,679
anymore not to the same degree no og is

467
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:27,809
piney like strains that were piney and

468
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,170
we just don't see them they're moderated

469
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:32,759
something's controlling these these

470
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:36,120
connections on how you perceive it and

471
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,410
so I think that as we go forward and we

472
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,629
start to dig and look through the

473
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,430
reports and then take a look at the

474
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,690
cannabis and actually consume and test

475
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,580
and say hey what are we seeing what

476
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,860
don't we see it starts to become very

477
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:49,409
informative because when I had two

478
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,659
samples run that were almost identical

479
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,029
in almost all characteristics little

480
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,460
fluctuations but in piney and kam Fein

481
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:58,889
no camping in one no pining and the

482
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,059
other but you couldn't put the you could

483
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,950
put the fly was in the same container

484
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,509
and no one could tell the difference so

485
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,769
it started to really make me realize you

486
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:08,250
know that some of these things that are

487
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:11,160
so characteristically known are either

488
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,589
subdued or enhanced by other terpenes

489
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,009
and what alcohols are present and the

490
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:18,449
degree that the alcohol is present and

491
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:20,129
that would be from a lot of it from the

492
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,779
the growing conditions the inputs

493
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,950
obviously because it changed profiles

494
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:27,269
here and you know your harvest time and

495
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,460
the curing windows and all these

496
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:30,809
different pieces that control it but

497
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,100
it's gonna be interesting as we go

498
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,929
forward because we're gonna start to be

499
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:35,730
able to take a look at profiles and

500
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,840
start to find some really interesting

501
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,548
markers

502
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,470
so that when we get into breeding and

503
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:42,569
we're able to start to mark for some of

504
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,240
these terpene indicators and look

505
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:47,220
through genetically do we have these

506
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,929
markers we should be able to start to go

507
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,058
back into some of these plants that were

508
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:55,169
extremely high in these volatile esters

509
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:57,538
and alcohols which are exceptionally

510
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:59,009
attractive but very hard to mine you

511
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:02,069
want seed and concentrates because of

512
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:03,599
the volatility and it just starts to

513
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:05,128
help us understand better what it is

514
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,230
we're producing what it is we're trying

515
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:09,118
to market to the public and when people

516
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,399
want you know unique varieties it's

517
00:20:09,118 --> 00:20:15,388
unique because why what what defines

518
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:19,439
unique and so much of this is being able

519
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:21,689
to take your varietals and say they're

520
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,869
unique because people like them for this

521
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:28,590
it has an applicability here there's a

522
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:29,878
demand for it this way not just it has a

523
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:31,490
higher content than others because

524
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:33,599
ultimately that doesn't really

525
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,368
numerically it does make a difference on

526
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,918
a shelf but in terms of how people

527
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:39,720
perceive it radically different and so

528
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,190
when I spent the last you know half a

529
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,778
day trying to understand where's the

530
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,090
smell of garlic coming from when I don't

531
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:47,190
have any garlic terpenes or alcohols

532
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:49,349
present in the testing and we're only

533
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,230
looking at a truncated test it might be

534
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:54,388
say like 30 and there might be over 200

535
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,110
possible but those will be at levels

536
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:59,579
that would be so small it's it's

537
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:01,528
catalyst things that change things

538
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,898
things that precursors things that set

539
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:05,579
things in motion and so as we go forward

540
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:07,859
and we start to really have a more

541
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:09,449
in-depth test and we're able to look at

542
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:10,888
this a little different we'll be able to

543
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,538
start going in and moving some of these

544
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:15,868
populations in these directions I

545
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:17,908
believe and for me right now it's just a

546
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:20,788
fascinating time to be able to see this

547
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:22,379
and do this and actually have the chance

548
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:24,808
to understand what made some of these

549
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:26,908
things so attractive versus just had a

550
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:28,200
smell that was this because we have her

551
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:29,190
having a hell of a time trying to

552
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
replicate it

553
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,389
if skunk was easy to replicate you would

554
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,278
see terpene blenders blending it and it

555
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:37,288
would be present as a Terp to add the

556
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:40,470
things but I don't see skunk piss on

557
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:42,298
anything right now period so I know that

558
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,759
some of these things are exceptionally

559
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,378
hard to capture or create and it's what

560
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,839
made some of these varieties so

561
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:49,849
attractive and that's what that's what's

562
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,509
fun right now is we get

563
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:55,819
to hunt and do so the hog you you got me

564
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:57,440
curious because your smell is unique and

565
00:21:55,819 --> 00:22:00,710
I for the life of me could not figure

566
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,240
out where it came from so thanks thanks

567
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,298
we attracted me so much that I put the

568
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,579
effort in and I hope this video signs a

569
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:09,548
little light on the chase of where these

570
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:12,319
things come from and remember I'm not

571
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:14,720
organic chemist and I don't claim to be

572
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,149
one and nor do I want to be one but I'm

573
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,819
someone who's fascinated with genetics

574
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,190
and what makes something desirable and

575
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:23,928
in these things we start to have

576
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,820
desirability just like when we look in

577
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:26,990
in cannabinoid profiles we can start to

578
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:29,149
find out that these cannabinoids

579
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,429
influence the way the body accepts other

580
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,140
cannabinoids and it directly affects how

581
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:36,919
you perceive this effect because it is

582
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,390
absolutely giving you in effect and the

583
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,280
understanding of that allows you to

584
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,690
better tailor in what you're seeking so

585
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,940
that as we move into these different

586
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,548
populations and people come in you're

587
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,320
able to give them better choices and

588
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:50,298
we're accurate choices and then they are

589
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,700
able to understand why they made the

590
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:54,769
choices which lets us drive directions

591
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,659
of breeding and plant choices towards

592
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:59,269
those directions so that we're not just

593
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:00,830
creating and hoping people like it but

594
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:02,990
we're actually marking some of these

595
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:06,889
incredibly attractive components that

596
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:09,409
individuals find attractive and figure

597
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,288
out how to apply so I hope you holiday

598
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:14,450
season went well and thanks for

599
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:17,500
listening to the vid and I hope we got

600
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,500
something positive out of it

601
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,009
you
