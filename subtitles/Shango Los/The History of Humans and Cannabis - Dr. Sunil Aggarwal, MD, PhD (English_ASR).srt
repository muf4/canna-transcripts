00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,878
place where which is traditionally set

for people to exchange farming things

54
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,239
that they've grown together and and be

55
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,159
with others socially just it was

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,560

68
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,119
homage to my mentor and friend Ethan Dr

69
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,959
Ethan Russo who without him I would not

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,039
have gotten that PhD in the University

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,799
of Washington because he was on my

72
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,000
supervisory committee so here to Ethan

73
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,080
and much of what I'm going to share with

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,840
you uh much of this information was

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,440
really not well put together and

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,719
collected uh until Ethan brusso sat down

77
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,120
and actually called it and cator

78
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:25,080
cataloged it summarized it uh for people

79
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,640
to read all around the world so this is

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,360
a this is has to be said so let's give

81
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,359
him another round of applause

82
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:39,759
it's wonderful so anyway I was very

83
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,438
nervous about speaking here but but I

84
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,199
told him please uh I don't want to get

85
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,199
any alternative facts tonight so

86
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,679
please I'm not doing

87
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,519
that so um geography is my spe medical

88
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,280
specialty or at least social science

89
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,519
specialty medical geography sub group in

90
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,959
that but in geography we've always we

91
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,759
studied human plant relationships as one

92
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,598
facet of how humans shape the

93
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:12,399
environment in planet Earth and our our

94
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,479
space and environment around us I was

95
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,759
always very interested in the concept of

96
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,639
questions about how cannabis came here

97
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,360
uh to this where this space that we all

98
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,560
occupy together uh and you know how

99
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,600
something that has was evolved on planet

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,439
Earth came to seem socially so alien uh

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,800
and so U socially you know marginalized

102
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,240
and and all that stuff demonized all the

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,879
things that that we've been dealing with

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,879
for all these just just actually Century

105
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,000
or two although if you go back in 13th

106
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,918
century there was there was attempts to

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,759
prohibit cannabis in in some parts of

108
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,918
the Muslim world at the time there world

109
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,720
but those didn't succeed so and it won't

110
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:54,079
succeed this time either but the

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,919
question I had was in those days nobody

112
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,120
ever tried to eradicate it with the

113
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,560
degree of f ferocity that the uh drug

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
enforcement Administration the United

115
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,600
States and their literal crop pulling

116
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,879
you know all that physical labor

117
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,759
involved in trying to eradicate

118
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,319
something that's wind pollinated I mean

119
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,160
you really have to really have a lot of

120
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,478
money and a lot of heart to go after

121
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,880
something that's spreads like that so

122
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:19,680
how did we get into that situation and

123
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,560
so and I'm from Oklahoma that's where

124
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,439
I'm born and raised um which had the

125
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,120
most Draconian marijuana lws in the

126
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,000
Western Hemisphere uh if you you know

127
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,319
because we aren't don't share the death

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,399
penalty uh stuff that Indonesia and

129
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,879
Malaysia and China and other places have

130
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,638
but we you know we'll put you in jaill

131
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,079
for life for growing one plant at least

132
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,439
that was on the books for a while and

133
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,038
life P life sentences were passed just a

134
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,199
few years ago signed by the current

135
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,038
governor for uh making

136
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,439
hashish so you know that's kind of hey

137
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,639
now they actually have their

138
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,719
decriminalization policies on cannabis

139
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,439
are actually more ahead of Washington

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,400
state in so in terms of their possession

141
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,839
amount that's decriminalized there still

142
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,279
it's still a very very different game

143
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,560
there and there's still a lot of ways to

144
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,198
go but uh still that's what I knew

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,079
growing up and um I really uh so in in

146
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,520
my in my body in my brain cannabis was

147
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,758
really really you know dangerous and

148
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,799
alien but anyway we know otherwise and

149
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,759
let's what I I want to share with you is

150
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,160
a little bit about what researchers uh

167
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,800
different pieces in such a nice way and

168
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,839
one thing this book does that you will

169
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
not find in many other volumes on

170
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,079
histories and geographies of cannabis is

171
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,199
it talks about the use of cannabis in

172
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,680
Africa

173
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:06,360
uh which is widely neglected area of

174
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,560
research uh and study and U it's

175
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,960
completely unusual and surprising um and

176
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,598
U kind of colonialist because smoking

177
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,680
cannabis was invented in Africa uh and

178
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:21,038
he has unequivocal evidence towards that

179
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,759
fact um when drug cannabis

180
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:27,318
cultures went from India South Asia to

181
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,598
parts of Africa that's where the smoking

182
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,598
had already been developed for other

183
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:32,360
herbs and and uh this is where he

184
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:33,439
believes that Canabis smoking began

185
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,720
which is what we were just talking about

186
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,199
a few minutes ago but um anyway that's

187
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
that's something that's really worth

188
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,439
looking at because uh we really need to

189
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,839
get our brains around actually

190
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,439
cannabis's role in uh the global

191
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,918
societies internationally and

192
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:53,319
historically uh so we can actually stake

193
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:55,318
our social Commonwealth claim towards if

194
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,439
that's my moral two cents about the

195
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,840
thing because if you don't if you if you

196
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,478
don't claim it you're going to lose it

197
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,198
that's true for any of our rights in

198
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,199
society uh and I think at this day and

199
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,319
age um everybody wants to stay a claim

200
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,759
so um but you know what can was well

201
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,759
there and around well before we even

202
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,080
enter the scene evolutionarily speaking

203
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,759
so this is what's really interesting

204
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:20,158
this evolutionary story of actually how

205
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,639
this cannabis plant came to even evolve

206
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:27,839
in the way that we come to know and L it

207
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:30,918
uh so it all starts on um in the

208
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:34,639
primordial uh land Mass called

209
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:37,278
laasia before the Indian subcontinent

210
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,038
crashed into through plate tectonics

211
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,639
collided into with the Asian land Mach

212
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,559
that was a cont called laasia and that

213
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,600
is actually where we believe uh the

214
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,838
ancestral Canabis and the central part

215
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,680
of that where it evolved began to grow

216
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,560
uh and what's really interesting is that

217
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,319
it was really the due to the

218
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,278
interactions of that ancestral cannabis

219
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,879
with the physical environment that it

220
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:06,240
was in I elevation climate um exposure

221
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,039
to the sun uh this is how the different

222
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,039
varieties of cannabis that we know in

223
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,480
two major categories developed and this

224
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,159
is what this is what the prevailing

225
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,560
theories are in geology and geography of

226
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,078
Canabis so what happened was uh this is

227
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,078
kind of in between the time of the

228
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:25,399
evolution of this of nettles and hops

229
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:27,399
these are the two plants that are most

230
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,078
closely related on either side to this

231
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,440
Canabis plant and we're talking about

232
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:37,039
somewhere in a range of 30 plus million

233
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,800
years ago uh you know humans are I don't

234
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,360
know some some hominids we go couple

235
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,399
Mill two million you know so we're going

236
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,039
way back before before any of that stuff

237
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:50,639
was going on um so uh Nettles originated

238
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,360
about 55 million years ago and humulus

239
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,958
or hops distinguish itself six and a

240
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,120
half million years ago so somewhere in

241
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:01,879
that window is where cannabis's window

242
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,360
uh so in that area of Central Asia that

243
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,639
landscape um there was there was there

244
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
was some Highlands over there but they

245
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,480
weren't that high in elevation uh but

246
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,360
what what started to happen is that you

247
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,560
know due to the the movement of the

248
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,240
Earth's plates this Asia Indian land

249
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,039
mass began to collide with with the land

250
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,360
mass of Asia and those cannabis plants

251
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,919
uh became exposed to increasingly higher

252
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,399
elevations over a period of millions of

253
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,360
millions of years uh this is a very

254
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,000
disruptive event in the history of

255
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,000
planet Earth uh it it led to the

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,759
creation of the largest uh landlocked

257
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,559
area of land on planet Earth that whole

258
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,120
Central Asia area there was no there

259
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:46,638
wasi prior to that those many of those

260
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,039
places had exposure to Ocean but no

261
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,240
longer this had huge impacts on climate

262
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:56,439
uh devel led to the evolution of the

263
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,320
monsoon uh and um this plant uh it sort

264
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,040
of caused a separation of two different

265
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,639
varieties two different separate areas

266
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,639
of uh Evolution for Canabis one that was

267
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,560
in the area of what we now know as the

268
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,720
Hindu Kush mountains uh in Western

269
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:16,039
Himalayas and one that was further to

270
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,079
the north of I can't remember T and

271
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,838
Islands there's some area in that in

272
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,159
that part little closer to the North

273
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
further to the

274
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:25,639
north and uh what's what's really

275
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,319
interesting is that what we know and

276
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,519
what we know is that uh as cannabis uh

277
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,480
became more exposed to higher elevations

278
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,720
in lower latitudes UVB radiation becomes

279
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,039
more prevalent it's just a it's just a

280
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,000
fact of life if you're going to survive

281
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,078
in high Highland areas you're going to

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,559
have to be exposed to the Sun and UV

283
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:48,039
radiation can detoxic to your DNA it can

284
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,119
cause DNA damage which can lead to uh

285
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,439
mutations which can be toxic or

286
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,480
unhealthy and that kind of things so you

287
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,200
have to develop a survival mechanism and

288
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,000
that's one Theory as to why we think

289
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,079
that abundance of cannabinoids became

290
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,759
began to be developed the ecological

291
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,559
explanation to word off insects and

292
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,679
things like that people don't think that

293
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,159
that explains fully enough how much you

294
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,599
know what this was involved for and we

295
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,519
can talk separately about why this

296
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,120
particular class of compounds and not

297
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,360
other compounds tpes uh also have

298
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,720
interesting properties to when they are

299
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,519
aromatized they can seed clouds um like

300
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,399
Pine lemine and this cloud cover can

301
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,720
also help to prevent you know sun

302
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,240
exposure as we all know in the Northwest

303
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,920
so that is another thing going on but uh

304
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,560
this is kind of a big moment and then

305
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,958
the other the Cannabis stands that were

306
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:41,159
further to the north um what happened

307
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,119
there uh there was another like there

308
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,958
was different ages and shifts in the in

309
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,560
the glacial ages that were now the pesto

310
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,479
scene era and between two interglacial

311
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,439
periods uh people talk about cannabis

312
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,480
really had to become a little bit more

313
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,079
into the grasslands into the plains

314
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,639
areas to survive in that area and more

315
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,759
closer to rivers

316
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,639
uh which is different from what was

317
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,720
going on in the South further south

318
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,839
which was more into the mountainous

319
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,759
regions uh so this kind of created two

320
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,320
separate

321
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:16,679
evolutionary environmental pressures um

322
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,320
and nowadays I mean and it was Dr Russo

323
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,439
who first showed this to me uh genetics

324
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,480
is what we use to try to distinguish our

325
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,440
cannabis species to figure out you know

326
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,519
in dogs we can say what's a Chihuahua

327
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,639
and what's a Doberman just by looking at

328
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,799
it but but cannabis was always such a

329
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,600
thing where you really had to get close

330
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,240
up close and personal at least humans

331
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,199
did to find out what's what uh and that

332
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,839
really perplexed and Confused people for

333
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,399
hundreds and hundreds of years uh Bist

334
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,839
and everything not everyone was exposed

335
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,360
and people saw cannabis they would call

336
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,600
it one thing because they reminded them

337
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,440
of their cord plant you know and it

338
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,040
turned out to be a drug plant vice versa

339
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,480
so it's all confusing but Dr Carl Hill's

340
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:59,919
uh genetic analysis really tried to show

341
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,639
that there probably are two distinct

342
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,039
species and maybe this is the origin of

343
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,278
that distinction and I know we and we've

344
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,198
allten used these terms Inda sativa and

345
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,198
there's there's folk uses of Inda and

346
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,758
sativa there's technical uses of Inda

347
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:15,919
and sativa and who knows it's all very

348
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,600
and then of course there was a period

349
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,759
where there was people talked about

350
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,959
ruderalis um but I think all of these

351
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,399
things um are you really have to just

352
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,838
look at it from a historical Evolution

353
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,159
standpoint there was one ancestral

354
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,800
cannabis they do interbreed um but U

355
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,679
this is how

356
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,799
arose now um the other part of this

357
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,799
story is domestication of course so you

358
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,319
know cannabis was doing this thing and

359
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,559
then you know Along Comes um you know

360
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,560
Homo sapian sapiens and um you know we

361
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,679
we we've got some earliest evidence

362
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,439
abuses and I can't remember exact dates

363
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:52,599
here uh some 30,000 20,000 years is

364
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,440
something in that range is that righto

365
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,320
somewhere in that range you start seeing

366
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,639
polling of cannabis in uh Europe uh and

367
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,759
you start seeing um you know pottery

368
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,839
markings uh things like that of twine I

369
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,480
can't remember the exact years but there

370
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,440
are various distinct domestication

371
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,120
episodes that occur in Asia um which is

372
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,600
of course where it would naturally first

373
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,799
occur because that's where cannabis is

374
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,440
uh and the movement of cannabis across

375
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,039
uh from South Asia across to East Asia

376
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,920
into China we think was through hun

377
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:30,078
gatherers moving through this green belt

378
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:31,519
that came across all of Asia in China

379
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,278
and this is really interesting you know

380
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,039
to see how people are moving with this

381
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:40,600
um there were uses for seed uses for

382
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:44,240
fiber uh and then this the idea of using

383
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,319
heated cannabis greens for drug effects

384
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,318
uh is some is involved in primordial

385
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:52,120
relig is is the remnant of that we find

386
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:56,759
in primordial religious texts uh from

387
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,318
zor asrian um you know viic uh viic

388
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,720
societies um

389
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:03,958
those are mainly the existing written

390
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,160
texts that go further back but there's

391
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:09,039
current ongoing archaeologic studies of

392
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,958
a civilization called the haraa

393
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,278
civilization and there one thing called

394
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:17,119
the bactera complex which is in like a

395
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:19,559
place called tur it's now turkistan or

396
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,399
Turkmenistan this sort of region you can

397
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,919
find clay pots uh small cups and they

398
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,360
would have clay pots and they would have

399
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:31,240
little seves and inside those clay pots

400
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,000
you see remnants of E ra uh cannabis and

401
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,399
if I'm not mistaken opum uh those three

402
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,240
things in drinks that people drank and

403
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:44,120
revered uh and

404
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,639
uh you know uh same pot in the same pot

405
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,240
yeah it's it's a mix you know it's a

406
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:53,159
mixed wine mixed drink uh this

407
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,839
is fedra gives you stimulation opium you

408
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,639
know Somas and cannabis little

409
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,319
activation as well other kind other

410
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,919
sorts this ation was a possibly part of

411
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:06,599
the primordial Soma that has been sung

412
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:10,078
about for centuries or ha in other texts

413
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,838
in Persia so this was this was a drug

414
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,000
complex this was not around um you know

415
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,119
cannabis to starve for famine or

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,558
cannabis to make my shoes this was

417
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:24,198
Cannabis to bring me uh relief from

418
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:26,599
distress uh anxiety and closer to toity

419
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,600
spirituality Spiritual

420
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,199
Development uh so and in different parts

421
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,000
of Asia you saw different developments

422
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,000
of these types of cultures uh and

423
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,839
sometimes there were there was more drug

424
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,038
and more and less of the uh the thread

425
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,678
and utilization and sometimes it was the

426
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:46,839
other way around but this in these areas

427
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,000
indicaa was all about that European

428
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:51,480
cultures that developed around the stand

429
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
of cannabis that came from the northern

430
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,880
uh uh population uh you know cannabis

431
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,839
was more in the realm of uh cloth and

432
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,640
fiber this was described by Herodotus

433
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,399
Herodotus was the ancient Greek

434
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,919
historians the first references you see

435
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,519
uh the the very famous thing is the

436
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,000
whole cth I don't know if you guys know

437
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:14,000
whoever reads this stuff the cian

438
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,759
funeral writes of using hemp seeds

439
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,720
thrown on flames and people of guess

440
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,759
that maybe that was also psychoactive

441
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,120
but we don't really know for sure U but

442
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,558
the other thing that he mentions is that

443
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,239
cannabis fiber was used in thce which is

444
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:28,000
a you know that that itself tells you

445
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,359
that there was a development of a fiber

446
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,159
textile industry around H cannabis in

447
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,199
Ancient Ancient Greek at times uh and

448
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,799
then spread with the Romans and and

449
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,519
whatnot so cannabis was about that there

450
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:43,279
were some medical uses described for

451
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,720
hemp seeds and and texts of like for ear

452
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,440
infections I think that

453
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,240
right okay so the oil from ear from

454
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,960
seeds but uh you know they didn't know

455
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,798
much about anything

456
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,640
else so I guess uh a lot of fascinating

457
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:59,359
developments happened in South Asian

458
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,440
cultures around cannabis

459
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,439
but really we don't hear much about it

460
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,159
until the

461
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,000
1500s U because this again this is the

462
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:11,559
moment when Portuguese Sailors uh land

463
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,400
in in modern day South Asia and start

464
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:17,399
noticing people drinking this thing

465
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,919
called bang VA n they called it uh and

466
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,320
this was uh something that they

467
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,520
associated with underclasses people who

468
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:29,558
uh were doing Labor uh people who were

469
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,158
uh cooking cleaning um and then the

470
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,000
sailors started to use it too and they

471
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,320
said well this is this this this makes

472
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,640
me laugh this makes me hungry this is

473
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:40,119
this is interesting what is this stuff

474
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,000
um and you know there's there's actually

475
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:44,678
some nice quotes in here about the very

476
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,319
first sailor who came across this and he

477
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,960
he said it looks like the stuff we have

478
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,200
back home but it really

479
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,679
isn't I know where it is I'll I'll look

480
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,480
for it a little bit anyway uh this these

481
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,000
moments start to show Europeans that

482
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,759
there's this other uh type of cannabis

483
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,759
and um it starts to spread from there U

484
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,480
you start getting also more Europe

485
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,119
English Sailors start coming a guy named

486
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,319
uh I forgot his name right now he was he

487
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,678
was in in Sri Lanka and he had found

488
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,240
cannabis was being used indigenously and

489
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,080
he found that when he had terrible GI

490
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,120
upset you know from all the exposure to

491
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,678
different types of bacteria and water

492
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,599
that he's drinking there compared to

493
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,120
what he has in Europe uh that he could

494
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,399
drink used cannabis and he would still

495
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,759
get an appetite and you know not end up

496
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,559
was awayed that from diarrhea that can

497
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,759
would normally otherwise kill you so

498
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:35,119
that was interesting to him he brought

499
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,480
seed back

500
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,319
to the one and only Robert Hook does

501
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,360
anybody know who Robert Hook

502
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:48,359
is okay besid

503
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:51,678

504
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,639
that's right yes he he the father of the

505
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,679
modern

506
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,280
microscope uh he is the one of the one

507
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,480
of the founders of you know one of the

508
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:03,960
Great scientist in the history of

509
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,960
Western medicine Newton's uh

510
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,240
Newton's competitor right you know they

511
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,080
they were it was there was Newton and

512
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,960
there was hook you know and of course we

513
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:17,519
remember remember Newton but um Hook was

514
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,278
really a major player on the scene in

515
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,200
Europe in England in the Royal Society

516
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:25,038
the first President I believe Royal

517
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,759
Society which still exists to this day

518
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,599
um so he started growing cannabis from

519
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,558
the seed that this other guy brought

520
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,240
didn't do too well apparently but uh he

521
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:35,200
also tried using some of the canns that

522
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,400
he had and so he was one of he is the

523
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,519
first Western scientist to methodically

524
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,360
cultivate consume and describe the

525
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,839
effects of K and this guy is literally

526
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,959
one of the most famous books in the

527
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:51,359
history of microbiology he basically

528
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,558
tripped out a whole lot of Europeans uh

529
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,719
because he showed everyone but a

530
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,918
protozoa looked like or am it was like a

531
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,679
very bizarre new thing his book was very

532
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:02,159
popular

533
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,120
so uh this is how cannabis becomes a

534
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,919
thing in you know English-speaking world

535
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:08,359
anglophone world it was through these

536
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,679
exposures from Colonial Sailors to South

537
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:14,079
Asia also u a lot of cross-pollination

538
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,559
starts happening on the ships of portug

539
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,000
Portuguese sailed around the world uh

540
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,960
often times you'd have um Africans and

541
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,798
South Asians and different classes of

542
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,720
people trying to survive on these boats

543
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,639
and this is one thing way that people

544
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,159
exp were cross exposed to use of

545
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,720
cannabis and I already told you about

546
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,400
the afan story uh and it had spread

547
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,798
first in the eastern part of Africa and

548
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,360
then it took really I think it was

549
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,960
somewhere in the 1600s or so that you

550
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,158
got to the western part of Africa kind

551
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,480
of in the area of South Africa and

552
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,640
um South Africa and Namibia but really

553
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,679
didn't extend beyond Sudan for a long

554
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,038
time so this is that this is like what

555
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,480
people are starting to put together when

556
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,038
you try to put all the different

557
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,038
historical records together all the U

558
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:57,640
physical evidences you see these

559
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,079
distinct patterns of migration of

560
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,799
cannabis with really really interesting

561
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:05,519
is when it starts to get out to this

562
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,599
part of north of the earth um you know

563
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,200
it was really through uh the

564
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:14,480
transatlantic slave trade

565
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:18,720
indentured uh systems of of of colonial

566
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,599
labor practices um cannabis was always

567
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,558
associated with menial

568
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:28,000
work relief people who uh did menial

569
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:30,759
jobs and uh who had didn't have a lot of

570
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,558
uh self saying that cannabis was

571
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,679
something that was used to help to deal

572
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,599
with monotony and this is a very this

573
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,679
famously entered into the popular

574
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,798
American discourse in the 70s when um

575
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,240
well if anybody was reading uh the

576
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,400
medical Anthropologist went to Jamaica

577
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,960
and studied uh the use of cannabis in

578
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,798
Jamaica Melanie Dre and a few other

579
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,319
folks I can't remember all their names

580
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:58,440
um but this was a time when people were

581
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:00,558
saying oh Canabis makes you lazy and aot

582
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,200
moated uh there they would find workers

583
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,440
that say Hey without cannabis I can't

584
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,519
you know it makes me motivated to work

585
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,519
it was very confusing to people because

586
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,960
we've been taught so long that it led to

587
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,599
this state of apathy uh and here here

588
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,720
you have more extent cultures that came

589
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:20,199
from those you know Caribbean um

590
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,919
agrarian uh work where it was just the

591
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,640
opposite so that um that's a little bit

592
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,080
of how things kind of seeped in here and

593
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,080
you guys have heard more of the stories

594
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,480
about Mexican migration or whatnot the

595
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,798
other part of the story I want to share

596
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,880
with you is kind of the history of

597
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:36,359
medicine because a lot of these things

598
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,440
are are forgotten people don't really um

599
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,199
talk about how cannabis uh made its way

600
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,919
into the most revered pharmaceutical

601
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,200
houses and in the books of the most

602
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,720
established and prestigious phans in the

603
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,840
in the history of modern medicine uh

604
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,798
they just think oh you know this is

605
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,558
something that we heard about the 1960s

606
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:58,000
and 70s when you know people were uh

607
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:58,918
people had severe symptoms of cancer and

608
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,558
HIV

609
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,320
and and then of course glaucoma those

610
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:06,359
three are really how people think that

611
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,599
cannabis's medicine became a thing but

612
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,599
really and this is a lot of work has

613
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:14,359
shown multiple uses of cannabis and and

614
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,240
various systems of medicine uh

615
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:17,599
traditional Chinese medicine so

616
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,720
traditional stuff we know about

617
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,918
traditional Chinese medicine unani tibbi

618
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,000
uh forms of Persian medicine a very

619
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:31,000
famous doctor uh Ian Senna iban Senna

620
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
also called AI in the west same guy uh

621
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,880
when you look at the government of

622
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,759
India's traditional knowledge Digital

623
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,080
Library where they try to catalog all

624
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:40,720
their plants so that somebody doesn't

625
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,599
come in Monsanto their traditional you

626
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:48,240
know crops which has been tried multiple

627
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:50,359
multiple times uh such as uh neem and U

628
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,519
turmeric have been attempted to be

629
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:55,959
monopolized by

630
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:58,000
Western companies uh and I believe I've

631
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,319
heard that cannabis was also attempted

632
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,798
but what they started to do is uh create

633
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:04,678
a digital library they said you know

634
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,000
here's traditional prior use we got this

635
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,840
prior use prior use prior use so there

636
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,960
was an entry in there for canabus and

637
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,798
what they site for their traditional

638
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,679
here's our prior use is the textbook of

639
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:16,319
abna from the 11th century and it's a

640
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,440
really interesting reason they cite this

641
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,798
book is because this book of Arabic

642
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,600
medicine was what they used in medieval

643
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,359
Europe to teach medicine when there was

644
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,639
no medicine besides you know leeches and

645
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:28,359
blood lining or whatever they did you

646
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,600
know in medieval Middle Ages and I don't

647
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,519
to be completely split but that's what

648
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,798
it was this was the Greek uh the Greeks

649
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,918
got it from the uh the Arabs got it from

650
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,720
the Greeks and the Arabs maintained it

651
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,440
and and expanded it and then gave it

652
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,558
back to the Europeans and this is a

653
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,278
citation they use uh but uh there is a

654
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:47,158
small reference to cannabis in Europe

655
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:50,079
but you know again it wasn't as widely

656
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,039
known until the 1800s or uh the 19th

657
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:56,000
century when these modern Physicians

658
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:59,079
were coming to um Kolkata and uh that's

659
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,679
where Dr Ran see which we all know about

660
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,720
everyone know about asanas asanas is the

661
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,200
name taken by uh for the group of

662
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,120
California medical cannabis doctors

663
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,200
since 1996 Dr Mia's group he's he was

664
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,158
the grandfather of medical cannabis he

665
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,880
also extracted all his old literature

666
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:19,320
he's now passed away 2007 I think he

667
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,240
passed away from liver cancer um anyway

668
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,759
uh he he named his group oases because

669
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,000
he wanted to pay homage to this Irish

670
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,319
physician who was so brilliant that he

671
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,480
actually uh you know learned cannabis

672
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:34,319
from the natives in Kolkata and used it

673
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,960
on his patients to treat things like uh

674
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,798
rabies endstage rabies where you get to

675
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,399
a phase where the rabies goes into your

676
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,798
central nervous system and you can't

677
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,398
drink anything you can't eat anything

678
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:45,960
you're extremely like you just like

679
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,839
waste away and everything you try to put

680
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,038
in your mouth you spit out and he would

681
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,319
give cannabis grains to those patients

682
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,519
and they would be able to start eating

683
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,038
oranges and have more relaxation and

684
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,079
fall asleep and and pass away

685
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,119
comfortably he gave it to patients who

686
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:01,678
had tetanus really Advanced stages of

687
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,599
tetanus where you were just stiff and he

688
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,000
could kind of relax them uh some

689
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,158
infantile cases and he's he writes it

690
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,398
all up he gives it to animals and

691
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,960
medical students he says this is an

692
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,359
amazing thing you know I'm going to make

693
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,759
my my name for this he actually didn't

694
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,719
make his name on that he made his name

695
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,480
on something else he laid the telegraph

696
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,200
lines in India uh and was kned for that

697
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,919
so you know he had a previous amazing

698
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,278
thing where he figured out how to I

699
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,519
hydrate people Colora victims as a

700
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,079
medical student people were dying of

701
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,960
dehydration and he said why don't we put

702
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:33,038
electrolytes in the fluids and put that

703
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,880
in their veins and maybe they'll survive

704
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,158
and he wrote those ideas down and that's

705
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,320
of course current day

706
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,440
treatment that's that's what we do so

707
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:42,879
this guy was pretty cool and uh he was a

708
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,480
really um interesting fellow we don't

709
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
hear about him at

710
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,360
all I mean why is it not taught why is

711
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,600
he not taught in medical schools why

712
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,158
because it was a cannabis thing right

713
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,359
because so his introduction into the

714
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,440
modern medicine of cannabis really

715
00:28:54,359 --> 00:29:00,199
excited all sorts of people in Europe

716
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,640
and back in the UK and in Ohio all over

717
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,840
you know you'll see there was meetings

718
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,799
in 1850s or Ohio doctors just after he

719
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,119
published in 1840 something so people

720
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:09,879
were really interested in what was going

721
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,479
on in IND in India and they were this is

722
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,840
a great treatment for neurological

723
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,240
disorders and for pain um we were just

724
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:19,000
talking about migraines Dr beforehand U

725
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,319
the there was a doctor at the New York

726
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,640
neurological Society named segn he was a

727
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,798
president of the society he said it's

728
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,679
the most Superior treatment that he

729
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:27,158
knows for migraine headaches and Dr

730
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,798
Willie Mosler the father of internal

731
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,039
medicine who found a joh Hopkins

732
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,639
University and started rounding you know

733
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,079
you hear about white coat Dockers going

734
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,240
around hospitals rounding that's what uh

735
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,678
that's what doct Osler did came up with

736
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,159
and he he wrote about that in his

737
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,640
textbooks this is the treatment that you

738
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,799
got to use for Migra

739
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,759
hings U there was another doctor uh who

740
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:50,319
invented opalos scalpy I mean looking

741
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:51,679
into your you know when the doctor puts

742
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,720
up into your eye and looks into your

743
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,960
retina and sees if there's any illness

744
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,038
there what the blood vessels look like

745
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,319
the Doctor Who had routinely started

746
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,919
introducing that in medical practice uh

747
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,918
he was a big fan of use of cannabis uh

748
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,399
the one of the doctors who first started

749
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,038
to to distinguish the different types of

750
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:12,798
epilepsy more generalized versus related

751
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:15,319
to an injury he was a big fan of

752
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,480
cannabis uh the Doctor Who was one of

753
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:20,240
the early researchers of Parkinson's

754
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,278
disease I don't know if the poiner of

755
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,038
Parkinson's disease but some somebody

756
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,240
who did some major work uh he also

757
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:29,679
talked about canvas there was a lot of

758
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,880
really Advanced top Notch physicians in

759
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,759
the in the UK and in United States or in

760
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,080
Canada um who for can for them cannabis

761
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,440
was a very unique and important part of

762
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,119
the medical

763
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,038
pharmacopia uh there was even U Brown

764
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,398
there a there's a syndrome we call you

765
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,079
there's some things in medical school

766
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,278
you any medical students say hey what

767
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,439
what do you call a a patient who has a

768
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,398
spinal cord injury that's only halfway

769
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,159
done you know it's a one half of the

770
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,119
cord is cut the other half is okay

771
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,919
sometimes it happens in injuries motorcy

772
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:02,319
vehicle accidents it's called a brown

773
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,960
sequard syndrome Brown seard syndrome

774
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,798
where one side of the body has one

775
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,919
deformity the other side has another Dr

776
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:10,519
Brown secard had his own cannabis

777
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,880
preparation named for him cannabis and a

778
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,480
few other things in that so I tried to

779
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,320
tell this to the students and doctors I

780
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,720
talk to to let them know this is

781
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,638
actually the names Osler and all these

782
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,880
names are in our current textbooks and

783
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:24,599
teachings these all these doctors saw

784
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,200
cannabis as something that was important

785
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:29,158
part of their pharmacopia we

786
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,919
unfortunately lost it due to

787
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,559
inability to understand what it was the

788
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,960
rising prominence of pharmaceutical

789
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,879
houses the consolidation of Power by

790
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,600
professionals uh and Etc and the closure

791
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,639
of certain alternative medical practices

792
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,119
in the United States all these things

793
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:44,678
there was a bunch of forces not to

794
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,239
mention good old fashion racism and

795
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,320
xenophobia and all the things that we

796
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,079
are still dealing with in 2017 those

797
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,558
were probably worse back then anyway so

798
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:57,119
but it's not the science it's not

799
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,079
through the this is not cannabis

800
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,798
medicine was not a recent discovery

801
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:04,678
that's kind of it was never alien it was

802
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:07,119
never alien it was always tracking along

803
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,679
different groups in society that may not

804
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:13,038
may or may not have maintained a level

805
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,000
of Civility or

806
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,879
respectability but we're changing all

807
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,839
that now right we're we we've kind of uh

808
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,240
we've kind of gotten into a very new

809
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,439
place with cannabis and I think my

810
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,960
message I probably need to wind down or

811
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,720
take some questions or something but I

812
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,720
guess where I can a 15 minutes to keep

813
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,720
talking

814
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,839
yeah

815
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,079
H okay okay I will what what I want to

816
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:44,439
tell you about this whole where I see

817
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:46,398
that so I let me give a little bit of a

818
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,558
a moral or I don't

819
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:53,079
know an idea to think about so if

820
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:55,599
cannabis uh has so many fingers uh pre

821
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:58,319
of course prior to human evolution uh

822
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,599
and Beyond uh so many fingers so many

823
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:04,879
different civilizations throughout the

824
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:06,480
eons um and U you know who who actually

825
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,320
gets to say at the end of the day that

826
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,960
they're they get the rightful prominence

827
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,359
over that

828
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,759
species I don't think I don't think

829
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,599
anybody could really claim that if

830
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,240
anybody if one person claims it

831
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:20,599
everybody has to claim it right you

832
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,759
really can't choose it was never any

833
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:26,480
prior you know uh owner and that's a

834
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:28,359
that's for me a very uh important lesson

835
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,639
to draw from that when we talk

836
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,240
social policy and we're talking about

837
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:35,240
who has access to the means of

838
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,079
production you know to use an old term

839
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:42,480
from marks uh but it's a it's it's the

840
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:47,199
this human plant relationship is not a

841
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,038
imaginary or trivial or kind of a hippie

842
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,840
New Age concept or whatever this is a

843
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,038
fundamental to how we have actually

844
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:58,398
interacted with our our planet and the

845
00:33:55,038 --> 00:34:00,879
things in it and that we ignore at our

846
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:04,000
Peril and I think the fact that we don't

847
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,320
even talk about it uh is because we have

848
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,199
become so commodified in our society

849
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:11,918
that we are so dis removed from uh I

850
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,158
mean there are variations on that that's

851
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,759
that things have changed but I think we

852
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,240
think always think about cannabis in not

853
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,800
already sort of process ready to go away

854
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,199
and the fact that we don't pay attention

855
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,519
to that um ground level up side of

856
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,878
things is why I think we never developed

857
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,759
a legalization of production you know

858
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:32,838
for all adults in this state uh I mean

859
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,200
there's other Histories on that but you

860
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,639
know it would have been Unthinkable if

861
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,559
you had imagine cannabis legalization in

862
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,240
other times in

863
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:45,000
history that that that didn't

864
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,118
fundamentally mean you know being able

865
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to

866
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,039
cultivate and doing all that in your

867
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,679
whatever is your space or your community

868
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:58,279
space so that is a interesting kind of

869
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,559
thing to come out of this this uh moral

870
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,760
from this and I I think this issue of

871
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,599
monopolization or or I also like the

872
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,079
term

873
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,359
alization you guys know the these long

874
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,599
words but these are really ways to talk

875
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:17,159
about few people own or one person own

876
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,240
mono or Alo and I think that is the

877
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,759
whole way that cannabis diffused in

878
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:24,199
around the world was because multiple

879
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,839
people owned not just one or two or

880
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:29,239
three but like the most marginal person

881
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:32,199
in society stuck on a slave ship you

882
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:33,919
know uh going someplace they know not

883
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:36,078
and they bring with them a few seeds

884
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,200
from what their Homeland is to produced

885
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,359
there whether they're indentured or or

886
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:42,639
uh getting no pay at all uh these are

887
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:44,480
the kind of people that own cannabis and

888
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,279
that's why we have cannabis here you

889
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,639
know it was not because we were you know

890
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,880
uh had a billion dollars of extra money

891
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,118
sitting around and you know or had where

892
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,640
the son of the king or whatever it would

893
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,358
have been back then would be the

894
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,279
equivalent of privileg today and I think

895
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,078
that's really an interesting thing to

896
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,760
think about when you when you wonder

897
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,680
well who is going to own cannabis in

898
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,800
North America or in in the global

899
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:12,118
society

900
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,119
today uh okay I'll stop

901
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,838
there all right

902
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:32,680
who so I'm really interested in can

903
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:34,078
as uh Apes sexual aid for women after

904
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:36,279
menopause when they kind of lose

905
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,519
interest in sex I've been trying to

906
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,640
research that however I can and and of

907
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:45,480
course the Indian tant kind of trys they

908
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:49,239
talk about the Fang for what he should

909
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,880
be using which is a drink as you said so

910
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,679
what do you think that that's the drink

911
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,519
are they not smoking it then you

912
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:58,078
mentioned again sailor seeing

913
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,519
that so two two things first all modern

914
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:06,599
use on cannabis sexuality a really great

915
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:08,800
talk is by Dr Jordan tishler TI i h c he

916
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,559
gave a talk at green flower media

917
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,280
cannabis help Summit last year he was

918
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:17,400
there with me about a year ago I think

919
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,079
2016 uh in January it's probably online

920
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,358
someplace uh it was very good he really

921
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,440
summarized a lot of modern sex uh human

922
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,279
sexuality research around cannabis even

923
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,000
there's even some controlled research on

924
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,960
on cannabis and blood flow to organs and

925
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,559
and um there's like psychological stuff

926
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,079
and there's physiological stuff there's

927
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:38,039
a whole there's a whole world of that

928
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:39,760
that I I know very little about his talk

929
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,318
really put a lot of it together so

930
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,440
please look for that he's really into

931
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:47,639
that and um and I think that's a huge um

932
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,200
untapped area when we talk about you

933
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,559
know this whole this whole very modern

934
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:55,199
distinction we have between what's

935
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,759
recreational you know and what's really

936
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,159
medical and and then what's health that

937
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,839
you know I think that's both right you

938
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,920
can't have you're not going to be

939
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:04,960
healthy if you have no Recreation and if

940
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,760
you don't have access to Medicine you

941
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,199
also will be Healy either so it's kind

942
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,480
of need them both anyway so that's a

943
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:15,759
thing to to say and then I the Tantra

944
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,318
cannabis use of there's a a really good

945
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,960
paper from 1970s by a Dr Michael alich

946
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:23,599
count of cannabis using India Journal of

947
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,480
psychoactive drugs I think it was he was

948
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,280
the first one to really I thought pulled

949
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,838
some of these texts together a lot of

950
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,960
what was happening there was various

951
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:36,480
forms of violation of social Moray so

952
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,639
people who did not eat meat that night

953
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,280
they would eat some beef people who did

954
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,000
not use alcohol they would drink some

955
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,960
hard alcohol they would use you know

956
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,400
cannabis was also a little bit of a

957
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,519
always seen though it was not illegal

958
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,760
there was some groups in certain times

959
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,400
you would use it you know and if you

960
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,920
were't using it in off time is was like

961
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,519
hey you're kind of doing something that

962
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,400
you're not supposed to so some of that

963
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:02,358
was that to um um but yes that all the

964
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,079
use of cannabis in those uh uh social

965
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:07,880
religious contexts were was oral um

966
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,240
there is inhaled cannabis use as well in

967
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,280
groups there but that's not what's

968
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:13,919
described in Dr alder's book or paper

969
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,359
and I think that what's happening you

970
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,480
know is that you just get a longer

971
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,318
duration effect uh and there is a

972
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,920
there's a first path through the liver

973
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:25,239
you get this stronger 11 hydroxy

974
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,880
metabolite of THC as opposed to when you

975
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,959
get inhaled you get a much much lower

976
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,680
amount of that

977
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,559
that has more blood brain barrier

978
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,480
penetrability uh you have a longer

979
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:38,358
lasting effect uh and it's stronger and

980
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,519
you know you can go all night long I'm

981
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,519
just

982
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:48,329
joking that's why do like that why would

983
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,960
you know we're not take your

984
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:53,519
[Music]

985
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:58,159
time all right who was the

986
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:59,920
top I have a leading question for you s

987
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:03,199
uh you've talked a lot about you know

988
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,079
humans and the history of cannabis I

989
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,199
want to hear a little bit for the room

990
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,720
uh about the history of women and

991
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,118
cannabis

992
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:13,358
uh uh because obviously there's a

993
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,000
gendered history there uh and I know

994
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:20,078
that you could speak about but yeah and

995
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,519
there's a great U uh she's at University

996
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,160
of Southern Maine she wrote that book on

997
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:27,639
you know the Wham Community

998
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,759
wom BL know her name just right now now

999
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:33,400
Wendy chapus thank you yeah Dr Wendy

1000
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,839
chapus was a sociologist who studies had

1001
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,960
studied sex workers in in the US and and

1002
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,759
started writing about cannabis scene and

1003
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,358
a really great book you can check it out

1004
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,640
called D to get high and uh she has a

1005
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:50,519
really great chapter on the F the the

1006
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,519
gendered issues around cannabis uh that

1007
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,599
some of the Notions throughout cannabis

1008
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,679
as a uh you know the female flowers and

1009
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,200
some of the emotional receptivity things

1010
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:03,199
that it does generate in its users uh

1011
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:06,000
these are part of why it's being

1012
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:11,000
maligned and she kind of ties it into

1013
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,318
sexual um you know the feminist feminist

1014
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,440
lens

1015
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:17,199
um and there was another another uh

1016
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,960
person who's written something out else

1017
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,399
recently there's tremendous uh

1018
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,318
masculinity in the U modern High Times

1019
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,599
portrayals that historically started

1020
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,279
High Times and Playboy join started

1021
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:30,838
together you know were funded by the

1022
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,280
same people they catered to the same

1023
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:36,960
crowd you know and it was uh it was out

1024
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:40,800
of that kind of a fishing a you know um

1025
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,679
smoking your cigar in your you know what

1026
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,119
that rope that you know the these

1027
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:49,039
Notions were were popularized as if it

1028
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,079
is a strictly masculine you know thing

1029
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,800
High time but that's completely like

1030
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,760
modern you know was thinking 19th

1031
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,280
century yeah so if you go further back

1032
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:05,400
you know uh I mean the historically in

1033
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:08,640
uh in Europe uh the witch hunts which

1034
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,639
were I don't know 100, women were burned

1035
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:15,400
the stake or bu through through a effort

1036
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:18,039
through the Royals and Catholic Church

1037
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,760
they really eradicated traditional plant

1038
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:23,119
healers um a lot of these were women and

1039
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,040
a lot of them you think had cannabis

1040
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,119
knowledge in in addition to other herbs

1041
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:32,400
uh and uh I think that

1042
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,599
uh is part of uh you know what we've

1043
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,800
lost uh um the use of canvas and child

1044
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,079
birth is also something that we know

1045
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,240
have evidence from in the Levant like

1046
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,240
modern Israel Palestine in actual

1047
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:47,558
physical evidence of people who are

1048
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:49,000
giving birth uh we've seen in their

1049
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:52,000
bones and their remains have died in

1050
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,838
child birth cannabis residue and I think

1051
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,079
that uh use in ways to help Labor uh you

1052
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:01,119
know these things have been completely

1053
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:02,880
marginalized as if that doesn't matter

1054
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,720
and then not to mention you you talked

1055
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,079
about menopause and there's also men uh

1056
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:12,000
you know menstrual dysphoria related

1057
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:13,519
pain uh this this has a lot of patients

1058
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,358
have said that cannabis is helpful for

1059
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:19,358
them to have more uh when they have

1060
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:20,759
severe uh symptoms also in in pregnancy

1061
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,759
there's the nause and vomiting of

1062
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,000
pregnancy severe problems we get

1063
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,079
hospitalized but we have no good

1064
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,159
treatments for that and we give very

1065
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,400
drugs that may be more harmful to the uh

1066
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:34,440
to their conceptus than than what they

1067
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,519
are taking and that's terrible uh when

1068
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,039
cannabis we don't have strong evidence

1069
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:39,880
that it's this very dangerous thing but

1070
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:41,880
we know that it can help people in that

1071
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,760
scenario and we don't even have that

1072
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,200
option available so there's lots of

1073
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,599
things that we don't think about that

1074
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:50,000
are specific to women's bodies around

1075
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,480
and their traditional knowledge that

1076
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,800
have been completely ignored as if

1077
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,358
that's sort of like a marginal issue I'm

1078
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,480
sure there's way more histories there I

1079
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:01,838
don't I mean they don't what I was

1080
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,159
leading to oh tell no no no you did it

1081
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:04,159
you did

1082
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:13,000
it this is a much more boring

1083
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,160
question I I can't even come close to

1084
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,880
that that was good both of those were

1085
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,920
talking about two distinct species Inda

1086
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,400
and then you kind of touched on ralis a

1087
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:29,039
little bit is there I mean is there any

1088
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,039
historic Route of know

1089
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:35,440
yeah based on Hill's work the genetic

1090
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,040
analysis of various libraries they

1091
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,838
didn't find a third grouping it's just

1092
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:43,519
those is actually it's a weedy version

1093
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:45,880
of one of the two or a mix of the both

1094
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,679
this is cannabis is a semi-domesticated

1095
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:52,200
plant it never stays domesticated why

1096
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:53,639
it's a weed right right so so some of

1097
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:56,199
these stands may have been around for

1098
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:57,759
Millennia uh there are still while in

1099
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:59,118
that area where can evolved I was

1100
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,920
telling you about you can still find

1101
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,440
wild grown cannabis in the forests and

1102
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,880
the rivers uh and so I think uh it's

1103
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,079
came to the attention of Western

1104
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,440
scientists uh by Soviet botanists in

1105
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,160
sometime in the 30s or 40s I don't know

1106
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,559
I can't remember when this is who coined

1107
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:20,358
the term R RIS Soviet

1108
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,720
biologist but I think people just didn't

1109
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:23,159
really know they had no idea for

1110
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,679
nomenclatures again they were just like

1111
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:26,759
physical traits that they thought set

1112
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:28,199
set it apart I'm not saying that there

1113
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,720
might not be there's definitely a

1114
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:32,039
geography to genetic distribution but if

1115
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,399
you really want to get into the

1116
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:36,358
speciation um we don't we don't find

1117
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,079
that that's not eventually we're going

1118
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:40,000
to change our the classification has

1119
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,240
been contested for so long even the fact

1120
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,519
that we used and named it cannabis and

1121
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,639
that we uh had sativa for you know

1122
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:49,039
something everything to do with where

1123
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:50,639
lenus the botanist in Sweden where he

1124
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,519
was at the time and what he knew about

1125
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:56,159
cannabis he had no knowledge of drug

1126
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:59,079
cannibis it was all the other stuff I

1127
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:01,719
know so H fit in with it well yeah hemp

1128
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:04,839
is the the uses what we now call hemp

1129
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:09,159
the uses of cannabis that involve fiber

1130
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:11,519
and uh cellulose uh cordage and Seed um

1131
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:14,239
you can produce that from either of

1132
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,318
those two classes of cannabis uh that's

1133
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:19,318
for sure uh just some of them what

1134
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:22,679
happened in India uh they started to

1135
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:25,400
make charas and ganja which are like

1136
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,519
more uh something that's with charas you

1137
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,599
would actually want you you run your

1138
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,480
body through the field and then scrape

1139
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,480
the resin off your

1140
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:45,480
bodys learn it from gos people step on

1141
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,519
grapes and wineries all the time how

1142
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,079
many people have oh it's so romantic to

1143
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,960
step on the grapes that then we consume

1144
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,559
in our wine so it's the

1145
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,079
same except you're just you know they

1146
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,839
would

1147
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,839
laughing so people are laughing

1148
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,280
Delight that's

1149
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:10,838
soard it the sex

1150
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,839
topic actually use they would often use

1151
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,240
children this is

1152
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:19,039
documented because so in order to do

1153
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:22,759
this they needed shorter plants in order

1154
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:25,000
to do a CH production you would you

1155
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,400
would select for varieties that wouldn't

1156
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,920
grow very tall so you could do that uh

1157
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,599
when you were making other materials uh

1158
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,400
Hong it was you didn't need to do that

1159
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,838
Char so you could grow taller so this is

1160
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,119
one way that some distinctions that we

1161
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:42,239
kind of think about Broad Leaf and

1162
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:45,519
narrow leaf and and size may have come

1163
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:47,799
out of this this genetic germ plasm pool

1164
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:51,199
that was down there um and then when

1165
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,760
chus production moved into uh Lebanon

1166
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,000
and the Middle East um people they may

1167
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,319
not have used shorter plants they may

1168
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,880
have used longer plants because they had

1169
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:01,880
different method methods of uh making

1170
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,440
hashish uh through you know sees and and

1171
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,920
the more powder things that we're more

1172
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,880
familiar with so all of these um so I

1173
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,159
think you know it's all to do with um

1174
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,640
just different versions of the same in

1175
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,679
the same family which which uh species

1176
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:20,199
of varials are more developed in the

1177
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,558
area of hemping that you want whether

1178
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:23,838
it's the stock or the fiber or stock or

1179
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,040
the seed

1180
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,599
predominantly you know and I I can tell

1181
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:32,719
you the restriction that we place on

1182
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:37,079
hemp today um probably like artificially

1183
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:40,919
limit the variety of thick stocked High

1184
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:43,440
yielding fiber oil seed uh cellulose

1185
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,318
plants that could be potentially grown

1186
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,599
uh so you're really not you really can't

1187
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:48,800
this whole idea that okay we're only

1188
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:52,680
going to have you know point less than

1189
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,318
3% for this means that a whole potential

1190
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:57,440
genetic you're chopping off the arm of

1191
00:48:55,318 --> 00:49:01,000
cannabis because maybe those those

1192
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,480
varieties have gen genes and features

1193
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,039
that'll be more helpful to uh have a

1194
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,079
greater yield if you're trying to get

1195
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,558
cellulose so that shouldn't be at all a

1196
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:15,559
barrier for at least R&amp;D uh when it

1197
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:17,760
comes to developing U good hearty hemp

1198
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:20,280
string I I think you more or less

1199
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,280
answered I was trying to sort of get to

1200
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:27,119
the um genetic origins of the drug type

1201
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:30,920
non-drug type uh narrowly broadly but it

1202
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:33,200
sounds like the drug type was being

1203
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,680
forced upwards over time and so had to

1204
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,879
respond through developing new canabo

1205
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:40,399
and terpenoids to protect itself whereas

1206
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,400
the non-drug type was more having to

1207
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,720
compete in the I'm sorry yeah the

1208
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,599
non-drug type was having to compete in

1209
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:48,480
the lowlands and you know in sort of

1210
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,519
more in a weedy environment um but then

1211
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,760
the broad leaf narrow Leaf sounds like

1212
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:56,920
was something that was more cultivated

1213
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,359
by humans along the way and so do we

1214
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,440
have really kind of can you break them

1215
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:03,880
into almost four distinct groups of kind

1216
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,079
of Bas cannabinoids and terpenoids and

1217
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,880
and and other is that one way to kind of

1218
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,318
look at it is you've got if you were to

1219
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,400
look at sort of the whole plan extract

1220
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:14,159
of non drug type drug type broadly Nar

1221
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,599
life would you have four distinct kind

1222
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:20,960
of groupings might you have I don't know

1223
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,798
I'll Leto answer that question it's on

1224
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,039
my knowledge uh I'll just say briefly

1225
00:50:23,798 --> 00:50:29,318
there's certain terpenoids that are

1226
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:34,279
associated with so-called sativa others

1227
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:36,519
with so-called Indica um to me this is

1228
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,160
sort of a false dichotomy I think people

1229
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:42,358
are really hung up on these names what

1230
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:45,719
you need to know is what the biochemical

1231
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:47,519
composition of whatever the the Cannabis

1232
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:50,439
is then you'll have an idea what it's

1233
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:54,159
good for um so whether you call it one

1234
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:58,679
species or four species to me is beside

1235
00:50:54,159 --> 00:51:02,159
the point at this time anyway my opinion

1236
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:02,159
I've been on every side of this

1237
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:09,318
issue yeah totally great discussion

1238
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,400
right but um so understood about the

1239
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:13,480
canono the different species but what

1240
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,160
are your thoughts about origin of photo

1241
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,440
period specific so photo photo period

1242
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,000
specific so you have like your auto

1243
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,119
flowers and then you have you know your

1244
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,119
your

1245
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,119
traditional

1246
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,558
cannabis species flowering you're

1247
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:32,239
talking about the daylight flowering

1248
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:33,960
patterns um so I just you know recently

1249
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,519
had my first experience with growing

1250
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,798
some autof flowers and um it was there

1251
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:43,318
was kind of an aha moment I thought well

1252
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:46,798
perhaps th this expression of cannabis

1253
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:48,960
was more in um areas where they had to

1254
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:51,119
capture a certain growing you know

1255
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,838
season and had to you know happen fast

1256
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,519
so I thought well maybe this this

1257
00:51:52,838 --> 00:51:57,078
genetic you know expressed in the

1258
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:59,239
Northern or or deep southern

1259
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:01,960
hemispheres you know it was just a total

1260
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:03,838
random thought right um as you know as

1261
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,920
opposed where you know our traditional

1262
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:10,119
cannabis could be um you know generating

1263
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,440
from you know more of the Tropic region

1264
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:16,280
where you would have you know the

1265
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,318
seasonality would go on I just it's just

1266
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,599
that's what I think the your your

1267
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:22,440
thought is what I think the thought that

1268
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:25,318
people have at least in this in this

1269
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,440
text uh he talks about the day night uh

1270
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:29,519
or at least the flowering pattern based

1271
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,240
on stresses of number of days of

1272
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,440
darkness and days of lightness has

1273
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:36,479
something to do with the latitude in

1274
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,519
which cannabis is being evolved so it

1275
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,440
has everything to do with that it just I

1276
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:42,318
think that makes the most sense we we

1277
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,480
have different uh probably there's other

1278
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:45,519
plants that are more have different

1279
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,559
behaviors that are come from the

1280
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,880
northern latitudes where there's much

1281
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:52,920
darker periods in Winter that are still

1282
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:55,880
living cannabis is is one I think the

1283
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,000
most domesticated plant on planet Earth

1284
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,480
it does there no other plant that grows

1285
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,519
in so many different places so this is

1286
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,599
this is extremely adaptable so it's got

1287
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:07,119
to be a wizard adapt to different CL

1288
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,160
different daylight Cycles I mean the

1289
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,880
plant still has to do photosynthesis has

1290
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:13,078
to have dark reactions it has to do all

1291
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,838
that stuff to to to make it to make it

1292
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:18,280
survive so that's I think you're on to

1293
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:19,639
something but I I have little more to

1294
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,400
offer than that but you I think you're

1295
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:24,838
on the right

1296
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:30,400
track um you talked about the the

1297
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:33,358
breeding for he and for um recreational

1298
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,358
and medicinal marijuana when did people

1299
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:39,279
start talking about the different

1300
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,279
effects of different strains of

1301
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,079
marijana is that a 20th century thing

1302
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,760
and I'm trying to think that's a good

1303
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:51,318
question never I never um I I know that

1304
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:55,680
U you know the canab stuff was being

1305
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:57,159
sold in uh pharmacies in the 20s and

1306
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,039
teens

1307
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:02,279
some of it was herbal some of it was

1308
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:03,679
tinctures uh they had variety of

1309
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,839
different effects people would talk

1310
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:08,960
about comparisons between this this

1311
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:10,679
stuff made by grimal was different from

1312
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,639
this stuff made by Park

1313
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:15,639
Davis but I don't think people

1314
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:17,960
understood much about we had no

1315
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:21,639
biochemical genetic variation

1316
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:23,559
understanding at least popular science

1317
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:25,279
literature people actually use this

1318
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:27,480
thing called a beam test to distinguish

1319
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,400
cannabis varieties and it was a bogus

1320
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,679
test but that's this is like it was they

1321
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,480
thought this was testing for canab andol

1322
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:36,358
it's it's a big so nobody really knew

1323
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,639
chemically okay so but what you're

1324
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:39,639
talking about is uh would be probably

1325
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:41,639
something that wouldn't have been

1326
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:44,759
written down maybe in the more folk

1327
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:45,759
Traditions so uh I I would wonder I

1328
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,280
would look more into that

1329
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,520
anthropological literature if there

1330
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,680
anything this is all like a lot of that

1331
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,480
stuff a lot of the stuff that was sold

1332
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:55,480
in the shops you know the exposure of

1333
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,920
the United of Americans to growing

1334
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,639
cannabis was very modern you know if you

1335
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,318
talk about here that's going to be in

1336
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:04,759
the you know post operation whatever

1337
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,639
that Mexican operation that Nixon ran

1338
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:09,000
his version of modern Trump wall thing

1339
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:10,798
going on here they did the same thing

1340
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,639
and this is what led to domestic

1341
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,838
cultivation and uh in the US in a wide

1342
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:18,639
huge explosion so maybe that's when when

1343
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:20,960
people started picking that up here but

1344
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:24,038
whether in there was knowledge of it and

1345
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,039
I I mean I know that um you know the

1346
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:29,200
idea of senia people think is a modern

1347
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,599
thing actually separate this was again

1348
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:34,038
South Asian cannabis farmers were

1349
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,798
separating males from females hundreds

1350
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:39,799
of years ago to produce gancha so that

1351
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:41,599
is a you know they probably had a lot of

1352
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:44,440
awareness of these different varieties

1353
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:48,559
but I don't haven't read much about

1354
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:51,200
it okay I take your point

1355
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,760
that proliferation of Campus has been a

1356
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:56,558
populist issue essentially I think

1357
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,440
that's particularly important for us now

1358
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,920
as we're being essentially sold a bill

1359
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,599
of goods of legalization yet it seems

1360
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,639
like to me and some others that

1361
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:08,680
prohibition version

1362
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:11,639
2.0 um are there other nuggets from

1363
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:15,000
history that you might be aware of that

1364
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:19,358
we can take fate from and leverage for a

1365
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,838
better effect than an extremely reactive

1366
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:24,400
prohibition this this book is crazy let

1367
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,838
me tell you uh the relationship of

1368
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,000
cannabis to various forms of ISM

1369
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:31,279
throughout history is something worth

1370
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,798
seriously noting uh it's really

1371
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,680
interesting uh look the so let's talk

1372
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:39,318
like you know let's say prohibition is

1373
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:42,318
really just social control model or

1374
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:44,639
whatever uh cannabis production was all

1375
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:47,318
was all the rage for running Mercantile

1376
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,759
systems to have your ships your cordage

1377
00:56:47,318 --> 00:56:52,719
and you it was backbreaking it's hard

1378
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,559
work to turn stand of cannabis you know

1379
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:57,078
not premodern societies so you really

1380
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:58,240
had to incen

1381
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:02,400
and you had to have people who were

1382
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,399
willing to work for cheap and work

1383
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:11,558
hard you

1384
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,200
say yeah for sure I mean but you know

1385
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,599
this was talking about in history but

1386
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:16,798
yeah these these things certainly we

1387
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,440
need to learn our history so we don't

1388
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:19,838
repeat them but there's a lot of

1389
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,519
interesting things this guy talks about

1390
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:25,480
some of the ways in which certain forms

1391
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:28,159
of transformation from slave systems to

1392
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,760
indentured Serv ude and how cannabis

1393
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:32,279
both use and and forcing people to grow

1394
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,440
it so there was a time where we had to

1395
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,519
force people to grow it not for you know

1396
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:40,119
for for hemp and then the dismantling of

1397
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:43,199
the American hemp industry after the

1398
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:46,720
Civil War because Kentucky could no

1399
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:49,358
longer sell to certain slave sell its

1400
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,199
raw materials to places where slave

1401
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,960
labor would take over the rest of the

1402
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:55,759
development process these are it's

1403
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,880
really interesting so the idea that you

1404
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,400
know

1405
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,838
you know you taking money off the backs

1406
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:05,358
of of disempowered people and cannabis

1407
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:07,798
that goes way back in various forms and

1408
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:09,358
I think we can learn a lot from

1409
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:12,599
understanding how that was actually done

1410
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:15,159
by these different Imperial Powers

1411
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:18,480
it's what you

1412
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:20,239
say nothing's changed yeah it's too bad

1413
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,960
but I think we know a lot more you know

1414
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:24,159
knowledge I do believe that education

1415
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,679
knowledge will you know and and and I

1416
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:29,480
think you know you can't can't uh it's

1417
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,318
not we can't call it alien anymore I

1418
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,119
mean we can't in good conscience now

1419
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:34,318
there's other then there's different

1420
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,280
various ways that we're trying to

1421
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:41,759
alienate cannabis now U you can look at

1422
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,839
the I mean I I mean the government is so

1423
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,119
recently the National Academy of

1424
00:58:42,838 --> 00:58:47,759
Medicine put out this report Big study

1425
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,440
January said okay I can conclusively say

1426
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,839
the leading scientific group in America

1427
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:55,798
cannabis has effects in chronic pain it

1428
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,519
relieves chronic pain no big surprise

1429
00:58:55,798 --> 00:59:01,159
this room room but you know the most

1430
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:03,199
AUST scientific bodies said it but just

1431
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:05,399
this morning the director of the

1432
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:07,838
National Institute on drug abuse like

1433
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,599
took issue with that so we're back to

1434
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:12,838
the same you know these kind of

1435
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:15,519
ridiculous back and forth you know and I

1436
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:17,639
just think that what I I my view is that

1437
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,280
cannabis is a traditional plant and

1438
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:22,038
traditional plants have protections

1439
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,519
under all forms of international law now

1440
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:26,280
international law has also got its

1441
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,119
problems with a un and who runs who who

1442
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,760
gets to call the shots over there but a

1443
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:31,400
lot of smaller countries work hard to

1444
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,079
get those traditional plant Protections

1445
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,559
in there and that is something that we

1446
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,720
need to uh keep saying over and over

1447
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,880
this is not an investigational new drug

1448
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,439
a modern a modern thing this is a

1449
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,720
traditional thing and if that has any

1450
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,760
value or any weight um if you go to sty

1451
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,879
Falls if there's a plaque there uh says

1452
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,440
traditional cultural property of the I

1453
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,480
forgot which tribe uh is had that so Bal

1454
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,639
tribe yeah so it's the traditional

1455
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,440
culture property a law under the

1456
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:02,519
American federal system this is one of

1457
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,400
the first places that got the

1458
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:06,199
recognition cannabis is traditional

1459
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,838
cultural property I think that's a very

1460
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:14,279
fair way to talk about it so follow up

1461
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:15,838
on that yeah sure give you a littleit um

1462
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:20,160
currently in Washington the only black

1463
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:22,078
letter law we have is uh thir County the

1464
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,598
curs correct been to the Supreme Court

1465
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,880
been vetted that's the best law we have

1466
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:31,720
and that's based in good samaritanism

1467
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:34,039
right so given that what does it say I

1468
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:36,558
not familiar with that ruling basically

1469
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:39,240
bill was growing to supply both for

1470
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,039
himself and for other folks and I think

1471
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:45,798
it involves both a commercial exchange

1472
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:48,319
for expenses as well as the fact that in

1473
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:50,440
a world in which there's no appropriate

1474
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:52,279
product you can be a Good Samaritan and

1475
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,280
provide at least this is what my lawyer

1476
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,440
tells me and I rely on every day right

1477
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,440
um

1478
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:03,880
so it it sounds like there's maybe even

1479
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:06,200
an older case in law to be made U my

1480
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,920
question boiling down to do you think

1481
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:12,879
we're in perhaps a more protected status

1482
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:16,960
here in Washington state as many of our

1483
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:20,559
States move on to more prohibitive and

1484
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:23,240
narrow uh scope of access do you think

1485
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,559
maybe we enjoy some special I'm looking

1486
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:28,239
for a silver lineon compared to other

1487
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,160
states I mean we we are special because

1488
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:31,598
we are Washington tonians and we have

1489
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,759
like a governor that's like you know

1490
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,960
going to stand up to the the presidents

1491
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,839
and sessions with you know cannabis push

1492
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,039
back that's that's unique you don't hear

1493
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:42,719
all the governors and all the legal

1494
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:48,480
states doing that uh we have also you

1495
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:48,480
know um we have a bash on

1496
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,720
island I mean there's that's there's

1497
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:57,078
something to be said for these for what

1498
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:58,679
we what you create I me I'm no attorney

1499
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:01,519
I don't know what what things can be

1500
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:03,078
argued I I thought law would be a great

1501
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:04,358
thing to go into when I was younger you

1502
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:06,960
know to fight for the rights of people

1503
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:09,598
but you have to really know what they'll

1504
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,920
listen to you know and all that but I I

1505
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,440
believe that um you know I did write

1506
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,039
something up with Katherine Pettis who's

1507
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,720
International Association of hospice and

1508
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:22,240
pal of care activist at the

1509
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:25,318
international level uh on this idea of U

1510
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:27,038
the the uh International drug treaties

1511
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:29,079
if you're going International similar

1512
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:31,839
kind of thing if you FR it down are a

1513
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:34,519
form of patent protections you know that

1514
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:36,719
gave ownership of these plants to uh

1515
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:38,639
governments and uh the government's

1516
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:41,558
friendly pharmaceutical companies and

1517
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:43,078
that's wrong and that's if you recognize

1518
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:45,480
that this plant is older than the

1519
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:47,318
company's ever existences then that that

1520
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,920
can't stand where you going to argue

1521
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:50,358
that probably in P or something but

1522
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:53,000
maybe you know our courts would

1523
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:54,519
recognize more of those things in other

1524
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,400
courts I don't know I mean there are

1525
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:58,480
always you should should talk to a

1526
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,440
lawyer but I I would love to there's a a

1527
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,960
lot of folks also interested in

1528
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,519
indigenous uh indigenous rights in this

1529
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,480
country this in this state we've got

1530
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:08,278
very active native uh tribe presence uh

1531
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,119
and they like to they follow whichever

1532
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:12,838
federal law or their treaty law or their

1533
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,720
state law depending on you know what

1534
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:16,239
they're trying to achieve right and

1535
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:19,118
that's really that's unique here we have

1536
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:21,719
a very interesting system here that is

1537
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,599
different from where I grew Oklahoma

1538
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:25,399
that you know the tribes are told on day

1539
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,200
one that memo will never apply to you so

1540
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,240
forget it that wouldn't happen here we

1541
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:33,199
have a stronger tribal presence so we

1542
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:35,959
got to like figure out something

1543
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:38,519
there a quick little sidebar uh you

1544
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:41,119
talking about Bashon in Washington I was

1545
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:43,480
cced on an email earlier this week from

1546
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:45,200
Dr Dominic Cora who's here and he was

1547
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:47,679
talking to somebody in Humble County and

1548
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:50,639
CC me on it and he was describing Bashan

1549
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:53,519
and he says bash's like like a liberated

1550
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:55,598
Zone he says cannabis and people who

1551
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:57,440
think it's just different you got to go

1552
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,760
there

1553
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,960
is a very high

1554
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:04,760
compliment we've got time for two more

1555
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:08,440
questions yes so when we think about

1556
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:11,359
cannabis on a genetic level and I know

1557
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,480
that what little resarch people talk a

1558
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:16,078
lot about cannabis having these

1559
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:19,480
thousands of genetic structures is

1560
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:22,960
cannabis a potential for gene

1561
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:26,760
therapy uh gene therapy is when you use

1562
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:30,400
a vector uh to introduce new genetic

1563
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:33,359
material usually a virus to to introduce

1564
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,760
new genetic material into the subject

1565
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:38,598
usually a human host that has a genetic

1566
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:42,359
disorder uh and you try uh usually

1567
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:44,359
they've used various forms of polio HIV

1568
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:47,719
um some forms of those viruses that are

1569
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:50,598
really good to get into the cells um

1570
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:54,118
cannabis genome U you know as a plant

1571
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:57,838
genome um its genes there are there are

1572
01:04:54,119 --> 01:05:00,640
remnants of uh let's see what is it

1573
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,078
um well no I I I don't know of any

1574
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:06,920
genetic overlap I was going to tell you

1575
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:08,760
CB1 receptor Gene which is a you know

1576
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,960
one of the most widespread receptors in

1577
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:15,440
our brain

1578
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:18,519
um there is a bit of that DNA in the in

1579
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:21,358
the spirro that causes lme

1580
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:24,880
disease actually some of the spyroy that

1581
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:26,798
causes Lyme disease as DNA is in cv1

1582
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:30,720
that's that's there

1583
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:32,960
some ancient overlap of that bacteria

1584
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:36,399
when it was infecting us its DNA got

1585
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,798
transferred into the human cv1 this is

1586
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,880
some this is in some medical journal I

1587
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:43,199
found in Switzerland and there's some

1588
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,798
interesting hypothesis about about the

1589
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:48,199
seasonality of

1590
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:49,440
schizophrenia uh diagnosis and and bl

1591
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:50,558
who you know people like to make all

1592
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,358
kind of theories but that there is

1593
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,480
something overlap there and I don't know

1594
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:58,078
to it but there was definitely a lot of

1595
01:05:54,480 --> 01:06:01,318
there's cross talk in nature between

1596
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:03,359
pathogens and hosts Genetically speaking

1597
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:06,079
uh when we consume cannabis we aren't

1598
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:09,199
getting its DNA into our

1599
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,760
system um but is it altering our way

1600
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:14,719
that our body does gene expression

1601
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,319
yes so that's that's that's how it's

1602
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:20,519
therapeutic it can be in that way but

1603
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:22,679
for something like if you if you have a

1604
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:25,798
genetic disorder if you were to start

1605
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:28,919
gene therapy with a host could you

1606
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:31,278
multi-generations later that that's gone

1607
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:34,559
is cannabis the potential for

1608
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:37,798
that to start changing the way the

1609
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:40,680
genetic structure of a person responds

1610
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:42,199
to things so we know sometimes genetic

1611
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:44,159
mutations start happening because of

1612
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:45,639
outside sources so could cannabis

1613
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:47,078
reverse those effects and do the

1614
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:49,679
opposite

1615
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:51,278
so exhibit a you have a host who has a

1616
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:52,879
genetic disorder you give it to them it

1617
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:54,679
kind of treats they have a Next

1618
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,160
Generation you give the Next Generation

1619
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:57,639
treatment even though they're affected

1620
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:59,798
and then by the third generation you

1621
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:03,558
don't have an affected

1622
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:03,559
potentially we'll talk more in

1623
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:09,679
your last questiona super quick have you

1624
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:13,079
had any personal contact with

1625
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:16,318
Dr no I have not

1626
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:18,000
please I I I would I actually no I take

1627
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:21,278
that back I did meet her I did meet her

1628
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,400
in Seattle in 2006 at in Kane Hall she

1629
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:28,519
was there with a talk with Sati Kumar

1630
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:31,798
yes that I remember yes n she seed

1631
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:34,119
