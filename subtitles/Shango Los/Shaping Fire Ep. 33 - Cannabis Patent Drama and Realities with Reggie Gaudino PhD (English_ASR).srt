2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,289
working in any part of the cannabis

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,759
industry is arduous no matter your role

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,410
you're gonna be working hard because

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,719
every single cannabis company is a

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,149
start-up this applies especially to

7
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,368
cannabis breeders quality breeding of

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,528
stable cannabis cultivars is a huge

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,300
amount of work it doesn't take much to

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,518
simply introduce a female plant to a

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,469
male plan and make seeds but a serious

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,659
breeder has a wealth of experience in

13
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,659
cannabis bonnie terpenes the weather

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,820
grower needs customer expectations and

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,828
marketing they also have to put in long

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,200
hours and many seasons to sift through

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,850
seeds to find the best Fino possible and

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,829
the damn thing is they are the ones

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,020
easiest to rip off because cannabis

20
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,299
genetics is a wild place with

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,520
insufficient regulation nearly no case

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,769
law and at its most basic it is

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,199
incredibly easy to pop a seed of someone

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,270
else's life work cross it with some bag

25
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,948
seed your already own and boom you have

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,410
something to market you know some folks

27
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:03,479
don't even bother making that cross some

28
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,789
folks just make seed of someone else's

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,890
strain rename it and sell it right

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,479
through as if it's their own and this is

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,269
the shady stuff that happens before you

32
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,459
even get into corporate cannabis big AG

33
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,829
and everyone's attorneys get involved

34
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,719
cannabis genetics is like its own high

35
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,879
drama TV series that's gonna play itself

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,769
out brutally over the next 15 years

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,019
until some best practices get

38
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,879
established if you want to learn about

University in st. Louis

71
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,579
studying transcriptional regulation of

72
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,140
ribosomal RNA today we're going to be

73
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,250
talking about cannabis patents and other

74
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,989
intellectual property

75
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,150
welcome to the show Reggie thanks Jango

76
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,710
thanks for having me here again you're

77
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,170
taking a big chance of having me back so

78
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,550
I think well one of the reasons I like

79
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:45,869
having you on this show Reggie's because

80
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,580
you're a firebrand and I know you're

81
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,349
gonna tell me the truth regardless of

82
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,910
its political implications so I'm glad

83
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,460
that you are willing to come back and

84
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:55,169
and talk some truth so you know I want

85
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,120
to start off very at the top with

86
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:59,219
patents because the number one question

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
or concern that I get from growers

88
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:05,580
cannabis enthusiasts and breeders all

89
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:08,699
over the country is that how can people

90
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,980
be patenting cannabis when you can't

91
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,739
patent nature and they say it's just

92
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,239
impossible our cannabis is safe and yet

93
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,980
you know there's a lot of smart people

94
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,750
who are saying that there are things to

95
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,250
be concerned about so let's start there

96
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,189
what's actually happening that's

97
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,989
allowing people to patent plants so it's

98
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:30,599
it's a little confusing right so so it's

99
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,610
not that you can't plant patent plants

100
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,659
you can't patent a naturally-occurring

101
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:39,570
plant that you just find in nature okay

102
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:41,099
however cannabis has stopped being a

103
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,959
naturally-occurring plant that you just

104
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,699
find in nature since we stopped just

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,520
growing landraces right so as soon as we

106
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,949
started breeding and specifically

107
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,590
selecting for higher THC contents

108
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:55,229
something happened right which is known

109
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,569
and patent speak as but for the hand of

110
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:59,129
man right so so what ends up happening

111
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,870
is that you can take a naturally

112
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,299
occurring plant and then you do some

113
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,739
selective breeding and you push it in a

114
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,780
direction that didn't occur naturally

115
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,849
and now it's not a naturally occurring

116
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,159
plant anymore it's actually a plant that

117
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,049
has been read specifically and once you

118
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,699
get to that point it's no longer a

119
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,668
naturally occurring plant it may be

120
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,370
based on that unnhhh Eicher but but you

121
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:22,918
know what you find in nature and what

122
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,288
you create by a directed breeding

123
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,269
program are not the same so that that's

124
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:28,209
the difference

125
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:31,399
so where's the threshold on that because

126
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:34,098
you know what was the first time someone

127
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,168
took an Effie plant an Afghani plant and

128
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:38,629
crossed it with a Thai plant and we got

129
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:39,500
a feet I was that first cross of two

130
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,379
landraces

131
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,000
technically patentable because it didn't

132
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:46,490
happen in nature or is there a threshold

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,639
to how much you need to change the land

134
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,038
races before it is passed and patentable

135
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,978
so there is no well-defined threshold

136
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:57,288
typically you know if you were to take a

137
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:59,240
bunch of land races that let's say

138
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:01,568
existed on you know you have two

139
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,220
different land races that say ones in

140
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:07,129
Texas and so it's technically a u.s.

141
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,509
land race and ones in Mexico a couple

142
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,598
hundred miles away and it's technically

143
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:14,330
a Mexican land race and they can

144
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:16,639
pollinate each other and if you were to

145
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:19,098
go into that field where let's say some

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,098
Texas pollen landed in a Mexican field

147
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:24,288
and you were to find one plant that

148
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:27,168
looked different from all of those

149
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:30,110
plants in that field you would be able

150
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:32,689
to take that plant and patent it because

151
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,479
it's not the same as what was growing

152
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:37,279
naturally around it so the short answer

153
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,408
to your question is yes

154
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,468
that very first cross would have been a

155
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:44,899
patentable cross and the only reason why

156
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:46,718
nobody has patented cannabis going back

157
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,859
is because not because it's been illegal

158
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:50,899
but because the patent off has hid

159
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,810
behind the fact that it was an an

160
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:55,638
illegal planet and an illegal activity

161
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,168
to do anything with it and so therefore

162
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,449
they were like oh well if nobody's going

163
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:02,629
to ask we're just not going to say right

164
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,370
so but as soon as anybody called the

165
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,990
Patent Office and asked the question can

166
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,908
you patent cannabis the answer was yes

167
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,949
right so so now we get to the question

168
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:11,449
that you're asking which is you know so

169
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,699
where does it stop being a naturally

170
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,960
occurring let you know plant it stops

171
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,449
being a naturally occurring plant when

172
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,689
you can find one difference in a field

173
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,430
of everything else being the same so and

174
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,709
that it's weird that it occurs that way

175
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,780
but in the patent law especially for

176
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:30,258
plant patents if you were to go through

177
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:33,258
a field and found like a thousand of a

178
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:36,110
certain strain and there's only one of

179
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,300
some other strain that would technically

180
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,129
be patentable because it's it's it's

181
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,360
novel from all the other ones that occur

182
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:47,149
by nature right so it's kind of a gray

183
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,919
area or it's kind of a ill-defined area

184
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:52,158
but yes anything that would not

185
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:54,168
naturally occur by you know in nature

186
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:58,069
would technically be patentable so

187
00:06:54,168 --> 00:07:00,678
taking a ruderalis or taking a an Afghan

188
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,598
tie and mating it with a Southeast Asian

189
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:04,038
because those things would probably not

190
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:05,959
happen because of the geographical

191
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:08,778
distance yes that is a patentable to

192
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:11,209
cross that threshold sounds awfully low

193
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:13,038
man I got to tell you and and I'm gonna

194
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:15,468
ask you to kind of flip positions

195
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,118
because I know that you are a you know

196
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,788
you are a keep the the cannabis plant

197
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:22,309
free person and you want that IP to stay

198
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:23,538
in the hands of development but I'm

199
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:26,990
going to ask you for a second to

200
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:29,628
advocate the the opposing position so so

201
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,050
the people you don't as a longtime

202
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:35,119
cannabis guy and you know advocate I

203
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,119
don't like the idea of patenting

204
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:40,369
happening and yet I know good people who

205
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:43,039
are moving in that direction so will you

206
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:46,519
just explain what the what the argument

207
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:49,699
is from the patent makers side on why

208
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:51,800
they believe that patenting these

209
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,179
genetics are good for the industry and

210
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,968
then and then after you make that case

211
00:07:53,178 --> 00:08:01,578
well we'll take it apart okay okay so

212
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:04,129
let's start from the perspective of the

213
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:06,199
the investment that's required to create

214
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:10,069
new strains right so think about it you

215
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,838
have to take you know you get to find a

216
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,059
suitable germ plasm and if you in if

217
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:15,978
it's not in your own germ plasm right

218
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,969
you have to go buy it or license it from

219
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,498
somebody it's going to be a cost

220
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:21,408
associated with that you have to grow it

221
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:23,959
up then you have to take and find a good

222
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:25,308
strong male or okay let's just say so

223
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,959
you have to find a good strong female on

224
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,789
a good strong male okay and and and

225
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,860
whether or and there's a cost associated

226
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:34,788
with finding those right then you have

227
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,818
to do the cross and as we know right the

228
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:39,019
reason why the cannabis industry is is

229
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:43,068
essentially promulgated on the whole

230
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:45,948
idea of clones is because getting a

231
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:48,528
phenotype and then and then breeding so

232
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:50,088
that phenotype is pure is a very

233
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:54,080
difficult thing and it almost never

234
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:57,200
happens in cannabis right right so so

235
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,700
in order to get to that point where you

236
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,250
can have let's say something that is

237
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,200
patentable in a way that you that really

238
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,149
make sense the patent right so and what

239
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,870
do I mean by that so a utility patent

240
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:13,730
gives you the strength of being able to

241
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:17,360
patent everything associated with that

242
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,159
plant from the seed to extracts to

243
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,110
edibles anything associated with that

244
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,639
strain if it has if it represents that

245
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,050
that chemical profile or whatever the

246
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,569
claims work for that particular strain

247
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:29,599
is covered and everything that's derived

248
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,730
from that plant a plant patent doesn't

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,879
give you that a plant patent only gives

250
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,879
you that thing right it gives you that

251
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:44,419
what I say it gives you that you know

252
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:47,289
one claim and it's for the plant as

253
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:49,370
shown as described you can't get any

254
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:50,659
chemical information into it you can't

255
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,299
get any of these other things and

256
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:55,850
because of that you can't protect the

257
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:57,829
seed you can't protect the extracts you

258
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,670
can't protect any of that thing you all

259
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:03,830
you get is the vegetative plant right so

260
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:06,799
so if you are interested in preserving

261
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:09,410
the entire product line around a

262
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,299
particular new strain you have to go

263
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,679
after utility so what does that mean

264
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:14,149
that means that you have to have more

265
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,500
than just plant that ax you have to have

266
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,959
some chemical analyte data you have to

267
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,159
be able to describe why it's novel so

268
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,450
now you can see that there's a whole

269
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,620
bunch of investigation that goes into

270
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,140
this and a whole bunch of money that

271
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,269
goes behind that if you take an example

272
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:28,159
of Monsanto which is you know obviously

273
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,980
we all consider that the the Dark Lord

274
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:35,199
evil empire but but but the reality is

275
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:38,690
is that you know they are have a very

276
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,970
same business plan they spend a billion

277
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,700
dollars a year in plant research in

278
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,860
order to be able to protect that

279
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,750
investment in research you have to have

280
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,289
some assurance that you're going to be

281
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,450
able to have the right to be the only

282
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:55,309
one to sell that product because you

283
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,840
spent all the money to make it right so

284
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:58,639
when you look at it from that point of

285
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,930
view it's not necessarily an evil thing

286
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,720
right and they're not going out there

287
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:05,120
and patenting corn right they're

288
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,830
patenting corn that they have put a lot

289
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,789
of time and effort and resources into

290
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,520
making

291
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:13,069
very special right unique different from

292
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,840
everybody else's the same thing applies

293
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,520
in cannabis right so here we are we have

294
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,980
a bunch of guys who are trying to go and

295
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,110
build a better turf but better

296
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,360
cannabinoid but this that the other

297
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,330
thing well that requires a lot of time

298
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,990
and energy phenotype hunting breeding

299
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,879
right so if you want to protect the

300
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,440
whole entire thing you have to get the

301
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:36,080
plant to the point where you can have

302
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,210
the information and the genetics in the

303
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,480
chemistry to be able to pack those

304
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:44,240
things and protect them right and you

305
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,370
know they're the only way to do that

306
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,039
after you've put all that money and time

307
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,350
into it is through a patent right so and

308
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,839
and and I know it sounds like a horrible

309
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,529
thing because you know we want the plant

310
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,090
to remain free right but if I'm given a

311
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:01,850
choice between do I want the plant to

312
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,980
remain open source and free or do I want

313
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,980
the people who spent all their time and

314
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,560
energy building this industry having a

315
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,690
future revenue stream when the likes of

316
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,549
the Dow and Monsanto's come to town and

317
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,520
can do everything for free because it's

318
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:20,120
all open source I'd rather have our guys

319
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,909
patent it and have a future right so so

320
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,620
yes you know it depending on how you

321
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:27,199
look at it it could be a bad thing but

322
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,669
it's also the way businesses play it's

323
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,400
the way agricultural you know industries

324
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:36,319
have been built and for us to think that

325
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,699
in the patent industry we're not going

326
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,650
to have to play by those rules is I

327
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,170
think foolish on our cards right so all

328
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:44,959
right so so let me go let me do a quick

329
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:48,199
summary here so so essentially a like

330
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,900
like most agriculture the the reason the

331
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,950
patent people are who are coming in want

332
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:57,289
to patent their novel versions of

333
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,629
strains is because they put a hell of a

334
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:01,879
lot of money doing huge sorts for

335
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:04,309
genetics and using all this technology

336
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,159
assisted not necessarily GMO but just

337
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:08,839
like laboratory testing try to to bring

338
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,329
these novel strains that are like listen

339
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,980
we've put you know six figures into

340
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,780
developing this we need to be able to

341
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,389
recoup so that we can pay off our

342
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:20,029
investors and so they want to patent it

343
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:21,199
so that they can preserve some value so

344
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,970
but but then you know

345
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,470
kind of shifted a little bit so it's not

346
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,320
necessarily for when I getting from you

347
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,300
the patents that are bad it's actually

348
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,570
who's gonna hold them because it sounds

349
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:35,269
to me like you're also saying that

350
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:38,000
patenting by the Heritage farmers to

351
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:40,759
keep it open source is actually probably

352
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,860
a good thing the question is who is

353
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,960
making the patents the the green rushers

354
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,720
who are coming to take advantage of

355
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,670
these you know 40 years of hybridization

356
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,850
in my is am i picking up what you're

357
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:55,250
putting down yeah absolutely yeah i

358
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,460
think you know we need to touch base on

359
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:03,080
a few other you know pieces that you

360
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,940
know make it the more the the more

361
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,270
directed argument and that more directed

362
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,400
argument is is that you know what's out

363
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:12,980
there right now and this is you know

364
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,079
patents peak right so there's a one-year

365
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,810
bar right so once something is offered

366
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,759
for sale commercial sale and it doesn't

367
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:21,979
even have to actually be sold right if

368
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,250
there's a contract offering for sale

369
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,430
that's made public and that contract is

370
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,710
then not signed but the contract but the

371
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:34,159
offer was made in a public way right

372
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:36,410
that's it the clock starts ticking so if

373
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,029
that is not filed within one year in the

374
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:42,559
united states you can't file it it

375
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:45,889
becomes open source right further if you

376
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,899
have any expectations to be able to

377
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,480
patent that strain anywhere else in the

378
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,509
world you can't even do that as soon as

379
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,039
you offer for sale you lose the right to

380
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:56,269
file anywhere else in the world other

381
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,620
than the united states the united sates

382
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:01,460
the only one that has that one year

383
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,889
window right so so when you look at it

384
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,350
from that perspective right so what

385
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:08,779
should be happening is is that these

386
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,860
people who have all this open source

387
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:17,240
stuff should be trying to develop their

388
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:19,550
next next greatest thing and then that's

389
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,259
where you start putting your fences in

390
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:23,299
the ground right because anything that's

391
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:24,169
already been sold is available for

392
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,149
everyone right

393
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:28,240
that means monsanto and I said it's the

394
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:30,470
last time we talked right yeah

395
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,060
Monsanto Dow those guys can go to the

396
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,649
dispensaries and just buy one of

397
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:34,829
everything often to dispensary shelves

398
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,409
and they don't have to pay it

399
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:40,230
thing because it's open source it's been

400
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:43,019
sold they can't protect it all they have

401
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,850
to do is go pay that $15 or $20 for

402
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,199
that's that cut off of the dispensary

403
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,360
shelf they can take that back to

404
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,980
Monsanto and do all their stuff with it

405
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,060
do all their breeding with everything

406
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,980
else that they buy from every other

407
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,759
dispensary right so how do you avoid

408
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,440
that becoming the paradigm you avoid

409
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,750
that becoming the paradigm by those same

410
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,840
people who have developed these 40 years

411
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,940
of hybridization now they do it the way

412
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,730
everyone else do it does it their next

413
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,500
set of crosses they do it in a way that

414
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,470
they can track it they can document it

415
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,590
and then they get some chemical data and

416
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,500
maybe some genetic data under their belt

417
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,850
and file before they release it changes

418
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,159
the way we do business in the cannabis

419
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,580
industry right but it's the way that we

420
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,379
help litter the ground with patents that

421
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,509
are held by the people inside the

422
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,090
industry to keep the green rushers from

423
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:35,220
coming in and taking everything away so

424
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:37,620
it sounds like the way that you know

425
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,960
people continue to look back like oh I

426
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,629
made these strains that I'm in love with

427
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,220
over the last 10 or 20 years that that

428
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:47,460
looking back and trying to preserve

429
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,230
those is not the successful path forward

430
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,720
what is the successful path forward is

431
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,779
to look into the future and either

432
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,620
create new crosses that are based on

433
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:01,230
your old-school genetics or just move

434
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,179
forward with new genetics but the idea

435
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,620
is to what what you know what have you

436
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:06,750
done for me lately you know what what

437
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,879
are you doing that's new and novel and

438
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:13,140
that's where breeders should be putting

439
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,300
their attention yes however I wanna I

440
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,560
want to say in order to make this really

441
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:21,029
a rock-solid kind of industry for us

442
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,619
those same people who are going to be

443
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:25,049
working on the new genetics and working

444
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:29,159
off of their own their old strains so

445
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:31,289
this is where kind of somebody has to

446
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,000
absorb the cost right and this is gonna

447
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:37,680
sound horrible

448
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,220
but a lot of this is only partially

449
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:45,299
successful unless somebody anybody

450
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:47,610
everybody okay chips in and we can

451
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,720
identify the genetics that are already

452
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:51,509
exist and tried

453
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,669
put a name on them or a sequence to them

454
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,619
or something so that we can say look

455
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,020
this is the database that we started

456
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:00,418
with so anything that exists in this

457
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,069
database Monsanto or Dow or whatever

458
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,360
they can't just come in and say oh look

459
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:04,740
this is a new strain that we made

460
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,750
ourselves because we'll have the

461
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,390
information that says ah sorry that

462
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,480
existed already right so so it's a

463
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,130
two-fold approach cataloging what exists

464
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,610
so that we know where we started and

465
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:20,580
then moving forward in a way that allows

466
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:22,469
us to protect the new stuff and do it in

467
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:25,168
a way that allows us to get there before

468
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:28,380
the likes of the big AG people come

469
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:32,370
that's how we protect you know the

470
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,710
industry from the patent perspective and

471
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:36,389
keep it kind of you know within the

472
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,850
industry right because if we don't do

473
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,409
that and I know it sounds gloom and doom

474
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:43,019
right and I say the same thing last time

475
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:47,400
it sounds gloom and doom but without

476
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:48,509
this you know it really becomes a

477
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,190
free-for-all

478
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:52,740
right and we don't need a free-for-all

479
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,860
what we want is to be able to protect

480
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,079
what we've built and then have a stake

481
00:18:55,859 --> 00:19:00,658
in this industry as it grows and moves

482
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,000
forward right if if it's a free-for-all

483
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:04,799
I can guarantee the likes of Monsanto

484
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,720
and Dow and all instant jente and all

485
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,929
those people who'd like to come in they

486
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,970
do it better faster and more accurately

487
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:14,940
than we do it's it's if that's what they

488
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,279
do right so for so we have to protect it

489
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,038
because we know what will happen when

490
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,029
they come right so time to take get the

491
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,548
head out of the sand

492
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:24,928
and and play this game like any big

493
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:29,839
business would play this game

494
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:33,840
that sounds so expensive to to you know

495
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:36,990
determine the code of the genome of each

496
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,119
strain that everybody has developed that

497
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,829
they want to preserve I mean how much

498
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:45,029
how much does it cost to do that kind of

499
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:47,038
analysis per strain nowadays well so

500
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,589
there are different levels of genetic

501
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:52,908
analysis and and you can some of it is

502
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:55,740
targeted sequencing some of it is is

503
00:19:52,909 --> 00:20:01,409
short read you know whole genome some of

504
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:04,769
this long stuff right well so that's a

505
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:06,419
great question because I'm going to give

506
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:10,109
you the the here's where the other shoe

507
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:12,059
drops all right what I'm talking about

508
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,969
is what I would call responsible

509
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:16,889
patenting in the cannabis industry we

510
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,500
haven't had to do this in any other

511
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,210
agricultural industry and the reason is

512
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,548
is that because there's no other plant

513
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,590
on the planet that is as complex and has

514
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:28,230
as many active compounds as cannabis

515
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:32,038
right so normally when you you take like

516
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:34,829
say let's say corn and you you know you

517
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:36,658
don't emit junky GMO but you do directed

518
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:39,779
breeding to increase the sugar content

519
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:41,309
or to make it you know so it has you

520
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,079
know when you pop it it has bigger

521
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,190
kernels or whatever some of those things

522
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:49,139
can be achieved by just you know

523
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:50,880
directed breeding programs right so but

524
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,309
but in at the end of the day you're

525
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,049
changing one component or you're you're

526
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:56,038
looking at one component you know you're

527
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:57,629
change looking have a change in the

528
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,750
sugar content or a change in the size of

529
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,580
the kernel right but now we are faced

530
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,069
with a cut with a plant that has 500

531
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:09,898
active compounds and we are only looking

532
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:13,139
at a couple CBD THC right maybe you know

533
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:15,089
right so so when you have 500 active

534
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,220
compounds and you're only looking at 2

535
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:19,230
or 3 compounds how do you get any

536
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,880
granularity in five or six or seven

537
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,829
hundred or a thousand strains right

538
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,120
because at the end of the day if you

539
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:26,189
don't look at it enough compounds they

540
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,558
all overlap which is exactly what we see

541
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,850
right now in the patent record of those

542
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,548
strains that have already been you know

543
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:34,319
filed on and and issued right so they

544
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:35,579
all have kind of because they're only

545
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,629
looking at a couple things they kind of

546
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:41,158
overlap right so you know so what has to

547
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,880
happen is and then actually it's funny

548
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,649
that we're having this conversation

549
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,450
because on Friday this week I'm actually

550
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:46,648
talking in front of the American

551
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,830
intellectual property lawyers

552
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:51,839
Association exactly on the pitfalls to

553
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:54,058
successful patenting in cannabis right

554
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,658
so and one of the points that I make is

555
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:59,700
that you know when you can take a strain

556
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:01,799
you take you know the same genetics and

557
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,840
you grow it in five different places

558
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,779
with your five different conditions you

559
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,459
get five different you know answers that

560
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:11,129
that tells you that you need to go

561
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,610
deeper than just you know what does the

562
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,299
genetics

563
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:18,329
look like because now because of the the

564
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:20,970
paradigm or the you know the only

565
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:24,480
equation that really that biologists

566
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,529
ever use is genotype plus environment

567
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,819
equals phenotype right so right so

568
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,139
that's that's the basic you know biology

569
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,450
math for us because I always think about

570
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,750
it as nature versus nurture right you've

571
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,569
got it exactly yeah yeah right so it's

572
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:42,599
exactly it so so now but the problem is

573
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:45,389
is that so we already know that even the

574
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:48,689
genetics cannot define a specific

575
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:50,190
chemical analyte output I have data on

576
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,150
it like I have the same genetics grown

577
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,740
in four different places

578
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,980
gave me four different responses right

579
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,308
so that means that responsible patenting

580
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,589
so that you can protect a strain and a

581
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:03,569
particular set of genetics and a

582
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:06,899
particular chemical outcome that means

583
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:08,369
you have to include in that claim the

584
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,840
way you grew it because if you don't

585
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:12,178
grow it that way it comes out with a

586
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,279
different output right so so now we're

587
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,500
looking at a plant that is unique unto

588
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,899
itself in terms of how you have to go

589
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,079
about patenting it and this is where we

590
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,370
are in the dark ages right now because

591
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:25,710
patent examiner's and the Patent Office

592
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:27,928
don't understand cannabis they don't see

593
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,730
these problems because they've never had

594
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:31,980
to deal with these problems because no

595
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,620
other commercial agricultural plant has

596
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,150
been the same right it's been let's

597
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,918
change this thing let's change that

598
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,750
thing and we'll get a patent on it right

599
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,000
now we're not really trying to change

600
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,220
things or we kind of are trying to

601
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,380
change things but we don't know where we

602
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,210
started and we don't have it defined

603
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,490
endpoint because any given genetics can

604
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,130
do any different thing depending on how

605
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,380
you grow it right so so the only way to

606
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,480
get successful and you know

607
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,419
forward-looking patents that allow us to

608
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,240
have people going after specific strains

609
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:06,000
that do specific things is to have a

610
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,269
level of detail that has never been

611
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,609
asked for in plant patents which is so

612
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:14,129
so that's what we're looking at trying

613
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:16,649
to force a change on the patent office

614
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:19,530
and why I'm going to go speak to the AI

615
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:23,000
pla on fridays because you know this is

616
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:25,440
this is a huge thing that people in the

617
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,929
patent office who are issuing these

618
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,769
hands don't understand they they clearly

619
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:31,110
don't understand

620
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:33,628
they also not understand that when we

621
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:36,719
call something a strain we have not done

622
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:39,990
the stable the stabilization that is

623
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:45,419
almost always part of the process these

624
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:47,970
are ethnic exactly right so so so we're

625
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:51,419
trying to put cannabis into plant

626
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:53,879
patents and utility plant patents you

627
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,639
know that have been crafted around a

628
00:24:53,878 --> 00:25:01,469
certain paradigm and cannabis does not

629
00:24:56,638 --> 00:25:04,378
fit at all right so so we have we we got

630
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,319
a lot of work to do and and it would be

631
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:10,558
very good if the people on the cannabis

632
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:13,648
side understood and helped educate by

633
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,418
going the extra mile providing the data

634
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:18,089
to the Patent Office that I'm talking

635
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,429
about so that it's already there right

636
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:23,069
and it helps create the way things have

637
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:24,509
to be done because otherwise we're going

638
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:27,178
to end up with the kind of patents we

639
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:29,159
already have have you know issued that

640
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:31,169
came out of the biotech institute LLC

641
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,669
right so and I know that's another topic

642
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:36,500
so I don't want to jump into our next

643
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:39,899
topic but you know but a direct result

644
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,028
you know of not understanding how to do

645
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:43,709
this correctly is what we see with those

646
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:45,659
paths that were already issued right on

647
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,308
so we're gonna talk about biotech

648
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:49,500
Institute after the break but before we

649
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:50,940
go to the first break I just want to get

650
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,220
a number out of you because I know that

651
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,558
there's people who are listening who see

652
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,329
themselves as wanting to protect the

653
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,788
genetics that they've worked hard on of

654
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:02,579
now and going forward and you're

655
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:04,200
referring to the the kind and amount of

656
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:06,778
data that you want to be able to send to

657
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,600
the Patent Office what is the price tag

658
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:13,829
to get that research done for one

659
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:16,378
cultivar so for one cultivar and you

660
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:18,418
know and again I said there's different

661
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:22,378
levels of analysis and that's a ballpark

662
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:29,100
figure yeah yeah so anywhere between I'd

663
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:32,449
say 500 to 5,000 dollars right and and

664
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:36,118
and let me let me say why it's so wide

665
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,740
depending on the type of strain you're

666
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:39,298
dealing with you may be able to do

667
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,249
something which is called target

668
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,450
sequencing because you oh no why it's

669
00:26:41,249 --> 00:26:43,919
different and you just have to look

670
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,840
there and say look all these other

671
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,278
strains have this this strain has this

672
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,308
this is why it's different okay

673
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,169
when you do however a regular let's take

674
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,489
what which is what most of the cannabis

675
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,919
injury does let's take that female on

676
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:57,269
this male and or maybe that female in

677
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,350
three or four males and throw them into

678
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:00,058
a room together and see what we get

679
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:04,259
right so now you're looking at a

680
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:05,940
situation where in order to get the

681
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:08,220
information you have to go much deeper

682
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,320
you have the sequence much deeper the

683
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,798
deeper the level of sequencing the more

684
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:16,710
it costs okay and then you add to that

685
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:19,079
whether or not you're doing it for

686
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,649
private commercial use or for public

687
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,658
domain use right so a lot of at least in

688
00:27:22,648 --> 00:27:26,819
the programs that we offer it's depo we

689
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:29,580
have a commercial price and in a

690
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,710
research price so we've been able to

691
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:35,009
secure through our partner that if the

692
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,960
data that we generate is donated to the

693
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:39,089
public domain so that we can use it in a

694
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,308
publication after you file the patent

695
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:42,778
right so so you you know we let you do

696
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:44,278
what you're going to do first and we use

697
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:46,558
it and accumulated data and then we

698
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:49,440
publish publish it later after it's not

699
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,388
an issue for you right we can offer a

700
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,359
much cheaper price because it goes into

701
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:56,219
the research domain right and so that's

702
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:58,019
typically half price that gets you in

703
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,690
between 1,500 and 2,000 dollars for a

704
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:05,190
whole genome sequencing of a long read

705
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:06,749
right 5,000 would be the single the

706
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,340
single cultivar price where you keep it

707
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:10,259
for yourself and nobody else has it but

708
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:11,908
you and your patents right so so that's

709
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,019
the prices that I've been given to work

710
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:15,119
with through the university that I

711
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,069
partner with right so but that's for

712
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:19,439
long read you don't always need long

713
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:21,778
read if you are using strains that are

714
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,379
already decently characterized and now

715
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:27,210
you just need to find in a couple of

716
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:28,469
regions where the differences might lie

717
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,788
because you've taken strain and strain

718
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,069
but you put them together and you want

719
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:34,648
to see what unique parts of a and B they

720
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:37,618
got together you can do short read

721
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:40,319
sequencing which is comes in at you know

722
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:41,730
around 800 to a thousand and then

723
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,079
there's targeted sequencing which is

724
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,509
good just looks at specific genes and

725
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,240
comes in around 300 to 500 right so so

726
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:51,990
that's why there's that wide range but

727
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,950
it's based on what you need and and what

728
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,349
you're trying to get

729
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,480
so right on that's fantastic analysis

730
00:28:55,349 --> 00:28:59,759
I'm gonna be parroting those words from

731
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,829
you a lot over the next six months I can

732
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,059
be assure you of that

733
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,439
so we're gonna take our first short

734
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,089
break and be right back you're listening

735
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,670
to shaping fire and my guest today is

736
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:10,230
Reggie Godinho chief science officer and

737
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,720
director of genetics and intellectual

738
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,099
property at steep hill

739
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,450
now that the health benefits of terpenes

740
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:17,579
have become well-known in the cannabis

741
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,350
industry people everywhere are looking

742
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:21,689
for the purest terpenes without

743
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:23,339
adulterants the problem with most

744
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,410
terpene providers is that they're not

745
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:27,659
sourced naturally and instead are made

746
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:30,870
as a byproduct of refining petroleum and

747
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,880
that's so sketchy the terpenes sold by

748
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:35,669
true terpenes are entirely different

749
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,980
they are certified organic non-gmo and

750
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,380
food grade that means they are extracted

751
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,360
from real plant sources there are no

752
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,400
solvents of any kind used during the

753
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,949
extraction process they are distilled

754
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,070
only with steam that's right only steam

755
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,080
in fact terpenes from true terpenes are

756
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:54,000
so pure that you can eat them not only

757
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,919
that but you can stack them with better

758
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,200
results - what I mean is

759
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,330
other companies terpenes have got a few

760
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,220
percent of impurities and when you stack

761
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:03,779
those terpenes to make a blend you're

762
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,600
adding a variety of impurities that

763
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:09,509
degrade your final product true terpenes

764
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,159
also has strain-specific terpenes for a

765
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:13,319
wide range of cannabis strains like

766
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,779
Durbin poison sunset sherbet and

767
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,819
granddaddy purple true terpenes has

768
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:19,740

you all

791
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:10,319
ready understand the importance of

792
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,209
living soil when growing cannabis when

793
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,398
you have active microbe communities in

794
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:16,469
your substrate you go way beyond simply

795
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,168
fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and

00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:16,169
has been extensively tested by Colorado

822
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:18,749
growers and independent laboratories

823
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:21,449
mammoth pee is proven to increase growth

824
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:22,618
and enhance blooming one of the great

825
00:32:21,449 --> 00:32:24,329
things about supplementing with

826
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:26,189
microorganisms is that they won't

827
00:32:24,328 --> 00:32:28,528
compete with whatever fertilizer program

828
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:30,359
you're already running simply dose on

829
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:32,669
top of your fertilizer schedule for

830
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:34,288
increased benefits to learn more and to

831
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:38,389
find out where you can buy mammoth pee

832
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:38,388
near you check out their website at

833
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:43,699
www.opm.gov/tribalprograms

834
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,450
but let's let's really hit that hard and

835
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,960
then the first time I heard you talk

836
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:31,140
about this was in that article that came

837
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,048
out last fall in September of 2017 in GQ

838
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,419
magazine titled the great pot monopoly

839
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:39,179
mystery written by a man to Chicago

840
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:41,040
Louis and it blew everybody away and you

841
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:44,880
know you and I had talked about patents

842
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,730
generally earlier on on the podcast but

843
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,160
suddenly this article that kind of went

844
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:53,460
down a rabbit hole of he-said she-said

845
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,669
about patents that were starting to

846
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,490
place take place freaked out everybody

847
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:02,309
but nearly nobody had any actual

848
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:04,109
information so it was all like rumor

849
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:06,589
mill and gossip upon gossip and I hate

850
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:10,378
that stuff but but in that GQ article

851
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:12,179
you an email that you wrote is mentioned

852
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:14,579
that you wrote to some of the other

853
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,829
heavy players in the industry waving

854
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,779
your hand and raising a red flag to

855
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:21,840
these new patents that you saw coming

856
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,780
out and why this needed to be addressed

857
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,639
immediately to keep an open market so

858
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,440
will you take us back to that time and

859
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,440
explain what was in the email and why

860
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:36,990
you felt so motivated to get the word

861
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:39,418
out yeah so okay so I have besides being

862
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:41,368
you know a scientist the reason women

863
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:42,898
actually vote in directive intellectual

864
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:44,669
property is because for the last 22

865
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,969
years that's what I have done right in

866
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:50,868
the biotech sector written and/or

867
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:53,309
managed portfolios and before I came to

868
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:57,358
steep hill I was the senior patent agent

869
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:58,679
at sequin home right so and so you know

870
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,420
the first thing I did when I came to the

871
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,099
industry was like okay you know let's

872
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,920
see with a patent landscape looks like

873
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,449
because I'm about to embark on some

874
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,740
research as the director of genetics and

875
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:09,750
I don't want to know what's out there

876
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:12,839
what I'm up against right what pitfalls

877
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:15,449
to avoid so you know I did what any

878
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,420
decent patent practitioner would do and

879
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:20,579
you do you know your your patent arena

880
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,680
searches patentability searches you know

881
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,009
what just general landscaping to see

882
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:30,449
what the industry looks like and in that

883
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:32,580
initial analysis I found you know at the

884
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:33,750
time it was only three applications that

885
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:40,679
had been submitted by the

886
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:42,480
tech Institute LLC you know and my you

887
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:44,759
know and was interesting because they

888
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,760
were they were hidden patents right so

889
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,150
it was you know a method pet under

890
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,290
breeding and I forget the title and we

891
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,289
can look it up afterwards but you know

892
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:56,639
but it was essentially it was breeding

893
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:58,769
cultivation so on and so forth you know

894
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,809
forward you know Pat you know for

895
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:04,769
cannabis right when I went through the

896
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:07,469
claims and this is this is a a protip

897
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:09,360
okay so don't ever pay attention to what

898
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:12,839
the title of a patent says because

899
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:18,690
they're purposely written to be vague

900
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:20,579
and and misleading okay so you can't

901
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,929
ever tell what's gonna be in a patent

902
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,279
from looking at the title you have to

903
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,799
look at the claim structure right so

904
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,390
when I did my my search I actually was

905
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,210
looking for things that had cannabis or

906
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:32,159
marijuana in the claims and then I

907
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,409
filtered it down from there and and in

908
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:37,019
that filtering process I found these

909
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:38,909
three patent applications and when I

910
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,619
looked at the claims my jaw hit the

911
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:44,489
floor because the first one I looked at

912
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:48,210
was a hybrid cannabis plant having a BT

913
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:51,000
/ BD phenotype what does that mean right

914
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:54,809
so there was a few other things attached

915
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,909
to it but B TBD just means that it can

916
00:36:54,809 --> 00:37:01,889
make both you know it's the genetic you

917
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:04,949
know nomenclature that we use for

918
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:10,440
specific genotype / phenotypes in

919
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:13,169
cannabis so bt is THC dominant BD is CBD

920
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,179
dominant b TBD mean it's a heterozygous

921
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,820
means that it can make both THC and CBD

922
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:20,039
so that claim structure the way it was

923
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,980
written was basically claiming anything

924
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:25,559
that could make THC and CBD well holy

925
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:29,070
crap that's like it that's the entire

926
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:31,409
medicinal cannabis industry right right

927
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:34,890
so so that was a bit on the alarming

928
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:41,489
side and and so I I you know looked at

929
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:44,670
them I talked to some other people in

930
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:47,039
the industry and and and none of them

931
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,490
think knew that they were existent right

932
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,960
so

933
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:50,519
like literally everybody talked to had

934
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,690
no clue they were there right and as I

935
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:55,079
said they were still application at the

936
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,300
time that had not been issued so while

937
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,369
they were still applications I started

938
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:04,860
to contact people like Steve DeAngelo

939
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:06,000
and some other people and I think what

940
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,769
really happened in the very beginning

941
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,780
was is that you know we were so

942
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:10,949
concerned about rescheduling that people

943
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,960
weren't really paying attention to this

944
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:14,519
even though I was making I was talking

945
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,199
to some people about it it was in the

946
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,000
height of the whole rescheduling thing

947
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,069
right so like two years ago and so

948
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,239
people just didn't understand or just

949
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:25,890
didn't care and because of that nothing

950
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,299
was done and then the first patent

951
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:30,750
issued and that was the one where there

952
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,180
was the B team so BD phenotype that and

953
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:37,170
and the limitations were where it had to

954
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:40,379
have at least three percent THC a or THC

955
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:43,380
and at least three percent CBD and at

956
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,180
least one percent terpenes right well

957
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,190
I'm sorry but if you're a cannabis

958
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:49,559
grower and you can't hit three percent

959
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,090
THC and three percent CBD or one percent

960
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,250
terpenes you shouldn't be a cannabis

961
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:55,769
grower right like like honestly right so

962
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,750
so the limitations ended up not being

963
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:59,369
limitations right and so this is where

964
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:02,760
I'm going with this whole thing right so

965
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:04,799
because the patents themselves were

966
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:09,180
actually written quite well they look

967
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,100
just like any other good plant utility

968
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:13,169
patent which means that it was done by a

969
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:15,269
reputable firm with a good patent lawyer

970
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,610
right if I had written these claims

971
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:20,460
myself or these patents myself I would

972
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:22,920
have done it exactly the same way so the

973
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,480
paths are well written and therefore

974
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,059
that means that the claims that were

975
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,550
issued are bonafide claims that will be

976
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:34,349
hard to challenge right so so that's

977
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:36,780
part number one it's a it's a well

978
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:39,289
written patent and if I had done it I

979
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,750
would have done it the same way right so

980
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:44,130
now how did they get over on the patent

981
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,599
office they got over on the patent

982
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,760
office because it looks like a patent a

983
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,980
good plant patent it has limitations

984
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,980
that if you don't know the industry look

985
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,469
like limitation so when you say 1%

986
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,110
terpenes where beta mercy and is not the

987
00:39:55,469 --> 00:40:00,149
dominant terpene right well anybody

988
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,090
who's a cannabis grower knows that you

989
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,860
can manipulate

990
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:06,130
terpene profile by the growing regime

991
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,750
right right so so now we have

992
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,300
limitations and claims that are not

993
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:12,039
limitations and they were not caught by

994
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,720
the Patent Office because the Patent

995
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:16,000
Office doesn't understand cannabis right

996
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:18,099
and they experience they don't have the

997
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,349
experience to realize it's over broad

998
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:22,569
they're like all it reads okay but they

999
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:25,329
don't have any sense of context right

1000
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:28,539
and this is exactly what happens anytime

1001
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:31,690
a new arena is opened up in the Patent

1002
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:33,809
Office this is not unique to this when

1003
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:36,610
we went to molecular data based

1004
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:39,639
Diagnostics a lot of crappy patents were

1005
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,880
issued then too and when we went to you

1006
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:44,440
know different types of engineering

1007
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,599
though you know when we opened up

1008
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,970
business method patents every time a new

1009
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,920
arena of patents is opened because

1010
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:54,669
there's nobody who knows how to examine

1011
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,200
them the same exact thing happens so the

1012
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,840
fact that this happened in the cannabis

1013
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:00,609
industry is not the issue right because

1014
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,460
it happens in all industries where there

1015
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:05,050
is not enough expertise for the patent

1016
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,300
examiner's right I remember during the

1017
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:10,660
dot-com boom you know there was a patent

1018
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,880
for it clicking on an image that took

1019
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:13,929
you to a advertisers website you know

1020
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,250
they're like patting that it was like

1021
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,199
well that's that's the entirety of the

1022
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:20,769
internet you know yep exactly right so

1023
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,960
so and it's because you have a weakness

1024
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:25,449
in the examiner force that doesn't

1025
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,340
understand the incoming new technology

1026
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,769
right that's exactly what happened here

1027
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,660
so they saw a plant patent that looked

1028
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:34,869
like a bonafide plant patent but it was

1029
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:38,500
applied to F once well in any other

1030
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:40,900
agricultural you know domain

1031
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,760
you don't patent an f-1 you patent a

1032
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:46,780
stabilized true breeding strain because

1033
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,910
that's how you get your ROI right so

1034
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,980
Monsanto doesn't sell F once Monsanto

1035
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:53,739
sells stabilized true breeding strains

1036
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,780
that have gone to the point where you

1037
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:59,469
may not even be able to get you know

1038
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:01,960
fertile seeds from the cross right so so

1039
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:03,609
that's how how deep they go into these

1040
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,170
things right and so because they don't

1041
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,990
do that in the cannabis industry right

1042
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,400
but the Patent Office doesn't understand

1043
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:12,399
they don't do that well what happened

1044
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,710
they issue patents that look right but

1045
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,960
can't possibly be right because

1046
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,480
f1s and we don't do any of that other

1047
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,699
stabilization right so so this is where

1048
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,960
one of those things where a patent

1049
00:42:21,699 --> 00:42:28,210
practitioner saw and I'm not trying to

1050
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,570
call the guy out but I guess I kinda am

1051
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:34,119
right so when I saw it I was actually

1052
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,400
really offended that a patent

1053
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,858
practitioner would pull the wool over

1054
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,740
the patent offices eyes like that but

1055
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:44,559
then again it's because I didn't do it

1056
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:46,179
and I wasn't first right so he somebody

1057
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:48,088
beat me to the punch and so I can't say

1058
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:51,368
that it's not sour grapes right so

1059
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:52,809
because as I said it's a well written

1060
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:54,550
patent and I would have probably done

1061
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:57,400
the same thing and you know even though

1062
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:59,740
all of us who haven't done it are all

1063
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,300
you know bent out of shape about it you

1064
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:03,848
know you kind of have to give the person

1065
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,369
like ball or credit I mean that's a

1066
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:08,588
freaking hustle you know Ted wait to

1067
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:10,990
have your ear I mean I don't like it and

1068
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:12,789
I'm you know I work against it but you

1069
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:15,789
also got to be impressed like dang yo

1070
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:18,460
that's some game yeah absolutely and and

1071
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:21,039
and to have the balls dude it was like

1072
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:23,800
and what balls he has to pull that one

1073
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,358
off and you know it's like putting your

1074
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,269
arms around the whole cake and saying

1075
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:31,420
this is all mine exactly dude exactly so

1076
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:34,150
so but you know so and I guess you know

1077
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,980
two things though right so as of right

1078
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:39,130
now the patents are really teeth 'less

1079
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:41,679
right so so in any good regime right

1080
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,510
enforcement has to have teeth right so

1081
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:44,858
you can't really enforce anything

1082
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,630
because it's still Schedule one so it's

1083
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:49,630
federally illegal right so they have

1084
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:51,460
these patents and until it gets switched

1085
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:54,460
to they can't enforce it the patents

1086
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,199
really may not mean much right but we

1087
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,608
know it's coming it's not gonna take

1088
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:59,710
twenty years so the patents will still

1089
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:02,319
be enforced when that time comes and

1090
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,449
then we have an issue right so then we

1091
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,580
have to see whether or not it can be

1092
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:08,230
challenged because they're invalid so

1093
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:10,000
the question then becomes is who's gonna

1094
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,679
put the money up for that and that's

1095
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,570
kind of where everything fell apart

1096
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,659
because we started this part of the talk

1097
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:19,300
about my letter right so I wrote the

1098
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:20,500
letter where I did this analysis and I

1099
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,119
looked at all the claims when I said

1100
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,769
well this is the potential impact and

1101
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:25,539
the potential impact is large right

1102
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:27,699
because if you're looking at all THC CBD

1103
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,509
producing strains right and that's the

1104
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,250
focus of most

1105
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,980
additional cannabis now one-to-one

1106
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:36,280
ratios you know two to one one to two is

1107
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:38,289
what but it's you know always THC CBD

1108
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,660
hybrids tend to be the most interesting

1109
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:43,929
for the medicinal aspect of cannabis

1110
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:46,869
you know you now have a situation where

1111
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:49,480
a good 50 to 75 percent of potentially

1112
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:52,329
all medicinal cannabis moving forward is

1113
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,949
claimed right but it gets worse because

1114
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:55,569
that was just the first one that came

1115
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:57,969
out down the pipeline pipeline right

1116
00:44:55,570 --> 00:45:02,260
they now have three actually that they

1117
00:44:57,969 --> 00:45:04,269
have for now so since then three other

1118
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,490
members of this portfolio have issue

1119
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:08,980
they now have four issued pens which

1120
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:11,109
means that it's even a harder job to

1121
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,230
invalidate them and the patents have

1122
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,910
become even broader so now they have one

1123
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:19,059
that's a medicinal cannabis patent it

1124
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:22,750
doesn't even claim the phenotype right

1125
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:26,079
there's no BT bead B sub T sub D in it

1126
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:28,659
it's just a hybrid cannabis plant making

1127
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,279
at least one point five percent THC a

1128
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:32,259
and 2 percent or 3 4 whatever the

1129
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,940
numbers were right so they even took out

1130
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:41,350
the requirement for that genetic you

1131
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:42,519
know limitation so is it possible under

1132
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:44,889
certain growing conditions together

1133
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,650
Tate's a dominant plant to produce CBD

1134
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:50,409
well yeah it's probably possible to do

1135
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:54,610
that right would it fall under the B sub

1136
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:57,250
T B sub D genotype technically it might

1137
00:45:54,610 --> 00:46:00,010
but it doesn't have to if if it's a

1138
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:01,869
trick of you know for instance you know

1139
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,430
let's look up the other way high CBD

1140
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:06,039
plants right you get to a point with

1141
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:09,909
high CBD plants where it doesn't matter

1142
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:13,840
you know how hard you try you will get

1143
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:15,599
some THC produced right so you know I

1144
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,769
could imagine that there are probably

1145
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,529
THC dominant plants that do the same

1146
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:23,349
thing right so so now think about this

1147
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:25,120
that means that somebody with completely

1148
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:27,329
unrelated genetics to the genetics that

1149
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,130
went into the patent could infringe

1150
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:33,549
because they happen to grow their their

1151
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:35,829
own genetics the wrong way so in my mind

1152
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:38,289
that's not what the patent office meant

1153
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:40,989
to do right that's that's just it

1154
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:41,949
possibly be possible right that some guy

1155
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:44,289
inadvertently

1156
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:49,210
not even you know using the same

1157
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:52,929
starting genetics is is um you know it's

1158
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:55,659
going to be you know on the hook for

1159
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:58,088
this you know it can't be right and and

1160
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:59,920
the way things are written out it that's

1161
00:46:58,088 --> 00:47:01,739
exactly the way it works and that and so

1162
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,460
we got to do something about it

1163
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:05,679
absolutely have to do something about it

1164
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:08,409
and I would think that after they got

1165
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:10,449
their first patent and it was over broad

1166
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,769
and after everybody was done drinking

1167
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:13,629
this champagne they're like well what

1168
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:16,179
can we do now and so they come with

1169
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:18,010
three more that are increasingly even

1170
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:20,529
more broad and they're probably

1171
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,720
expecting some pushback but my goodness

1172
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:25,150
they've they've taken so much real

1173
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,909
estate of the industry at the beginning

1174
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:30,070
everyone who wants to play defense has

1175
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:32,348
to push them that much farther back now

1176
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,119
and there's probably some amount of

1177
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,530
their patents being reinforcing right

1178
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:38,108
like once you have one if you have four

1179
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:38,680
it makes your first one look better yeah

1180
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,750
absolutely

1181
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:42,639
there is that so and you get the kind of

1182
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,838
backdoor into protection well we didn't

1183
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,449
get it there but we have this other one

1184
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:48,670
that has this and it's not there but now

1185
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:51,068
they have to invalidate - right so and

1186
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,349
the more patents in suit the more

1187
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:55,210
expensive it becomes right so you know

1188
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:57,670
and then think about it this way right

1189
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,380
so he's got these things in hand right

1190
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,750
if somebody is going to start to

1191
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:04,240
challenge him what do you do you go get

1192
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:05,739
a deep pocket partner like Monsanto hey

1193
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,000
help me help me fight these things off

1194
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:08,679
and I'll you know let you use the

1195
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,599
patents or you or you can buy them cheap

1196
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:12,848
or you know whatever so you know there's

1197
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:15,099
all sorts of possible scenarios right

1198
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:18,579
and the only reason I bring up those

1199
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:21,789
scenarios is because if at any point the

1200
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:25,089
idea was for them to get these things to

1201
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:27,550
protect the industry from the likes of

1202
00:48:25,088 --> 00:48:30,039
those big AG companies you'd think that

1203
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:32,079
not therefore they would have donated it

1204
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:34,509
to the public domain already which they

1205
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,369
have not done which tells me that

1206
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,069
they're in this for their own personal

1207
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:41,289
gain right so yeah that's an interesting

1208
00:48:39,068 --> 00:48:44,259
point - right like you know these overly

1209
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:46,480
broad patents if if we had them and they

1210
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,220
were in the public domain we'd be like

1211
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,170
ah these are really good patents they're

1212
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:51,699
very broad and they protect you know

1213
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,260
medical marijuana now and into the

1214
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:54,399
future that's great but since somebody

1215
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,380
else has got the

1216
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,990
and looks like they're motivated by

1217
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:02,110
profit and could potentially flip it to

1218
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:04,659
a you know mega aggron core that that

1219
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:08,860
that suddenly it looks way less way less

1220
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:11,109
attractive well and and and and way less

1221
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,450
like it was done for the correct you

1222
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:15,820
know philanthropic reasons right so this

1223
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:18,869
is definitely this wasn't done in the

1224
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:21,580
best interest of the industry at least

1225
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:23,409
yeah right on so so that's good let's go

1226
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:25,239
back to your original email before we go

1227
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:27,819
to the second break here oh yeah your

1228
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:29,349
your original email was looking to like

1229
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,210
like sound the alarm

1230
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:33,400
raise the flag bang the dome that this

1231
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:36,070
was going on and from what I know about

1232
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,889
you I'm assuming that your kind of point

1233
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:41,710
of your email that you sent out to to

1234
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:44,409
these big industry players where hey we

1235
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:48,369
need to pull together right now and do

1236
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:50,349
some fundraising and stand up to this

1237
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:54,759
because we're either gonna a need a

1238
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:58,000
whole bunch of money to do do the the

1239
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,910
the long read on the present cultivars

1240
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,110
to protect them or be and more likely

1241
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:09,190
somebody's gonna have to stage you know

1242
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:12,910
a lawsuit to to quash these patents when

1243
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:14,200
they become enforceable and and with

1244
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,329
that assumption that's what you were

1245
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:18,189
trying to get people to consider did

1246
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:21,309
anybody consider I mean is there anybody

1247
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,980
working on that it seems like a level of

1248
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:27,119
participation and cooperation that our

1249
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:29,710
industry hasn't quite pulled off yet so

1250
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:37,179
you know me very well Shango because

1251
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:39,250
it's exactly what I did so yeah so I put

1252
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:41,769
together the letter I sent it around I

1253
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,449
went to the people like you know Steve

1254
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:45,730
DeAngelo Stevie Angelo pulled some

1255
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:49,389
people together I ended up speaking to

1256
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:51,490
somebody at one point who was campaign

1257
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:54,219
adviser to Hillary Clinton we tried to

1258
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:56,679
put it on into that domain to get it to

1259
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:57,759
be publicized that way they were an

1260
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:01,299
interesting because it was too

1261
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,760
controversial a topic I put together a

1262
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,170
seminar at the new West summit I don't

1263
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,420
know if he you know they're they hold

1264
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:10,990
that it's you know kind of the

1265
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:12,730
all kind of you know that big data kind

1266
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:17,048
of meeting for the cannabis industry

1267
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:21,010
it's held every year and so to two years

1268
00:51:17,048 --> 00:51:24,009
ago I did exactly that I did a a seminar

1269
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:29,920
on the patents and then by invitation

1270
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:33,099
only right we had gathered using new

1271
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,920
frontier the data company we had get and

1272
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:38,470
we had gathered a number of people for a

1273
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,048
private seminar that occurred afterwards

1274
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:42,368
it was another two-hour session and in

1275
00:51:41,048 --> 00:51:45,639
that session I had actually brought in

1276
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:47,619
an outside law firm I brought in Marcin

1277
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:51,190
Koster because we have dealings with

1278
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:53,108
them and and I had them give a

1279
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:55,750
perspective of what it would take the

1280
00:51:53,108 --> 00:51:59,369
challenge depends the kind of money the

1281
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:02,619
the approach because you know

1282
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:04,510
challenging you know validity of a

1283
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,760
patent in the court of law is expensive

1284
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:08,290
right so there are lesser expensive ways

1285
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,329
called in to portage of view or export

1286
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:12,750
interview they're there that are

1287
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:15,910
available through the patent office that

1288
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:17,949
come in way cheaper but at the end of

1289
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:20,588
the day was still gonna cost between 300

1290
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:22,328
to 700 thousand dollars right and they

1291
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:23,679
were asking that a war chest be put

1292
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:26,048
together or at least like half a million

1293
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,838
dollars so they could go through and do

1294
00:52:26,048 --> 00:52:32,380
the whole entire thing and and as soon

1295
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:35,679
as they came to the number part the

1296
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:38,108
entire meeting broke down and it became

1297
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,940
a discussion of well who's going to

1298
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:40,989
contribute and what about the people who

1299
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,608
don't contribute because they're gonna

1300
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:44,318
get benefit anyway so they're good what

1301
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:46,690
do we do about the Free Riders and and

1302
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:49,539
literally it became more about how to

1303
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:52,568
you know who's gonna put in what and and

1304
00:52:49,539 --> 00:52:54,009
how how the people who put in what they

1305
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:55,029
put in were gonna benefit more than the

1306
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,099
people who didn't put anything else who

1307
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,930
were the Free Riders I like and I

1308
00:52:57,099 --> 00:53:00,609
couldn't believe it I like looked at the

1309
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:02,798
room as it devolved into this side

1310
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:04,480
conversation and I was like holy [ __ ]

1311
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:07,509
dude what's going on here

1312
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,510
right III sorry about that I thought I'd

1313
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:13,150
turn that off III I literally was

1314
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:14,290
floored right and how far do you write

1315
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,119
because the position that you're

1316
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:18,039
bringing to them is is you know

1317
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:19,010
somebody's trying to take the whole pie

1318
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:21,139
we want to make

1319
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:23,150
pi available to everybody do we want to

1320
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:26,059
do this and then alike yeah but if we

1321
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:29,750
pay for it we want the whole pie right

1322
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:35,570
right so and so what ended up happening

1323
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:37,550
was nothing absolutely nothing so I so

1324
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:40,280
and there was instant because you know

1325
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:43,400
the GQ article talks about Mowgli and

1326
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,570
and how Mowgli went to you know Amanda

1327
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,639
well I had actually talked to Amanda

1328
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:48,890
about this previously and I was actually

1329
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,719
the one who actually told its told

1330
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:52,219
Mowgli about it and Mowgli and I were

1331
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,319
kind of at opposite ends of this thing

1332
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:56,000
for a while even publicly when we

1333
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,010
finally realized I'm like dude you know

1334
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,889
we're saying the same thing you want

1335
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:02,990
them to protect stuff now to keep them

1336
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:05,029
away I'm telling them that they should

1337
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,709
protect stuff now the way to do with is

1338
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:08,390
to patent it before other people patent

1339
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,309
you're against patents but at the end of

1340
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:13,339
the day we want the same thing we want

1341
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:14,960
the industry protected you know you seem

1342
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,240
to think it can be done a certain way

1343
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,210
I know patents a little bit better and

1344
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:22,849
I'm telling you we should do it this way

1345
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:25,550
that's and - I mean knowing both you and

1346
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:27,380
Mowgli homes from Philo's Biosciences I

1347
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:29,060
can see how you guys probably approach

1348
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,760
this differently you're all like let's

1349
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:35,389
defensively patent it and he's all like

1350
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,610
patent suck and so I see and and I agree

1351
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:38,900
with both of those right and so I can

1352
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:42,170
see how it probably took you guys a

1353
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,220
little bit of you know mental jostling

1354
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:46,039
to find out you're actually on the same

1355
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:47,419
page right and I and just for the record

1356
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:49,039
I love Mowgli dude Mowgli it's an

1357
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,579
awesome dude and I love talking to him

1358
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:54,309
and and he and I you know have you know

1359
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:57,349
a deep respect for each other right so

1360
00:54:54,309 --> 00:55:00,019
and so you know it was important for me

1361
00:54:57,349 --> 00:55:01,940
to me to make him understand what I was

1362
00:55:00,019 --> 00:55:04,099
trying to say right I'm like dude I'm

1363
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:07,039
not trying to tell people to patent

1364
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:09,019
stuff to keep it from being open-source

1365
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,269
I'm trying to tell them the patent stuff

1366
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:15,199
because if they don't they won't have

1367
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:16,940
anything left right so you know so and

1368
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,129
at the end of the day I said by the way

1369
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:21,470
if we all patent stuff and we say that

1370
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:23,500
you know and we can let anybody you want

1371
00:55:21,469 --> 00:55:26,509
to use those patents for free right so

1372
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,829
once we own a patent we can give anybody

1373
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:31,280
the right to do anything we want with it

1374
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:32,960
right but by having that pen you keep

1375
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,810
the people you don't want from do

1376
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,369
it from doing it right so so this way at

1377
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:38,630
least we have some control right and

1378
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:40,309
that's all I was trying to do is like

1379
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:42,559
make sure that we in the industry

1380
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:44,480
maintained control of what we spent so

1381
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,400
long building because dude these guys

1382
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,349
are gonna come in and with their fancy

1383
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,470
labs and whatever they're gonna like

1384
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:53,780
like like literally out-compete us in

1385
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:55,699
the matter of years right the amount of

1386
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,830
money that these big companies can dump

1387
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:59,809
in with their you know thousands of

1388
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:02,420
scientists on their payroll there's no

1389
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:04,190
way the industry can compete if they get

1390
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,269
into it right the only way to slow them

1391
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:08,750
down is to put up all these picket

1392
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:10,009
fences and say it and make a feel full

1393
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,108
of land mines that they have to

1394
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:14,570
negotiate around right that's how you

1395
00:56:12,108 --> 00:56:16,009
slow them down we're gonna take a short

1396
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,539
break and be right back you are

1397
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:19,790
listening to shaping fire and my guest

00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:29,779
that finding good business partners

1403
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:31,609
vendors and allies is an essential part

1404
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,500
of your role and building your business

1405
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:34,699
in a new industry like cannabis doesn't

1406
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,309
always make that easy

1438
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,278
certainly still enjoy smoking joy

1439
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:51,288
I moved over to using vaporizers about

1440
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:52,849
three years ago the high was a little

1441
00:57:51,289 --> 00:57:54,740
different than burning the flower and in

1442
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:56,778
the end I decided I preferred it for

1443
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:57,528
daily use especially because I have

1444
00:57:56,778 --> 00:57:59,778
asthma

1445
00:57:57,528 --> 00:58:02,449
more importantly though I could taste my

1446
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:04,159
flower so much more it's hard to express

1447
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:06,048
to you how significantly different

1448
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,899
cannabis with a good terpene profile

1449
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:10,670
tastes when vaped instead of burned i

1450
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,289
have brought my vape with me to visit

1451
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:14,240
growers and they are astonished by the

1452
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:15,528
clarity of taste and they say they feel

1453
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:17,989
like they're tasting their flower for

1454
00:58:15,528 --> 00:58:20,690
the very first time the air vape

1455
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:23,149
vaporizer from air vape usa.com is a

1456
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:25,490
great device to use on the go or at home

1457
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,480
when you pick it up and feel satisfying

1458
00:58:25,489 --> 00:58:28,608
like a medical device

1459
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,829
it isn't flimsy like many vape Tsar I

1460
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:32,960
like how the flower is inserted in the

1461
00:58:30,829 --> 00:58:34,880
top instead of the bottom so travels are

1462
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,470
shorter path to my mouth with the

1463
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,269
cannabis at the top I get a hit that

1464
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:40,219
feels more substantial even though I'm

1465
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:42,828
just inhaling vapor and not full-bodied

1466
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:45,199
smoke since I used this vape for flower

1467
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:46,700
hash and concentrates I really liked it

1468
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:48,858
that digital control for the temperature

1469
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:50,268
is right there on the front three clicks

1470
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,250
of the button and it fires up to the

1471
00:58:50,268 --> 00:58:54,828
temperature I specify really quickly and

1472
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:57,259
discreetly you know vape concentrates

1473
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:58,759
are milder experience than dabbing but

1474
00:58:57,259 --> 00:59:01,039
you still get the potency in your hit

1475
00:58:58,759 --> 00:59:03,740
also the taste is great as would be

1476
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,690
expected with a low temp tab I love that

1477
00:59:03,739 --> 00:59:06,679
this vape gives quick little vibrations

1478
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:09,289
when it gets to the right temperature

1479
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:10,759
that way if I'm chatting or distracted

1480
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:13,220
while it's heating up it lets me know

1481
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:15,798
when it's ready if you are ready for a

1482
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:18,528
nice pocket-sized vaporizer consider the

1483
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:20,150
air vape the new air vape ex has just

1484
00:59:18,528 --> 00:59:22,250
come out and it's gorgeous and it

1485
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:24,460
includes many updates you can find more

1486
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:27,048

1487

usa.com welcome back you are listening

1488
00:59:27,048 --> 00:59:30,139
to shaping fire I'm your host Shango

1489
00:59:28,849 --> 00:59:32,028
Louis and our guest this week is Reggie

1490
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:33,618
Godinho chief science officer and

1491
00:59:32,028 --> 00:59:36,108
director of genetics and intellectual

1492
00:59:33,619 --> 00:59:38,720
property at steep hill so Wow

1493
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:41,328
we have shaken a lot of trees so far so

1494
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,879
we talked about why you know patenting

1495
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:45,798
people don't understand it and even the

1496
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,298
Patent Office is and yet there's still

1497
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:50,268
some patents that are coming out and

1498
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:54,048
they're not going to likely be held in

1499
00:59:50,268 --> 00:59:55,939
the open sector so that's all a drag but

1500
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:58,608
you know some people have successfully

1501
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,990
licensed their strains because they're

1502
00:59:58,608 --> 01:00:01,519
trying to

1503
00:59:59,989 --> 01:00:03,829
you know advance and make some money off

1504
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,110
of their life's work some folks more

1505
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:07,670
successful than others and I know that

1506
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:10,010
when I was at Emerald cup this year

1507
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,869
everybody was talking about this

1508
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:14,660
particular company in April research

1509
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:18,019
because several of the winning strains

1510
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:20,000
were licensed from them and so you know

1511
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:23,179
as you know cannabis people are

1512
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,550
everybody was was uninformed Lee talking

1513
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:28,219
crap about nei Pro research with without

1514
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:29,539
actually knowing what they do and so

1515
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:31,250
let's talk a little bit about the

1516
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:33,519
licensing of strains Reggie you know

1517
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:37,880
where where are we at now I have people

1518
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:39,739
successfully proven that you know that

1519
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:41,990
they own the strains that they have

1520
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:44,629
developed them themselves and then are

1521
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:48,529
successfully getting fees from company

1522
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:50,180
for using those genetics so there you've

1523
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:51,740
got a lot of questions there some of

1524
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:55,639
which I can't answer but what I can

1525
01:00:51,739 --> 01:00:57,349
answer is that yeah you can actually use

1526
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:59,420
the same you know we were talking about

1527
01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:00,769
DNA sequencing earlier and and what you

1528
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,849
need to get a patent well it's the same

1529
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:04,579
information that you would use for

1530
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:06,469
licensing right so and this gets back to

1531
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:08,389
being able to prove what's out there and

1532
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:12,019
was not out there right so if you as

1533
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:15,409
let's say a company want to have you

1534
01:01:12,019 --> 01:01:17,480
know a business where you build new

1535
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:20,389
strains and then license them as your

1536
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:23,510
own you know as your business model what

1537
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:26,358
you end up doing is you you get your

1538
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:28,700
germ plasm you do genetic analysis on

1539
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:30,319
your germ plasm right and you can and

1540
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:32,509
and it's probably a good idea to do

1541
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,670
genetic analysis on other you know

1542
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:36,350
related or non related germ plasm just

1543
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,539
to be able to establish a baseline right

1544
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:40,279
and by genetic analysis I don't know

1545
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:42,529
semi Nall ways sequencing although

1546
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:46,730
sequencing is the epitome of genetic

1547
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:49,280
analysis right so but you know once you

1548
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:50,389
have this Basel information the same

1549
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,430
information we talked about you know

1550
01:01:50,389 --> 01:01:54,049
what the cannabis industry needs you

1551
01:01:52,429 --> 01:01:56,989
then start your breeding program right

1552
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:59,600
and so now because you have the starting

1553
01:01:56,989 --> 01:02:01,399
material and now you have your your f1

1554
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:05,989
zaroor your even you know your later

1555
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:08,269
hybrids right so you can now do an

1556
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:10,159
analysis where you say okay this is what

1557
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:12,199
my offspring look like this is what the

1558
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,028
parents look like here's what some other

1559
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:15,158
random things

1560
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:20,139
look like look at my differences those

1561
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:21,459
differences are gonna boil down to what

1562
01:02:20,139 --> 01:02:24,548
I call the single nucleotide

1563
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:27,278
polymorphism or variants right so at any

1564
01:02:24,548 --> 01:02:29,108
given nucleotide position there's a

1565
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:32,650
possibility you will have a change there

1566
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:35,199
a polymorphism or a variant right so so

1567
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:36,608
when you develop a new strain even a few

1568
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:39,639
sets that you take let's say you take

1569
01:02:36,608 --> 01:02:45,278
you know you know Afghani and you cross

1570
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:47,650
it with you know you know a lambsbread

1571
01:02:45,278 --> 01:02:48,909
so you again you end up an Afghani bred

1572
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,789
right so whatever something like that

1573
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:54,459
well you can see what the snip calls

1574
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:56,829
will be in the in the Afghani you'll see

1575
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:59,408
what the snip calls will be in the you

1576
01:02:56,829 --> 01:03:01,929
know Jamaican lambsbread you'll see the

1577
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:03,759
where they overlap where they have the

1578
01:03:01,929 --> 01:03:05,559
same snip calls you'll see where they

1579
01:03:03,759 --> 01:03:09,400
have the different snip calls right and

1580
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:12,039
in that population will then be a unique

1581
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:15,039
snip table that's unique to that new

1582
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:18,519
germ plasm which is the offspring of you

1583
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:21,099
know a plus B right and every time you

1584
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:23,649
build a new strain you will end up with

1585
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:26,229
a new variant call table right and that

1586
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:28,358
variant call table is the proof behind

1587
01:03:26,228 --> 01:03:30,639
which you can say look this is unique to

1588
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:32,469
this nothing else has it here's what I

1589
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:35,168
started with the mom had this the dad

1590
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:37,059
had this that a la right and so now that

1591
01:03:35,168 --> 01:03:38,288
is a very defensible position and this

1592
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:40,089
is what I'm talking about in terms of

1593
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:41,859
what we need for responsible patenting

1594
01:03:40,088 --> 01:03:44,018
as well right it's the same information

1595
01:03:41,858 --> 01:03:46,869
that would be the basis of a strong

1596
01:03:44,018 --> 01:03:48,548
contract for a license right so that

1597
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:50,650
because now you have the markers you can

1598
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:53,288
show that this is unique to me

1599
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:56,798
I made this nobody else has it and now

1600
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:58,599
if somebody you know illegally trades

1601
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,579
that ourselves that and you're not a

1602
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:00,999
part of that License Agreement or

1603
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:02,979
whatever

1604
01:04:00,998 --> 01:04:05,438
you can go in enforcement and enforce it

1605
01:04:02,978 --> 01:04:07,658
because you have this unique thing it

1606
01:04:05,438 --> 01:04:10,149
you only gave it to this person under

1607
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:11,289
contract if it gets out from that person

1608
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:13,659
that means that he has breached that

1609
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:15,849
contract so we are seeing a lot more

1610
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:18,849
companies ask exactly for this kind of

1611
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:21,338
analysis as the basis of Licensing

1612
01:04:18,849 --> 01:04:23,259
because they see licensing as the quick

1613
01:04:21,338 --> 01:04:25,358
fix to patenting and it's actually

1614
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,469
pretty a pretty good approximation right

1615
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,358
so

1616
01:04:26,469 --> 01:04:29,679
because you can put these people under

1617
01:04:28,358 --> 01:04:32,019
contract and you can enforce that

1618
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:34,710
contract because you know regardless of

1619
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:38,050
whether you can enforce cannabis

1620
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:40,720
infringement at the patent level you

1621
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:43,119
have a contract under which you have set

1622
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,189
some terms right and if they breach that

1623
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,559
contract it doesn't matter what the what

1624
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:49,840
the the breach was they've breached the

1625
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,579
contract right so if the contract says

1626
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:53,858
you can't trade that plant because it's

1627
01:04:51,579 --> 01:04:55,210
mine and they do it anyway it doesn't

1628
01:04:53,858 --> 01:04:58,108
matter that it was cannabis because

1629
01:04:55,210 --> 01:05:00,760
that's not what you're that's not the de

1630
01:04:58,108 --> 01:05:02,559
that's not what the contract was is

1631
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,460
broken over the Condon was broken over

1632
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,349
cuz you did something you weren't

1633
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:08,710
supposed to do and under the terms of

1634
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:10,480
the contract right so I'm sure somewhere

1635
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:12,039
there will be some judge that will try

1636
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,869
to throw it out because it's based on

1637
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:16,269
cannabis but realistically this is

1638
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:19,059
contract law and it's not patent law

1639
01:05:16,269 --> 01:05:21,070
right so the contract says you can't do

1640
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:23,380
this if you didn't that then you've

1641
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:24,700
broken the contract so the fact that you

1642
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,700
did it with cannabis should be

1643
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:30,159
irrelevant so that so it's yes it's like

1644
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:32,379
Laird interests like yeah to be able to

1645
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:35,199
license it they need to have already

1646
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:37,180
patented it but the patented part is not

1647
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:38,500
know the nature of the Nommo oh you

1648
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:40,210
don't have to patent it to be able to

1649
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,400
license you just need to be able to line

1650
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:45,099
up no actually not oh that's interesting

1651
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,170
exactly so once you so Wow so this is

1652
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:49,630
kind of like a poor man's patent you can

1653
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:51,720
get the analysis done and and show where

1654
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:54,910
the I think you called it a clip point

1655
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,829
you know see that those line up thus

1656
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:59,469
proving that it's the genetics that you

1657
01:05:56,829 --> 01:06:02,519
did your work on and that is enough for

1658
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:05,739
you to start charging licensing fees

1659
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:07,989
right so now Wow so here's where here's

1660
01:06:05,739 --> 01:06:11,169
where the problem comes in because this

1661
01:06:07,989 --> 01:06:12,909
only works if you have stabilized your

1662
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:15,338
genetics and you can prove but if you're

1663
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:17,549
just trying to sell an f1 somebody else

1664
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:19,358
can create the same it can create an f1

1665
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,619
possibly create it with different

1666
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:23,069
genetics and end up with the same

1667
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:25,269
offspring right so this is why

1668
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:28,930
stabilized genetics and true breeding

1669
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:31,509
genetics are the paradigm in plant you

1670
01:06:28,929 --> 01:06:35,169
know agricultural you know business

1671
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:36,940
right because the only way to ensure

1672
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:38,740
that somebody doesn't get there by

1673
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:40,630
mistake is to have it so that it is a

1674
01:06:38,739 --> 01:06:44,959
true breeding strain right

1675
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:47,840
where your snip table will only be your

1676
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,470
snip table and it can be shown that it

1677
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:53,289
was there and locked in through X

1678
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:56,419
generations of breeding you know and

1679
01:06:53,289 --> 01:06:59,509
some guy randomly put a and B together

1680
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:01,909
but then a and B he will never be able

1681
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:03,800
to get that back because he hasn't you

1682
01:07:01,909 --> 01:07:07,279
know if he tries to sell fit or cross it

1683
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:11,630
he loses it right so so this is why

1684
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:15,440
again we want as an industry to move

1685
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:18,740
towards seed based growing and genetics

1686
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,809
right so F ones are great when you find

1687
01:07:18,739 --> 01:07:22,699
something but it should not be the

1688
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:25,250
be-all and end-all it should be the oh

1689
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:27,139
great I have a great f1 now let me do

1690
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:29,989
the work to make sure that I can find

1691
01:07:27,139 --> 01:07:33,139
the true genetics and stabilize it so

1692
01:07:29,989 --> 01:07:35,359
then it becomes my unique plant that I

1693
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:35,779
can then protect so let me ask you a

1694
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,309
question

1695
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:39,019
drilling into that a little bit Reggie

1696
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:43,309
so you know I have heard a couple people

1697
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:47,929
say that commercial cannabis agriculture

1698
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:51,980
will always be a clone or cut based

1699
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:55,129
because you cannot get the you know

1700
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:59,300
seeds to be uniform enough for

1701
01:07:55,130 --> 01:08:01,250
commercial mono cropping and for me I

1702
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:04,640
don't think that sounds like the truth I

1703
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:07,699
think that with more work you and moving

1704
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:09,170
beyond f1 working with commercial labs

1705
01:08:07,699 --> 01:08:11,149
and stuff people will be able to

1706
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:13,010
stabilize seeds enough so that they can

1707
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:15,680
use a seed get the vigorous growth and

1708
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:17,480
yet have each of the plants in the field

1709
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:19,939
be similar enough that they can handle

1710
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:21,739
them as a commodity would you do they do

1711
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:23,149
you agree that that there's you know

1712
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:24,949
it's just takes a little bit more than

1713
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:26,899
maybe not a little maybe a lot more work

1714
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:30,769
to stabilize these seeds well and that's

1715
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:34,609
where the industry is gonna be well I

1716
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:36,680
would I would say yes so so what when if

1717
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:38,630
you had asked me without all the other

1718
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,579
stuff if I thought that was dried say

1719
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:43,670
that's complete and total [ __ ] right

1720
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:45,380
so complete and total [ __ ] and

1721
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:48,980
whoever says that is clearly not a

1722
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:53,060
geneticist or a true you know plant

1723
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:54,289
breeder right and I hate to be the dick

1724
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,730
to say that but that's

1725
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:59,180
I mean I hear stuff like that and drives

1726
01:08:55,729 --> 01:09:02,479
me batty right so so you know any plant

1727
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:06,109
can be stabilized does it take a long

1728
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:07,789
time sometimes yes right and will it

1729
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:10,490
take longer if you don't have genetic

1730
01:09:07,789 --> 01:09:12,380
tools absolutely right but this is why

1731
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:14,719
you have cannabis companies like myself

1732
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:16,310
and Files and others that are doing this

1733
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,680
work so that we can build breeding

1734
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:20,240
markers and it's not and it's not just

1735
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,250
the breeding markers for THC and CBD

1736
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:24,229
because that's that's baby [ __ ] really

1737
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:26,720
that's the low-hanging fruit that and

1738
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:28,669
and people need to also realize that you

1739
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:31,159
can only breathe so much THC and CBD

1740
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:32,420
into a you know output in the plant

1741
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:34,338
before the plant gets sick and doesn't

1742
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:37,100
grow well in which case then you have an

1743
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:39,079
all over overall yield right so do you

1744
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:41,088
want a plant that puts out 40 percent

1745
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:42,619
but grows poorly or a plant that puts

1746
01:09:41,088 --> 01:09:45,318
out twenty eight percent and grows like

1747
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:47,449
gangbusters so your overall one acre

1748
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:49,250
yield is much higher right so these are

1749
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:51,798
the kind of things that people who are

1750
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:54,079
not plant biologists and plant AG you

1751
01:09:51,798 --> 01:09:56,149
know in the plant agricultural you know

1752
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:59,059
technology don't understand these things

1753
01:09:56,149 --> 01:10:01,549
right so so what is it that we're doing

1754
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:03,920
we're trying to actually find all the

1755
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:06,440
other genes that are not THC and CBD

1756
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,539
because in order to make a plant that

1757
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:09,829
has more Tate seed CBD you got to build

1758
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:12,109
it from the ground up you have to have

1759
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:14,720
it so it has more biomass so that it has

1760
01:10:12,109 --> 01:10:17,089
you no longer flowering time and all

1761
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:20,329
these other things right so to blindly

1762
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:21,619
look at just you know a gene family and

1763
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:23,449
think you're gonna make a better plant

1764
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:25,489
that way is is is not doing it the right

1765
01:10:23,449 --> 01:10:27,319
way right so now when you look at it

1766
01:10:25,489 --> 01:10:30,050
from that perspective you need the

1767
01:10:27,319 --> 01:10:33,019
breeding tool so that you can grow an

1768
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:35,090
overall healthier better yielding plant

1769
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:39,970
that has an increase in everything right

1770
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:41,930
and that is what the object of you know

1771
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:44,240
building stabilized genetics and true

1772
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:46,430
breeding genetics are and it's done in

1773
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:47,920
every plant because it can be done in

1774
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:51,920
every plant that's just a matter of

1775
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:55,180
organization and and dedication right

1776
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,470
and now and now you can add to that

1777
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:59,960
marker-assisted breeding because we have

1778
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:02,210
moved into the realm of where almost

1779
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:05,000
every commercial crop has been sequenced

1780
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:07,250
we have markers that we can follow and

1781
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,880
now we can do rapid generation cycling

1782
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,289
and

1783
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:12,770
we can do other things that help us

1784
01:11:09,289 --> 01:11:15,109
build better plants faster right so all

1785
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:17,840
of these things are done already and can

1786
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:19,279
be applied to cannabis right on you you

1787
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,489
got my attention when you said you know

1788
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:24,500
the dedication and efficiency or drive

1789
01:11:22,488 --> 01:11:26,599
whatever you said about you know getting

1790
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,520
this done and I think that this is one

1791
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,829
of the ways places that I get a little

1792
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,449
torn about licensing of strains because

1793
01:11:30,829 --> 01:11:35,479
you know the whole show we've been

1794
01:11:32,448 --> 01:11:39,349
talking about how we want you know the

1795
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:42,138
the over-broad cannabis patent to be in

1796
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:44,329
open domains so that everyone can use it

1797
01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:46,670
and and it doesn't because become

1798
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:49,039
individualized IP but at the same time

1799
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:51,079
you know you've got companies and and

1800
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:52,698
and I actually don't know exactly what

1801
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:54,350
neh Pro research is doing there's not

1802
01:11:52,698 --> 01:11:55,759
much you can read online even if you

1803
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,199
read the patents and I've got an

1804
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,610
invitation out to mark Lewis hopefully

1805
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:00,769
hopefully he'll come out on the show but

1806
01:11:58,609 --> 01:12:04,309
but you know I have to both like on one

1807
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:06,500
side I like the idea of the genomics

1808
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:09,020
being free but at the same time I'm I'm

1809
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:11,779
really impressed from what I about what

1810
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:14,750
I think NATO is doing where they are

1811
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:19,130
they're using technology dedication

1812
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:22,939
efficiency and skill to do a natural non

1813
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:26,060
GMO hybridization process really fast so

1814
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:28,339
they are you know they're developing

1815
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:30,739
these these strains with incredible

1816
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:33,860
terpenes that then go and win awards and

1817
01:12:30,738 --> 01:12:36,349
then charge people to use their strains

1818
01:12:33,859 --> 01:12:38,750
and I'm so torn right because I want all

1819
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:41,139
this stuff to stay in the in the public

1820
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:44,149
domain but at the same time as a

1821
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:45,920
cannabis well III guess I can't call

1822
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:48,109
myself a Canada's breeder as someone

1823
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,658
who's interested in cannabis breeding I

1824
01:12:48,109 --> 01:12:52,609
can't help but be impressed that they're

1825
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:55,250
pulling this off I mean anybody who does

1826
01:12:52,609 --> 01:12:57,109
you know dedication to a particular area

1827
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:59,359
and excels at it that's pretty

1828
01:12:57,109 --> 01:13:01,279
impressive and yet at the same time I

1829
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:03,019
want it in the public sphere it's it's

1830
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:04,880
it's hard to think about because I you

1831
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:07,730
know I want these companies to be able

1832
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,139
to recoup some of them you know not some

1833
01:13:07,729 --> 01:13:11,059
but I want them to make profit you know

1834
01:13:09,139 --> 01:13:12,949
on all their efforts and money they put

1835
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:14,539
into it but at the same time I want it

1836
01:13:12,948 --> 01:13:16,879
to be available to everybody that's a

1837
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:18,550
that's a that's a it's a sharp edge

1838
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,880
right there

1839
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:23,739
it is and that gets us back to our the

1840
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,440
first set of questions which was you

1841
01:13:23,738 --> 01:13:29,019
know Monsanto spends a billion dollars a

1842
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:31,210
year on research right are they supposed

1843
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:33,699
to just give that up to everybody for

1844
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:36,309
free how do they recoup that same thing

1845
01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:38,138
with neh Pro right so if if they're

1846
01:13:36,309 --> 01:13:40,090
using tools like I'm building here

1847
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:42,099
marker-assisted breeding rapid cycle

1848
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:44,139
generation and you know and we could

1849
01:13:42,099 --> 01:13:47,139
have gone down that path but I felt it

1850
01:13:44,139 --> 01:13:49,328
was a bad route for us right who's gonna

1851
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:50,679
use my genetic analysis services if they

1852
01:13:49,328 --> 01:13:53,500
think that I'm competing with them to

1853
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:55,569
build my own strains right so so I we

1854
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,849
chose the steep hill to stay out of that

1855
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:59,170
arena okay and just to offer the

1856
01:13:57,849 --> 01:14:01,779
services so that we could help other

1857
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:05,260
people do it right so they Pro is doing

1858
01:14:01,779 --> 01:14:08,529
it in-house I and again I did not know

1859
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:11,260
about it until the recent spate of their

1860
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:13,630
stuff that they won and and I looked

1861
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:16,889
them up as well after that and you know

1862
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:20,170
I mean more power to them they are doing

1863
01:14:16,889 --> 01:14:22,599
they're doing what Monsanto what Dow

1864
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:24,699
with those companies do that they built

1865
01:14:22,599 --> 01:14:26,860
a better mousetrap and then they license

1866
01:14:24,698 --> 01:14:30,339
it out for everybody to use right that's

1867
01:14:26,859 --> 01:14:33,670
that's how business works yeah you

1868
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:37,059
really it's unfortunate right so because

1869
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:39,969
because the the problem is is that we in

1870
01:14:37,059 --> 01:14:41,889
the industry have not been prepared for

1871
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:44,139
business to work that way right we were

1872
01:14:41,889 --> 01:14:46,328
caught unawares and now unfortunately

1873
01:14:44,139 --> 01:14:48,039
the people who do it better than us are

1874
01:14:46,328 --> 01:14:50,799
gonna come in and try to take it from us

1875
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:52,300
so that's that's the sore point and you

1876
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,029
know coming up and earning my stripes

1877
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:57,070
through you know patient advocacy and

1878
01:14:55,029 --> 01:15:00,039
working with you know medical farmers

1879
01:14:57,069 --> 01:15:02,408
and old heritage farmers that's where my

1880
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:05,109
heart is right but at the same time you

1881
01:15:02,408 --> 01:15:07,210
know I'm a you know former tech business

1882
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:09,399
strategist so I see the brilliance in

1883
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:11,170
the licensing as well and it's really

1884
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:13,299
torn because I want these heritage

1885
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:15,699
farmers whose lunch is being eaten by

1886
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:18,190
all the new Green Rush folks I would

1887
01:15:15,698 --> 01:15:21,189
like them to get paid for for the work

1888
01:15:18,189 --> 01:15:22,899
that they've done on on cannabis over

1889
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:25,448
all these years you know during

1890
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:27,698
Prohibition and in the you know with the

1891
01:15:25,448 --> 01:15:30,098
threat of you know going to jail these

1892
01:15:27,698 --> 01:15:31,909
people deserve something for all you

1893
01:15:30,099 --> 01:15:33,319
know for keeping the flame alive

1894
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:37,519
right and doing this important research

1895
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:40,189
but unfortunately you know it I can't

1896
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,110
want patents for them but but not want

1897
01:15:40,189 --> 01:15:44,359
patents for other people it's a it's a

1898
01:15:42,109 --> 01:15:46,519
way by picture than that and that's that

1899
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:49,429
gets confusing and so when people jump

1900
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:51,080
up squarely on one side it usually makes

1901
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:53,360
me a little suspicious you know just

1902
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:55,789
like you're in Mowgli's discussion right

1903
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,109
you know like like like the fact that

1904
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:58,789
you guys realize that you were

1905
01:15:57,109 --> 01:16:00,979
approaching the question from two

1906
01:15:58,789 --> 01:16:03,439
radically different sides and yet you

1907
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:05,869
agreed I think that there's a lot more

1908
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:07,639
of that in the industry than individual

1909
01:16:05,869 --> 01:16:09,680
people realize because there's few

1910
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,770
people who have done the homework to

1911
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:15,470
understand why some of the things they

1912
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:18,590
don't want are necessary but it's still

1913
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:20,090
fattening still hard to choke down ya

1914
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:22,220
know no doubt about it right because

1915
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:24,590
it's the nature of our industry right we

1916
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:27,260
we've always been this very communal

1917
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:29,270
share or open source kind of thing right

1918
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:31,159
puff up and pass right you know but you

1919
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:33,080
got to do the Hat you got to do the pass

1920
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:38,930
at the end and patents doesn't it's like

1921
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:42,229
papa keep well yes except if we choose

1922
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:49,730
to write so we can do the PUF PUF patent

1923
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:50,989
and then say okay I now let so I pass is

1924
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:55,909
that really what we're gonna say puff

1925
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:58,909
puff pass puff puff patent pass to those

1926
01:16:55,909 --> 01:17:00,590
people we wanted to use right so so but

1927
01:16:58,909 --> 01:17:01,550
and and this gets into also to other

1928
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:03,920
stuff I don't want to make this a

1929
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:06,980
notable property you know discussion

1930
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:09,350
right but so you can choose to assign

1931
01:17:06,979 --> 01:17:11,089
the rights to use that pad anybody you

1932
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:12,350
want once you have a patent right don't

1933
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:14,300
have to charge them for it you can let

1934
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:16,400
them use it for free all right we can do

1935
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:18,289
that right the problem with that is is

1936
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,089
that you by doing that by letting some

1937
01:17:18,289 --> 01:17:23,000
people have it for cheaper for free you

1938
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:24,890
set the value of the patent low so that

1939
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,779
when you turn around in monsanto comes

1940
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:28,039
knocking on your door you can't charge

1941
01:17:26,779 --> 01:17:29,750
them a million dollars for something you

1942
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:31,729
gave somebody else for free that's not

1943
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:36,949
that doesn't work in the pet and the pen

1944
01:17:31,729 --> 01:17:40,189
domain that way right so so you know so

1945
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:42,139
you know it is you know but if you

1946
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:45,710
choose to just give it away for free and

1947
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:47,750
not charge anybody for it then you can

1948
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,859
keep it away for free and not give it

1949
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,270
away to the people that you choose not

1950
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:53,449
to give it to it's your patent you can

1951
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:55,940
do anything you want with it so changing

1952
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:58,069
gears one more time before before we

1953
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:59,869
wrap up you know a lot of people are

1954
01:17:58,069 --> 01:18:02,599
saying like don't worry about all the

1955
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:05,000
cannabis patents because once they

1956
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:08,450
finally become enforceable with D

1957
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,430
scheduling they will be challenged in

1958
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:12,769
court and there's just no way that

1959
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:19,460
they'll stand up in court what do you

1960
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:20,690
think well so in my analysis I felt that

1961
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:23,180
there were some weaknesses in the patent

1962
01:18:20,689 --> 01:18:25,909
I felt that one of the things was is

1963
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:27,110
that there wasn't enough attention paid

1964
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:29,988
to the fact that these things were all

1965
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:32,599
f1 and therefore they're there they're

1966
01:18:29,988 --> 01:18:33,949
not stable and the seeds that were

1967
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,150
deposited and ironically they're

1968
01:18:33,949 --> 01:18:36,649
deposited outside the United States

1969
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:37,909
which means you can't bring them back in

1970
01:18:36,649 --> 01:18:40,309
the United States to test them at all

1971
01:18:37,909 --> 01:18:46,760
because it's illegal but that's another

1972
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:56,330
point so you the issue becomes then you

1973
01:18:46,760 --> 01:19:02,989
know in in the potential I lost my train

1974
01:18:56,329 --> 01:19:05,269
of thought here so I was asking you how

1975
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:06,829
likely was that would stand up in court

1976
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:09,680
oh and you said you said well there's a

1977
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:14,869
bunch of holes and right right so so

1978
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:18,050
some of the holes are you know that you

1979
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:19,579
have well this is the kind of time I'm

1980
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:22,010
going to be talking about is this this

1981
01:19:19,579 --> 01:19:25,550
Friday with AI PLA is you know you have

1982
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:27,500
a the fact that a particular set of

1983
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:29,539
genetics grown different ways will give

1984
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:32,689
you multiple outcomes right so in a

1985
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:35,050
situation in a situation like that okay

1986
01:19:32,689 --> 01:19:40,519
you have to ask the question well then

1987
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:43,460
you know what what defines the output

1988
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:48,380
right because none you know they're

1989
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:50,329
claiming you know THC and CBD hybrid

1990
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:52,819
well okay so what's the limitation

1991
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:55,909
behind that you know where do you draw

1992
01:19:52,819 --> 01:19:58,590
the line behind something that was part

1993
01:19:55,909 --> 01:20:01,439
of the genetics in the minute was not so

1994
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:03,539
in this patent they took some germ plasm

1995
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:04,889
a lot of different germ plasm they have

1996
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:06,989
a whole breeding table of all the things

1997
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:08,220
they did that would and they did it that

1998
01:20:06,989 --> 01:20:12,389
which they could peel off a lot of

1999
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:17,159
patents but in every situation right

2000
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:21,360
they tried to claim in f1 right and the

2001
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:24,329
issue the f1 then is hetero zygosity the

2002
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,859
patent examiner actually made a comment

2003
01:20:24,329 --> 01:20:26,909
about it in the prosecution of one of

2004
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:28,529
the patents and then there was an

2005
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:31,409
examiner interview and it went away and

2006
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:33,389
I'd say that that's probably one of the

2007
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:36,809
the places where I would hammer the

2008
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:39,720
hardest is like you know so why is

2009
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:41,610
something that we have a seed deposit

2010
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:43,079
for and I can take those seeds and I can

2011
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:46,979
show you that when I germinate the seeds

2012
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:48,779
that are undeposited you'll get 40 20 40

2013
01:20:46,979 --> 01:20:51,029
you know however many phenotypes so

2014
01:20:48,779 --> 01:20:52,979
which one of those phenotypes is the

2015
01:20:51,029 --> 01:20:54,689
correct phenotype for this claim all

2016
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:56,279
right that's how I would go about it so

2017
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:58,579
I do think that there are weaknesses I

2018
01:20:56,279 --> 01:21:02,519
do think there's potential for challenge

2019
01:20:58,579 --> 01:21:04,710
I think it's gonna be a tough a tough

2020
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,300
row to hoe only because there's not a

2021
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:08,640
lot of prior art so what has to happen

2022
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:10,770
is somebody's gonna have to go through

2023
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,750
and look at all of the Hempfest

2024
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:15,120
and the emerald cups and the High Times

2025
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:17,130
cups and all the data that's ever been

2026
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:19,409
published like on Facebook in those

2027
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:21,750
places because there is no scientific

2028
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:23,609
data available there are no patents

2029
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:25,529
there are no publications where we can

2030
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:27,509
say look straight X has this chemical

2031
01:21:25,529 --> 01:21:29,279
profile right so the only way to

2032
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:30,600
challenge these things is to show that

2033
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:34,489
these things existed in the public

2034
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:36,690
domain right so find some of these old

2035
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:38,639
2012/2013 high x cups all these things

2036
01:21:36,689 --> 01:21:41,279
that have been published and then take

2037
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:44,190
that with that in hand say okay so now

2038
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:47,729
the genetics is not stable or the

2039
01:21:44,189 --> 01:21:50,219
genetics are not stable okay they they

2040
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:52,289
say they have seed deposit X but if we

2041
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:54,329
take C deposit X and we germinate them

2042
01:21:52,289 --> 01:21:56,850
look at all the different phenotypes so

2043
01:21:54,329 --> 01:21:59,340
that combination of things is probably

2044
01:21:56,850 --> 01:22:01,740
the best way to go after these two

2045
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,029
analogy these patents the problem with

2046
01:22:01,739 --> 01:22:04,949
that is is that you know you're talking

2047
01:22:03,029 --> 01:22:05,969
a fair amount of money to get the

2048
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:07,380
background data

2049
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:08,940
you gotta germinate the seeds you gotta

2050
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,319
do chemical analysis there's a whole

2051
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:12,399
bunch of stuff that will need to be led

2052
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:14,170
up to because there's no other

2053
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:16,689
to do it so this is going to be a long

2054
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:18,699
drawn-out expensive patent battle unless

2055
01:22:16,689 --> 01:22:20,500
it's done by an inter partes review or

2056
01:22:18,698 --> 01:22:23,529
an expert interview so that you could

2057
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:26,319
avoid a court battle so right on sounds

2058
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:29,380
like a lot of attorneys getting rich off

2059
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:32,679
this and a great area for up and comers

2060
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:34,690
to go into you know law and biotech side

2061
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:37,270
this sounds like it's going to be a very

2062
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:39,339
exciting playground for a while you know

2063
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:41,830
before I let you go Reggie you were

2064
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:44,380
telling me earlier about the the new

2065
01:22:41,829 --> 01:22:45,939
expansion to your lab there at steep

2066
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:47,890
hill why don't you tell me a little bit

2067
01:22:45,939 --> 01:22:49,509
about that before before I let you go

2068
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:53,310
because you sounded pretty damn excited

2069
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:56,890
about it yeah no I am said so so we have

2070
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:58,570
steep hills is I mean from the last time

2071
01:22:56,890 --> 01:23:01,510
we talked it's not even the same company

2072
01:22:58,569 --> 01:23:06,158
anymore dude so we have steeple global

2073
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:08,860
now which is a parrot kind of division

2074
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:10,299
that handles our expansion we were you

2075
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:14,229
know we have steep in the Israel we're

2076
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:16,420
going into Europe we are we're in Canada

2077
01:23:14,229 --> 01:23:18,339
we're you know we have negotiations go

2078
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:19,810
on in South America so so steep hill has

2079
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,340
become an international company so we

2080
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:23,320
have steeple global we have steeple

2081
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:25,449
ventures which is actually an incubator

2082
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:28,059
arm now where we actually take startup

2083
01:23:25,448 --> 01:23:30,039
cannabis you know tech companies bring

2084
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,390
them in a house help them with finances

2085
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:35,469
help you know move the science to

2086
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:38,230
validate we've actually split up steep

2087
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:40,810
hill labs into a production and R&amp;D

2088
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:43,599
company now right so now we actually

2089
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:45,340
have a strictly devoted production side

2090
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,929
then their job is to do nothing but to

2091
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:49,029
make sure the trains run on time tests

2092
01:23:46,929 --> 01:23:51,310
get out in the timely fashion reports

2093
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:53,738
are accurate back on the stuff and and

2094
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:55,480
in the generation of all this stuff I

2095
01:23:53,738 --> 01:23:58,569
was able to kind of carve out steep hill

2096
01:23:55,479 --> 01:24:00,968
R&amp;D my little area where we continued

2097
01:23:58,569 --> 01:24:02,408
the genetic research we still do the

2098
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:06,630
kind of collaborative research with

2099
01:24:02,408 --> 01:24:10,649
universities we we do some of the

2100
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:12,940
validation work and and you know

2101
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:14,139
incubator work that it goes into the

2102
01:24:12,939 --> 01:24:17,289
companies that we bring in from steeple

2103
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:18,909
ventures so but the the really amazing

2104
01:24:17,289 --> 01:24:20,140
thing is is that all the stuff that you

2105
01:24:18,908 --> 01:24:22,408
and I have talked about over the years

2106
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:24,909
was it has been done with basically me

2107
01:24:22,408 --> 01:24:26,259
Anthony Christian and one point we had

2108
01:24:24,908 --> 01:24:29,649
Bob as well Bob

2109
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:31,840
who's as my laboratory director for

2110
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:33,848
genetics but who took a leave of absence

2111
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,010
about two years ago because he of some

2112
01:24:33,849 --> 01:24:38,099
family issues and and unfortunately the

2113
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:40,300
family issues just keep getting worse so

2114
01:24:38,099 --> 01:24:41,860
so you know so all of the work that

2115
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:43,150
steep hill is known for genetically has

2116
01:24:41,859 --> 01:24:46,058
been done on the back of like three

2117
01:24:43,149 --> 01:24:49,629
people really right so but the cool

2118
01:24:46,059 --> 01:24:52,329
thing is that now steep hill R&amp;D has its

2119
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:55,059
own staff so I have my main researchers

2120
01:24:52,328 --> 01:24:57,819
I've got a full-time bioinformatics

2121
01:24:55,059 --> 01:24:59,440
personnel guy now Keith Allen who came

2122
01:24:57,819 --> 01:25:00,518
to me from Syngenta so we've actually

2123
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:02,198
been doing some corporate raiding

2124
01:25:00,519 --> 01:25:05,110
ourselves and bringing in some really

2125
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:07,899
powerful people to help really blow up

2126
01:25:05,109 --> 01:25:09,908
our R&amp;D and our bioinformatics and

2127
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:11,408
genetics capability the last thing is

2128
01:25:09,908 --> 01:25:13,598
that we actually have our own genomic

2129
01:25:11,408 --> 01:25:17,710
services division that started up and

2130
01:25:13,599 --> 01:25:20,380
it's being headed by Daniela Vergara who

2131
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:21,550
is actually the head postdoc and the the

2132
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,349
post like in charge of the cannabis

2133
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:25,869
research at University of Colorado

2134
01:25:23,349 --> 01:25:27,670
Boulder and Nolan Cain's lab right so

2135
01:25:25,868 --> 01:25:29,979
we've cemented that that that

2136
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:33,010
partnership even further by hiring her

2137
01:25:29,979 --> 01:25:35,768
as our director of genomic services so

2138
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:37,659
steep hill has doubled down on the

2139
01:25:35,769 --> 01:25:39,159
genetic side and and it's just it's

2140
01:25:37,658 --> 01:25:41,859
really exciting the stuff that's coming

2141
01:25:39,158 --> 01:25:44,138
out of on a daily basis from my R&amp;D team

2142
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:48,988
is it I mean literally do you know if I

2143
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:51,940
could if I could you know use a an

2144
01:25:48,988 --> 01:25:54,368
inappropriate reference it's like being

2145
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:57,788
a porn addict and and having unlimited

2146
01:25:54,368 --> 01:26:00,308
access so essentially the invention of

2147
01:25:57,788 --> 01:26:02,139
the internet you know I I was at a lunch

2148
01:26:00,309 --> 01:26:04,659
the other day and somebody said oh yes

2149
01:26:02,139 --> 01:26:07,538
steep hill they've put together you know

2150
01:26:04,658 --> 01:26:10,988
a world-class terpene lab like like one

2151
01:26:07,538 --> 01:26:13,118
of the best in the world you must be

2152
01:26:10,988 --> 01:26:15,129
feeling pretty proud to have been able

2153
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:16,389
to finally put together all the pieces

2154
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:20,038
that you've been trying to put together

2155
01:26:16,389 --> 01:26:23,519
for a few years now absolutely and and

2156
01:26:20,038 --> 01:26:26,889
let me tell you so once we plugged in

2157
01:26:23,519 --> 01:26:29,320
the data just started rolling right now

2158
01:26:26,889 --> 01:26:32,230
I cannot tell you so

2159
01:26:29,319 --> 01:26:33,518
so before you you know you I was proud

2160
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:35,618
to say oh yeah we have another couple

2161
01:26:33,519 --> 01:26:38,440
genes and development for our you know

2162
01:26:35,618 --> 01:26:40,149
for our library of genetic services and

2163
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:42,639
and and now it's like

2164
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:44,649
we have we have to develop how many at

2165
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:46,570
the same time I have like a list of 40

2166
01:26:44,649 --> 01:26:48,488
genes that were developing all at the

2167
01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:49,689
same time now because that's how fast

2168
01:26:48,488 --> 01:26:51,789
you're coming out of the biome France

2169
01:26:49,689 --> 01:26:53,529
pipeline right now so oh my god well

2170
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:57,850
right on well congratulations on all you

2171

01:27:06,819 --> 01:27:10,599
really tells this story like you do

2178
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:13,570
you've got the science and the law

2179
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:15,579
background but also the swagger to tell

2180
