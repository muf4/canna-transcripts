1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,039
to say that normally you saved the best

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,320
presentations for last but I've seen the

3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,969
Reggie speak before I haven't seen the

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,070
lesion yes but again I got to see your

5
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:23,140
slide and I'm telling you this is a

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,060
treat this might be the best session so

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,539
I don't know if we could do much better

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:31,059
after this but it's going to be fun I

9
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:33,640
can tell you that there's animations and

10
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:36,100
all kinds of things in this and this

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,130
kicks off the connect cannabis genomics

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,929
testing session and

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:44,080
Alicia Holloway is the director of

14
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:46,090
bioinformatics with BIOS bioscience and

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,759
she's going to talk to us today about

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:52,590
bringing molecular medicine and genomic

17
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,589
tools to candidates

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,548
[Applause]

19
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:43,150
thank you for inviting me here and also

20
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,969
for providing early coffee thank you for

21
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,440
to all of you for listening to me talk

22
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,179
about the work that I'm doing I

23
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,759
sometimes wake up in the morning and I'm

24
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,740
surprised that I can apply the science

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,790
that I've been trained to do to this

26
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,789
amazing field

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,890
bioscience and

28
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,710
high technology cannabis genomics

29
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:11,340
company we're using new science tell

30
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:14,709
Brewers save money save time and gravity

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,050
you all know that cannabis has a long

32
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:19,209
history with humans we've carried it to

33
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,010
all corners of the earth and we continue

34
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:26,469
to do so and it's clear why we do that

35
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:29,069
this plant is possibly the most useful

36
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:29,069
planet

37
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,469
alliteration

38
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:41,139
but we've only begun to unlock its

39
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:43,719
potential it has huge medical

40
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:47,708
possibilities and in fact even as a

41
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:49,449
secondary side effect of using it as a

42
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,560
medicine and we're seeing drops in

43
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:55,988
opioid uses this is as you know

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,949
potentially a 25 billion dollar industry

45
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:02,379
over the next few years and even with

46
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:05,469
the severe restrictions and legal

47
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:09,169
limitations that we have been going

48
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:11,609
through we've done some amazing planet

49
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:14,250
you've probably heard of the iron love

50
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,069
prohibition when alcohol was made

51
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:21,598
illegal it went underground it became

52
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:23,969
very potent even deadly but that we were

53
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,628
not in that that scenario with cannabis

54
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:29,580
but the potency of cannabis in basement

55
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:32,000
reading operations has gone from eight

56
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,000
to even thirty percent

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,310
by the dry weight my flower

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,810
during the times that

59
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,810
that provision has been an effective

60
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:50,969
basic reading has also produced small

61
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:53,959
plants that may not grow well indoors so

62
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:56,489
there are a lot of things that that

63
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,189
have happened to this plant during this

64
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,950
basement breeding period but it's also

65
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,439
given us

66
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:08,159
amazing varieties for cultivars that

67
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:11,780
have flavours and chemo type profiles

68
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,909
but you know you can present imagine

69
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,100
but now the cannabis is legal in many

70
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,560
states in a few countries we can really

71
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,660
ask the ultimate question what can we do

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,509
with this plant when we bring modern

73
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,880
genomics schools together with the

74
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:30,050
decades of knowledge that growers and

75
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,050
breeders already have

76
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:35,579
first we can and we really have to

77
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:38,639
answer some very three basic research

78
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:42,529
questions answers to two basic questions

79
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,139
will help growers breeders and consumers

80
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:48,000
growers and learn

81
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:51,170
what they have

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
ezal or something else

83
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,610
growers can begin to market their

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,129
products in particular ways we learn

85
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,430
about the genetic relationships between

86
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:04,649
cultivars they determine whether their

87
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,500
part is meat or if they want to market

88
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:10,429
it more like they do for wine varieties

89
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,949
where you have the terroir approach

90
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:16,040
growers can learn what their coffers are

91
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:19,800
as a good related you

92
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,500
consumers with some of the developments

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,629
that we're making can say I like Carlos

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,220
Clinton how can I get that again how can

95
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,829
I make sure that I'm getting the same

96
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,410
thing over and over

97
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:33,810
and readers from the genomic tools that

98
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,570
we're developing and studying genetic

99
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,550
creation' they can begin to learn what

100
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,889
variation exists with the cool parts

101
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,660
that we have today

102
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:45,229
and this is the raw material for

103
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,710
solution so then we can start to apply

104
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,710
the variation

105
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:57,479
we can learn how to select for pest

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,149
resistance and a robust stature for

107
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,200
growing as different conditions that are

108
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:06,799
outside or in large greenhouses

109
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,779
so we partnered with a few key academic

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,819
labs as answer some of these questions

111
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,819
about the biology and genetic

112
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,220
and we're taking three basic approaches

113
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:23,029
where you're characterizing the genetic

114
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,440
variation within cultivars and

115
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:26,629
to learn what kind of variation you have

116
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,860
to work with

117
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,649
we're learning how the different

118
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,350
cultivars are related to each other for

119
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:37,560
example do all the cultivars that have a

120
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,980
high CBD cluster together are they all

121
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,069
related or do we see that phenotype in a

122
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:47,610
whole plate

123
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:49,529
and how and also we learn how drink

124
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,889
cultivars have drawn from natural

125
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:54,089
populations around the world

126
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,449
so we want to integrate all of this

127
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,449
information

128
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,160
we want to map the information that

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,810
determines whether there's variations

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,770
for as I mentioned before pest

131
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:10,470
resistance or maybe drought tolerance so

132
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:13,949
that readers can use plants that are

133
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:17,930
strong Hardy and also have even new

134
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:20,519
unique flavor profiles

135
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:23,850
so to do all the things that we want to

136
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,269
do we need to do we need a solid genome

137
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,970
assembly

138
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:32,129
we need that state what genes are there

139
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,860
where they are you can learn about

140
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,538
different pathways the pathways that

141
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,629
produce different cannabinoids or

142
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:42,379
terpenes and we can compare those to

143
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,379
model clear

144
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:47,810
and we can begin to develop linkage

145
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:52,718
now there are existing gene are there is

146
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,509
at least one

147
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:59,360
and pilots has decided to stick with

148
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:04,120
another genome and why would we do that

149
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,560
well we learned a lot from comparing the

150
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,978
parts to each other whole genome

151
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,089
sequence we can learn about

152
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:16,389
variations large-scale

153
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:19,218
you can also learn about smaller scale

154
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:21,968
duplication and deletion of genes from

155
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:25,848
one to many

156
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:29,439
one good example of this is copy number

157
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:33,860
isn't tha someday th-th

158
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,589
DVD we know that different copy numbers

159
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,168
of those are

160
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:41,589
reflected in cultivars that produce high

161
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:43,208
levels of CBD versus

162
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,620
T

163
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:48,669
so we can learn about these pathways by

164
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,370
sequencing and understandable genome

165
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:53,860
so what are we trying to work with here

166
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,350
cannabis

167
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,449
plant genomes very inside the figure

168
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,879
shows doesn't matter what the numbers

169
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:04,578
are so much but it shows that plants

170
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,028
blowing things in particular but huge

171
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:11,179
diversity of genome sizes

172
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:14,328
so just as a marker here humans kind of

173
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:17,208
like mid-range rabid offices the model

174
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:19,979
expands is on the smaller side human

175
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,899
genome is about twenty times larger than

176
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,060
and

177
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,519
cannabis and something like tomato are

178
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,318
sort of in between them the human genome

179
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,209
is about four times larger than the

180
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,250
cannabis you know so actually we're

181
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:34,409
we're kind of lucky some of these jams

182
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,049
that are really large implants have lots

183
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:40,399
of repetitive elements and parts of

184
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:43,740
their grades of understand the muscle

185
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,549
also candidates have a tantrum of them

186
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,318
and one of the interesting things about

187
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:51,559
the biology of cannabis is that it has

188
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:53,838
an X Y chromosome will determines our

189
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:56,909
determination

190
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,490
and this makes reveals different in the

191
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:01,490
way that you might breathe for this

192
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,490
plant

193
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,018
so here's a

194
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:17,688
slide about

195
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,688
the page lab has done a phenomenal job

196
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:26,889
resequencing project they've used what's

197
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:29,379
called short green sequencing

198
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:33,039
by four so these are short segments of

199
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:37,028
DNA a big sequence very very deeply into

200
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,969
the genome and have have produced a

201
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:43,509
great draft genome and are continuing to

202
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,678
improve it all the time we felt like we

203
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,649
wanted to take a different approach

204
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:49,058
though he's still one of you compare

205
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,369
their genomes to each other but we used

206
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:54,129
a different sequencing approach we used

207
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:57,989
Pacific Biosciences technology which

208
00:10:54,129 --> 00:11:00,959
produces these really long threes and

209
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:04,959
the advantage of that is that you can

210
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,969
much easier assemble the genome so you

211
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,068
take these these long reads of

212
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,350
nucleotides and you go together and if

213
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:14,019
the sequences are longer it's very easy

214
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,449
to know where they belong with respect

215
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:19,509
to each other so with less depth of

216
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:23,818
sequencing we can get more of the genome

217
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:27,089
assemble now we're still working on this

218
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:29,498
we want to have greater depth of

219
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:32,910
sequencing and we want to try to cover

220
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:36,418
as much of the genome as we can

221
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:39,159
so this is still a work in progress

222
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:42,639
but even though we have just a draft

223
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:45,730
genome we can start to compare cultivars

224
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,879
on a large scale we care enough do these

225
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,928
things that I mentioned previously and

226
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,428
to do that you've sampled

227
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:59,578
cannabis cultivars from all over the

228
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:59,578
world we have covered over 40 country

229
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:05,250
and for most of the sequencing that

230
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,259
we're doing we're focusing on a smaller

231
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:12,708
subset of around 3,000 stems or genetic

232
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,708
variants

233
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,450
so what do we found one way to

234
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,220
characterize genetic variation is to ask

235
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,019
how many sites in the genome are

236
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,220
variable so remember this is the raw

237
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,169
material that we're going to be

238
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,100
selecting for two cool different traits

239
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:32,149
out of the plant and so I just put a few

240
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:37,220
other species up here as comparison

241
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,220
humans you might say and have a dish

242
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:49,850
is similar

243
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:53,070
delicious already

244
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,810
grape has a fair amount genetic

245
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,870
variation and in the grape industry

246
00:12:54,809 --> 00:13:00,750
there's a lot of concern over pathogens

247
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:03,950
that are taking out some long-lived

248
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,950
cultivars that are really

249
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,009
it does have a lot of

250
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,529
varieties as well as

251
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:21,580
within one in red liners there's

252
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:24,570
relatively no genetic great together you

253
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,570
get a screen

254
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:37,169
they look identical if you take to

255
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:37,170
campus both bars you get a variety

256
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,110
statures

257
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,980
yield and

258
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:55,900
this is actually kind of cool because

259
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,370
basement breeders have been allowed to

260
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:02,110
using those kind of

261
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,690
cracking these games it'll cross as you

262
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:09,629
know pick phenotypes the big life and

263
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:13,030
then clone them and make lots of

264
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:15,220
so now that we could use modern

265
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:17,139
molecular breeding techniques we can

266
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,009
take much better advantage of the

267
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:23,889
variation that already exists in the

268
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:27,100
plant we can start to snap traits more

269
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:30,299
effectively and so we can have a robust

270
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:34,290
plant that's resistant to pests

271
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:36,029
smells like a dream and reduces anxiety

272
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:39,759
[Music]

273
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:42,490
so that's a little bit about the genetic

274
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,879
variation within cannabis we have a lot

275
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,220
overall population but we also have a

276
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,990
lot with the end of each cultivar

277
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,330
there's a lot of genetic variation and

278
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,240
so we wanted to understand how those

279
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,400
translates into

280
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,000
population structure

281
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,819
our modern relic cultivars

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
one distinct group of candidates without

283
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:11,620
the world power that related to him and

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,230
other land races and so we've used an

285
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,720
approach that looks that population

286
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,529
origin our ancestry a programmable

287
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,649
structure and this is a model based

288
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:26,409
clustering method that uses data to

289
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:29,470
infer this population structure and

290
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:32,649
assign each individual that we sample to

291
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,379
different populations so here's an

292
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:38,350
example for

293
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:40,439
humans each color on here represents a

294
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,240
population and

295
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,480
there are seven colors to represent the

296
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,460
seven population supported populations

297
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,909
of humans

298
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:56,259
each vertical line on this figure is one

299
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:59,559
cubic so if you have a bar that's got

300
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:02,620
some orange some red and a little bit of

301
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,859
blue it means that your heritage comes

302
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,789
from three different populations this is

303
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,789
similar to what you might see

304
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:17,920
so we applied this to Canada and we

305
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,929
actually have support for seven

306
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,500
populations in cannabis that are

307
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:25,710
represented by these seven colors

308
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:30,279
I mean anything from

309
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:33,279
welcome both of our names or inna types

310
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:36,480
where we're just starting to get a sense

311
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:39,759
of really how these populations are

312
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,950
but what cultivars compose these

313
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:47,289
populations so the one on the left is og

314
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:51,730
cush it's not members that includes

315
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,730
white fire emoji

316
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:56,529
Evan

317
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,440
if you look there are

318
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:03,470
thousands of samples there are a lot

319
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,950
and that those often will have a large

320
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,950
component

321
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:10,150
but they're also a mixture of

322
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:35,980
ezel Hamsun street from og cush

323
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:44,480
there is the high CBD group this is one

324
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,339
of a couple of areas where we see high

325
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,870
CBD this includes ken atomic ac/dc

326
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,879
riveting

327
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:57,139
we have these similar coming very which

328
00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:00,710
is very white like very high my study

329
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,270
and then the purples where we have

330
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:08,360
purple kush purple Urkel

331
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:10,579
yeah and any purple we also Stancil a

332
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:13,219
huge number of

333
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:16,710
returning land races these are not

334
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,808
cultivated in a traditional way like the

335
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,019
drug cultivars that there's they're from

336
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:23,970
throughout the world and

337
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:27,900
we have a really good representation

338
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,880
from Africa and these African II called

339
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,240
the virus Paul makes this land race

340
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,550
group we also have a lot from South

341
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,269
America and Southeast Asia that also

342
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,269
comprise

343
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,569
the final group and I think this is not

344
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:47,480
surprising based on other research is

345
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:49,950
that things that are

346
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,589
traditionally known as pets really do

347
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,049
fall out into a separate population

348
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:58,849
group we have representatives from

349
00:19:55,049 --> 00:20:02,299
Russia Greece Brazil Kazakhstan Morocco

350
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:05,329
and so they fall out somewhat separately

351
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:09,069
one thing that I thought was interesting

352
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:13,148
is that cultivars like part liquidity

353
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:16,700
practical has a pretty good amount of

354
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:19,668
heritage from that have about 20% of

355
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,399
their genome is similar to these these

356
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:23,690
have variety

357
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:26,139
so this is told us a little bit about

358
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:29,759
how

359
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:32,670
cannabis both of ours are structured

360
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:36,629
but we wanted to represent this

361
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:39,150
in a way that

362
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,770
really compares

363
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,400
all of the sample colder words to each

364
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:48,329
other so we developed this 3d

365
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:53,050
representation of the

366
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:56,460
of our data that is what we're calling

367
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:59,849
the silence galaxy

368
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:05,079
so this is based on

369
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:08,879
each of the dots that you see or note in

370
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:12,759
this image or this movie is one sample

371
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,100
and they're colored by those results

372
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:17,559
from the structure analysis so if you

373
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:21,009
remember the chemists are green they'll

374
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:23,500
be green announced and then the lines

375
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:25,509
that connect two notes together are

376
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,539
again another analysis that tries to

377
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:30,640
infer relationships between cultivars so

378
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:34,059
which ones are parent-child

379
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,600
relationships or funnel relationships we

380
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:41,279
do have a significant number of samples

381
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,279
that appear to be genetically identical

382
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:52,679
here's another image that shows you that

383
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:54,569
come group a little more clearly I wish

384
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,509
I had seemed in a little bit more of it

385
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:59,700
there's finola the Kazakhstan samples

386
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:03,889
and other things that when people

387
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,889
submitted them to us they made terms

388
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:15,319
this shows the og og cush population you

389
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:17,599
saw at first there were a lot of lines

390
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:20,058
between them there are a lot of

391
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,189
first-degree relationships within this

392
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:24,589
cluster

393
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:27,110
they aren't necessarily close with each

394
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:29,319
other there are some of those but there

395
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:29,319
are

396
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,420
this is interesting so I want to talk

397
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:46,428
about the names of cultivars everyone

398
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,070
wants to know do I have the real girls

399
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,850
yeah I got that question we're pretty

400
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:57,129
far from actually having a handle on

401
00:22:51,849 --> 00:23:00,500
but some tight clusters of clones

402
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,830
have very consistent names blue dream

403
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,480
which comprises I think 10% of the

404
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:07,939
market in Washington last year some

405
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,819
large percentage of the market actually

406
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,230
does seem to form a nice tight cluster

407
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:15,019
in our negative thoughts so if you're

408
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,029
kidding Blue Dream at a dispensary it's

409
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,069
very possible to actually what you think

410
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:22,178
it is now you'll notice there are a few

411
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:27,039
other names scattered in here

412
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:30,150
but it's likely that there was a dream

413
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,149
[Music]

414
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,100
we also have the converse of the four

415
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:39,029
you have one name and it's just

416
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:39,029
scattered

417
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:46,329
this is a just a final example that I

418
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,549
wanted to show you so I mentioned the

419
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:50,980
purple group

420
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:54,308
and all of these things you see here

421
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:56,700
there was peevish purple are clones of

422
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,700
each other

423
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:03,160
but you can see hopefully you can beat

424
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:06,129
the names a little bit there is every

425
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,440
name in the book in this cluster there's

426
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:11,230
brand article which is probably familiar

427
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,500
with in there's lavender and let's

428
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:18,009
finish a box GDP of almost no name is

429
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,679
repeated twice so clearly we have a long

430
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:24,519
way to go to clarify blood cultivar name

431
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:27,759
it actually means and in fact I can't

432
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:30,730
even say that there are 39 thousand

433
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:33,450
named cultivars that are sold in

434
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,450
Washington West

435
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,480
to health growers and breeders

436
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:45,730
and consumers we're developing the virus

437
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,880
giatec test which you can purchase and

438
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:52,860
send in a little piece of system to us

439
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:56,830
and we can sorry miss galaxy

440
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:58,659
so we be making a mess fair amount of

441
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,579
progress we're characterizing the

442
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,640
genetic variation within the cultivars

443
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:06,549
that we've looked at we're inferring

444
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,970
family relationships how the different

445
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:12,629
people of course yes

446
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:16,440
it's where they are and

447
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:19,060
now we're starting to work towards

448
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,019
developing modern genetic tools for

449
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:25,359
readers with the finalist use head test

450
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,579
that's a first step but we have a long

451
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,279
way to go

452
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:31,980
there's really I think and we think a

453
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,210
greeting revolution

454
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:38,259
cannabis legalization is taking place

455
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:40,090
all over the US and the world and it's

456
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:42,190
really a parallel with the Scientific

457
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:44,139
Revolution that's transforming

458
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,620
agriculture towards the Jews cannabis

459
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:50,820
every native plant people are using

460
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:54,429
genomic sequence data to breathe

461
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:58,299
for all major agricultural crops and

462
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:59,580
they're using the genomic data to make

463
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:03,079
new plant varieties

464
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:05,359
faster and more on

465
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,609
so we want this to be a part of the

466
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,408
cannabis industry we're turning the

467
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:12,558
schools that we're developing into tests

468
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:14,980
so that we can help other breeders with

469
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:17,210
their programs

470
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,460
readers can learn about the genetic

471
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:22,100
variation in their lines you know about

472
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,730
the relationships between them we're

473
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:28,158
going to be developing

474
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:32,079
marker-assisted selection methods and

475
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,080
using genomic selection and

476
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:37,099
our goal really is to help readers bring

477
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:39,888
you iterations of the classics that

478
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:40,898
they've produced to market so by the end

479
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:43,548
of the decade

480
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:45,768
breeders will begin releasing new

481
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:46,898
cannabis varieties that we haven't even

482
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:49,308
dreamed of

483
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:51,729
they're entirely unlike the ones that we

484
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,730
have today

485
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,788
everything on I thank you all for

486
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:58,308
listening and thank my team members at

487
00:26:55,788 --> 00:27:00,099
ILO's we are a small start-up so

488
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:03,289
everyone

489
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:03,289
