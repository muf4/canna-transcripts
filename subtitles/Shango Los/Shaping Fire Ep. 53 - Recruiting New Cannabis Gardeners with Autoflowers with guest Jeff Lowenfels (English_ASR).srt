2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,699
it was the summer of 2017 when I first

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,559
experienced autoflowering cannabis I was

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,079
standing in the fields with Seth and

5
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,809
Eric Crawford of Oregon's CBD seeds

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,448
looking at gorgeous and fabulously

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,239
smelling acres and acres of cannabis

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,868
that was ready to harvest in the

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:30,028
beginning of September my regular plants

10
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,640
at home had another six weeks left to

11
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:35,100
flower six weeks that would leave me in

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,049
the face of October rains but these

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,969
fields in front of me were finished and

14
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,099
ready to be cut and dried

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,219
that is when I first understood the

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,620
potential for OTO flowers then in the

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,649
summer of 2018 I grew my first OTO

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,968
flower seeds and spent the entire run

19
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,679
realizing the major impact that these

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,870
seeds were gonna have on home growing

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,090
and the industry as a whole over the

22
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,429
next 10 years

23
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,070
finally solid cultivars of OTO flowers

24
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,170
were available and I knew that home

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,478
growers patients and some commercial

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,939
growers were going to be astonished when

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,129
they had a chance to trial them by

28
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,889
September my OTO flowers were out of the

29
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,798
ground dried and in jars well ahead of

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,450
the rains my regular photo period seeds

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,689
were in the greenhouse still and

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,159
preparing for the harsh October cold

33
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:25,079
then it emerald cup last year I found

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,180
myself standing with Jeff Lowen Fell's

35
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,158
chatting about how I thought autos were

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,799
gonna change the face of homegrown and

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,200
Jeff smiled and said that he agreed and

38
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,490
that in fact as a gardening columnist

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,159
for over 40 years

40
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:40,530
he saw Auto flowers as the new tomato

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
plant that these new auto flower

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,000
varieties were the threshold moment

43
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,389
where cannabis cultivation made the

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,478
cross over to regular folks and that

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,280
Jeff had written a book about them Jeff

46
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,259
and I each looked at each other like we

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,379
shared a secret that was going to excite

48
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,540
everybody I went home and programmed an

49
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:04,140
entire year of Auto flower content for

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,840

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,610

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,039

53
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,930
patients standing room only presentation

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,419

56
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,068

57
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,789

absolutely fantastic here we've been

102
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,159
getting a lot of rain here which

103
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,659
concerns everybody who's growing in the

104
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,478
Pacific Northwest but we've gotten three

105
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:03,030
days of Sun so everybody's sitting in a

106
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,519
little bit of false hope yeah well

107
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,870
hopefully hopefully it'll come true yeah

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,669
totally is that actually that will play

109
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,408
into today's topic really well so

110
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,229
congratulations on your new book out

111
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:15,780
today on Auto flowers I am so excited

112
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,840
it's such a such a departure from what I

113
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,579
normally do but it was it was just one

114
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,848
of those things I just felt I had to do

115
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,379
and so it's out today you can get it on

116
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:26,779
Amazon you should be able to get it at

117
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:30,129
bookstores

118
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:32,389
we'll see I don't know it's hard to say

119
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:34,159
what the distributions gonna be you

120
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,529
never know it's a cannabis book and of

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,400
course there's still that stigma you

122
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:42,019
know but but people people uh taking a

123
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,849
look at this tell me that maybe this

124
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:46,189
book's gonna help lift that stigma a

125
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,510
little bit so we hope so let's see well

126
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:49,939
as someone who's already had an

127
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,379
opportunity to read it I think it's

128
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,079
fantastic I think it not only will

129
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:56,719
increase or decrease the stigma but

130
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,389
increase the number of people dabbling

131
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,490
in cannabis which is which is really fun

132
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,289
right because up to this point you've

133
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,629
had to have a certain amount of hutzpah

134
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,189
to get into cannabis and to grow it

135
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:08,449
either because it was illegal and you're

136
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,240
gonna have to go through all this hiding

137
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:13,490
stuff or if it was illegal in your state

138
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,030
to grow a few plants you had to feel

139
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,610
especially confident in I don't know in

140
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:20,929
your right in your right to do that

141
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,270
right because even though something

142
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,000
might be legal to grow you still might

143
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:28,430
get shamed by your family or neighbors

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,430
or whatever and so I think your your

145
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,490
book helps create support for those

146
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,079
people who just want to grow plants

147
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,460
really and then and that's that's really

148
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,069
the genesis of the book you know you

149
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:42,859
know me I'm so-called Lord of the roots

150
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,478
I write books about soil and and you

151
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,120
know the science behind how things grow

152
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,728
organically and and all of a sudden

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,290
here's a book on autoflowering cannabis

154
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:57,110
maybe I ought to mention the name it's a

155
00:05:51,290 --> 00:06:00,830
DIY autoflowering cannabis a new way to

156
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,850
grow and so so why did I write this book

157
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:03,769
you know it was sort of one of these

158
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,689
crazy things that just doesn't seem to

159
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:07,728
be in character what people don't know

160
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:10,189
is that I also write a garden column and

161
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:12,918
I was invited to speak at the Garden

162
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:15,529
Writers of America oh gosh he must have

163
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:19,009
been six or seven years ago and and and

164
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:20,809
it was the first talk on cannabis that

165
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,959
this organization's had these are the

166
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,870
radio people the TV people and newspaper

167
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,819
and magazine people etcetera and so I

168
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,269
gave this talk about how I thought

169
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:34,848
cannabis was the next tomato and and the

170
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:37,969
talk was fine and people walked away

171
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:40,339
with a lot of excitement about CBD but

172
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,630
it didn't have the impact that I thought

173
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,879
I would

174
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:44,589
hoping it would have because I really I

175
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,300
really think that cannabis is a fun

176
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,069
plant to grow I know it is a fun plant

177
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,360
to grow anybody who's tried it knows

178
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:51,430
it's a fun plant to grow it can be a

179
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,020
little bit challenging but it's a great

180
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,269
plant to grow and if you're a gardener

181
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:57,789
and you like horticulture this is a

182
00:06:55,269 --> 00:07:00,159
terrific plant well you know one of the

183
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:03,010
reasons it didn't it it didn't take off

184
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,160
as a subject is because these plants are

185
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:09,310
hard to grow they require a tremendous

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,439
amount of space to start with and most

187
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,410
gardeners don't have a lot of space

188
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,360
they're in a condo they have a deck you

189
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,310
know they have a small vegetable garden

190
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,930
when you say when you say these plants

191
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,600
you mean traditional cannabis plants

192
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,709
right yes exactly exactly so that so

193
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,120
that's why one of the reasons why I

194
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,789
don't think garden writers took to this

195
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,759
the second reason is is that these

196
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,200
plants require a photo period in other

197
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,079
words as anybody who's growing these

198
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,699
plants know they have to have the

199
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,550
traditional plants they have to have

200
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:42,219
more than 12 hours of darkness before

201
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,129
they will begin to flower now that

202
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,290
causes very little problem in lots of

203
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:50,139
places but in many places particularly

204
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,700
Northern Hemisphere places and I guess

205
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,409
if you're on this south of the southern

206
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,409
hemisphere places

207
00:07:53,410 --> 00:08:00,370
you you know you don't get that period

208
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,990
of darkness until things begin to get

209
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,920
very cool so if you live in Anchorage

210
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,560
Alaska on September 21st when we have 12

211
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,410
hours of daylight and 12 hours of

212
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,870
darkness we also usually have a frost

213
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,150
well you know it takes another six or

214
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,949
seven weeks for that plant to flower and

215
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:20,409
those flowers that develop etcetera so

216
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,079
it's very hard to grow cannabis and I

217
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,210
and I became convinced that's why it

218
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:28,389
wasn't taking off in states where it was

219
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:32,319
legal low and behold my good friend Tom

220
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:37,449
Alexander the very same guy who told me

221
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:41,289
about the the fungus protecting a tomato

222
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:44,259
root from a nematode trying to attack it

223
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:46,870
which started my whole adventure into

224
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:49,080
the soil food web and began the whole

225
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,399
series of books and everything else

226
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,590
shows me some plants that he's going

227
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,149
called Otto flower plants now you know

228
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,800
we all know about all the flower plants

229
00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:00,459
we've heard about them before they were

230
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:04,329
discovered you know and bred and finally

231
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:07,030
in around 1970 or so people started to

232
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,980
release these little things called low

233
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:11,199
rider plants and they were cute little

234
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,659
things and they didn't have a photo

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,280
period like the big guys did and they

236
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:16,600
were tiny you could grow them in little

237
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,299
6-inch pots

238
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,040
whoa so that was sort of exciting but

239
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:26,079
the but the cannabis that they produce

240
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:28,839
was low in THC and very the plants were

241
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,350
small cute novelty you know a lot of fun

242
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,690
to show people but not not something

243
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,050
really that you would grow to harvest I

244
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,120
was fast forward to when Tom showed me

245
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:42,639
these Auto flowers about five or six

246
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,549
years ago they were decent sized tomato

247
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,620
sized plants and they were without

248
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:52,179
question producing cannabis that was

249
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,340
usable and I started to grow them and

250
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:57,339
fool around with them and lo and behold

251
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,500
every time you you grew one it was a

252
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,019
better plant because the breeding on

253
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,330
these things has has just multiplied

254
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:07,029
like crazy and because of interests in

255
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,879
the in getting a plant that is available

256
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:12,429
for everybody there's been a tremendous

257
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,490
amount of work put into producing seeds

258
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:18,299
that produce plants that meet all the

259
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:22,120
requirements you would want to have for

260
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:25,240
growing this plant as a hobby plant home

261
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,659
gardener not a cannabis producer but a

262
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,389
home gardener your aunt your uncle your

263
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:33,159
mother you know your brother and sister

264
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:35,169
who don't like cannabis but love to grow

265
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:38,559
tomatoes and cucumbers and zucchini

266
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:41,049
boom these are Oh flowers now are at

267
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,000
that point and so just because you know

268
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:45,099
I've got a lot of a lot of friends who I

269
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,860
think would really love it I I sat down

270
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,269
and wrote a book and it's not the same

271
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,909
kind of book as the teimi book it's very

272
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:54,669
easy it's very light if you are a

273
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:57,189
commercial grower this is not a book for

274
00:10:54,669 --> 00:11:00,579
you this is a book for Uncle Bob and

275
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:03,880
Aunt Sally at Christmastime so that they

276
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,650
can learn about cannabis and then learn

277
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,399
about autoflowering cannabis and the

278
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,139
opportunities that it presents

279
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,789
I can certainly imagine that this book

280
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,620
is gonna be under a lot of Christmas

281
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:14,419
trees this year and when you were

282
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,850
talking about Utah your your

283
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:19,549
presentation a few years back at the

284
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,980
Gardeners Association you said that you

285
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:25,189
know it wasn't immediately picked up and

286
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,779
embraced by the the writers and other

287
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,220
media people are there and you said

288
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:30,679
primarily you thought because of the

289
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,560
size of cannabis plants and of course it

290
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,839
was the the plant itself was still very

291
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,519
much in in legal prohibition transition

292
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,259
at that time but my question for you is

293
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,659
very specifically because you know that

294
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:45,590
your your your whole your book is all

295
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:48,980
about normalizing cannabis gardening

296
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:51,830
right and and as somebody who's been

297
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,509
writing a garden column for over 40

298
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,850
years and and you know you've won awards

299
00:11:53,509 --> 00:12:00,230
and you're very successful at that what

300
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:02,210
is it about gardening columnist which

301
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,899
causes them to have to kind of err on

302
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:07,430
the conservative side you know I don't

303
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:12,319
really I don't know the answer to it but

304
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:15,319
but I bet you do yeah I do it's fear and

305
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,850
it's fear of your publisher which is you

306
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,350
know pretty easy to overcome you just go

307
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,450
ask your publisher whether it's okay for

308
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:24,200
you to write about cannabis it's it's

309
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:27,740
fear of your readership turning their

310
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,830
back on you you know a lot of times that

311
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,810
when I think about my my core readership

312
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,730
I think you know is and I'm I really

313
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:37,099
shouldn't be saying this but I'm gonna

314
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,899
say you know me I think you know the

315
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,779
little old lady in tennis sneakers and

316
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,549
and she's somebody who once wants me to

317
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:46,009
be writing about cannabis or should I be

318
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:48,859
writing about Mary goals and you know

319
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:52,159
how to harvest your potatoes so so it's

320
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,759
fear and Corey and then of course

321
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,490
there's that there's that that

322
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,319
possibility you know that that that you

323
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,480
say something that somehow gets you in

324
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,970
trouble with the law you know either

325
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,610
it's illegal in your state or you you

326
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,649
make a suggestion you know somehow it

327
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,680
doesn't fit with a regulation so so for

328
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,720
example in Washington State it's against

329
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,899
I think it's still against law you tell

330
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,779
me - no maybe it's not there's no

331
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,909
there's no homegirl here ya know

332
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,439
that's what I was gonna say and in New

333
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:27,379
York State when they were trying to pass

334
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,390
you know Governor Cuomo got convinced by

335
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,139
boy I'm gonna get you know slammed it on

336
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:33,919
this one

337
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:36,949
you know by madmen to not let people

338
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,569
grow their own plants you know so you

339
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,660
know there's there's there's the stigma

340
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,990
about and I'm gonna say the word I hate

341
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:44,269
it

342
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,610
marijuana you know when you hear the

343
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:48,850
word marijuana you know you're talking

344
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:52,310
to somebody that has a stigma about

345
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,290
cannabis because it's a disgusting word

346
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:55,789
from my perspective it's a you know it's

347
00:13:54,289 --> 00:14:00,199
like putting a statue up to Harry

348
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:03,289
Anslinger who use that word to turn the

349
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,480
public against this drug and and this

350
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:08,779
medicine and this wonderful recreational

351
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,490
thing so yeah it's a big stigma there so

352
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:15,439
and I remember when I wrote my first

353
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:17,330
column on cannabis I always just tell

354
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,010
people you when you read my columns if

355
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,850
I'm writing about tomatoes you can apply

356
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:24,980
that you can apply that knowledge to

357
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,810
cannabis but but all of a sudden it was

358
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,060
fully legalized in Alaska and it's been

359
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:31,399
legal here since 1975 in the privacy of

360
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:34,009
your home but it became fully legalized

361
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,110
medical and recreational and I wrote a

362
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:38,179
column and I asked my readers are you

363
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,190
gonna be upset about this and boy oh boy

364
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:42,259
people were just thrilled they were just

365
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,810
thrilled about it because you know I

366
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:47,259
think deep down in you can be you can be

367
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:49,639
pro Trump anti Trump you could be Pro

368
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:52,610
you know any one of the Democratic

369
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,309
candidates and whatever deep down in all

370
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,409
of us understand that the ability to be

371
00:14:55,309 --> 00:15:00,679
able to grow a plant is a basic human

372
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:02,779
right and they've taken it away from us

373
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,179
in so many places and and we want it

374
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:07,069
back and we're getting it back and now

375
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:09,589
we have to now we have to use it

376
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,629
properly and so anyway that's a little

377
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,519
bit of a short box stuff right there so

378
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:15,830
so let's talk about the the the the

379
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,579
little grandma in the tennis sneakers

380
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:21,770
that you're referring to so so so

381
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,710
clearly those of us in the cannabis

382
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:27,049
scene we love the idea of promotion of

383
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,629
cannabis because in most cases it's our

384
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:31,309
favorite plant but then but but but your

385
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:34,039
audience that you're speaking to this

386
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:36,500
time with your book you

387
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:40,069
your audience are people who primarily

388
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,448
love gardening and the love of cannabis

389
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,149
may be new to them either because

390
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:45,679
they're you they've they're spending a

391
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:47,240
lot of money on topicals and they want

392
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,370
to make their own or they fall in love

393
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,810
with tinctures or or hell maybe they've

394
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,068
just decided that they they're in there

395
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,299
you know they've gotten over the taboo

396
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:55,669
and they love puffins in their home

397
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:57,649
whatever their reason you're speaking to

398
00:15:55,669 --> 00:16:00,740
this new audience of cannabis

399
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:03,440
enthusiasts and I would think that what

400
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,769
you're hearing from them about why

401
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,540
they're excited about the plant is often

402
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:10,429
different about what you hear from

403
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:12,198
cannabis people about why they're

404
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,179
excited about the plant and so I'm

405
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:16,789
curious what what kind of unique things

406
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:18,649
are you hearing from gardeners about

407
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:20,689
your introduction of cannabis and OTO

408
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:23,028
flowers that is different than what you

409
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:26,149
are getting from growers stoners like me

410
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:27,919
sure well first of all I've sort of

411
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,208
tested this over the whole you know I

412
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,578
don't I don't go out and just write a

413
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:34,609
book willy-nilly I got to do a little

414
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:37,370
bit of research and then I make the rest

415
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,949
of the stuff up but just kidding of

416
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,409
course but you know I so I talked to

417
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:45,620
gardeners in the Anchorage area right

418
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:47,179
where I live and about the fact that it

419
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,769
was legal and now they could grow plants

420
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:52,458
and and they were all trying to grow

421
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:55,578
regular regular plants what happens with

422
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:58,879
gardeners is we get bored you know it's

423
00:16:55,578 --> 00:17:01,489
you can grow a tomato year in and year

424
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,279
out and get great tomatoes it's boring

425
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:08,990
it's too easy and so what we look for

426
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:10,759
are new things to grow let's start with

427
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,740
new techniques every now and then come

428
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,740
along but what we really look for are

429
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,199
new things to grow and you and I've

430
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,000
talked about this before I remember and

431
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,970
maybe ear old enough to remember when

432
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,308
the snap pea was introduced to the

433
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,769
American gardener oh my god people went

434
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:29,928
nuts you know and and snap peas are now

435
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:31,819
do-rag or hero snap peas in your garden

436
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,500
they're easy to grow but I blab that it

437
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:36,200
tastes great you can use them stir fry

438
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,079
and you know so so people grow snap peas

439
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,990
you know tomatoes people bored with

440
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,579
tomatoes got into heirlooms why do they

441
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,859
get into heirlooms because though it was

442
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:47,710
different it was exciting it was it was

443
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:51,279
a way to introduce new

444
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:54,579
plants to your to your palette and and

445
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,670
and so all of a sudden you get legalized

446
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:59,889
cannabis and people who are really into

447
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,140
gardening who can get their hands on

448
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,240
either a clone or seed they grow a plant

449
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,430
and whether that whether they're

450
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,970
successful in getting a harvest or not

451
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,890
they are excited about growing that

452
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,470
cannabis plant all the way through to

453
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:17,200
wherever they get because for the true

454
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,360
gardener it's not the harvest it's not

455
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,450
the tomato it's not the marigold flower

456
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:26,019
you know that that you that makes

457
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:28,120
gardening terrific it's the process you

458
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:31,389
know it's it's it's watching the plant

459
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:33,939
grow and develop and and it's the beauty

460
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,490
of understanding you know that there are

461
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,259
cells being added because you because

462
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,970
there are microbes down on the soil at

463
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:42,579
our feet you know there's a beauty to it

464
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,240
all that's that that transcends just at

465
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:47,829
one moment where you pick the tomato you

466
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,599
know or you take the tomato over to your

467
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:51,189
neighbor and brag about it you know it's

468
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,009
the process of growing that makes

469
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,170
gardening fun and and cannabis is a fun

470
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:59,650
plant to grow it's it's it's got a lot

471
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:04,300
of distinct stages and when you when you

472
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:07,240
then go to an auto flowering plant the

473
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:09,250
fun becomes compressed into the same

474
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,819
length of time that it takes to grow a

475
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:15,730
tomato the plant itself is small you can

476
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:19,149
grow it in a five-gallon bucket you

477
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:23,039
watch it go literally from seed to

478
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:25,990
harvest in seven to nine weeks it

479
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,430
flowers or it it shows whether it's

480
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,809
gonna be a male or a female

481
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:34,420
oh isn't that incredible I never get a

482
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:36,730
phone call and then all of a sudden you

483
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,710
end up with a plant that you can't take

484
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,079
your eyes off on because it's growing

485
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:44,019
new leaves every day is getting bigger

486
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:49,329
literally every day I almost compare it

487
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:53,849
to growing a giant pumpkin they put on

488
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:56,230
40 pounds a night forty pounds a night

489
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:58,329
well when you watch an autoflowering

490
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,140
cannabis grow you go to bed you get up

491
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:03,659
the next morning and it's bigger don't

492
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,790
we'll be so measurably so that's an

493
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,740
exciting thing to have happen and then

494
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:11,579
you add on to that what you and I know

495
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,799
that is that that this is just one kind

496
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:18,319
of Auto flower cannabis plant

497
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:21,869
there's cannabis or plants that

498
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:24,720
definitely do all sorts of things like

499
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:27,179
CBD production or THC production you can

500
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,890
get different colors you can expose them

501
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,350
to cold cooler temperatures they turn

502
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,060
purple you know they're there they can

503
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:35,369
become a landscape plant you can put

504
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:38,250
them around your you know your yard your

505
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:40,589
walkways you know on your deck they're a

506
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,599
terrific plant on on top of being a

507
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:45,289
cannabis plant so Wow

508
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,339
it made for a great subject book

509
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:49,379
fantastic well how about this Jeff why

510
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,759
don't we address that that call coming

511
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,510
in on your side and take a short break

512
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,009
right now

513
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:54,960
we'll be right back you're listening to

514
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:57,500
shaping fire and my guest today is Lord

515
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,730
of the routes Jeff Lowenthal's

516
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,680
cultivators who grow in living soil are

517
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,660
very particular on what inputs they use

518
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,910
in their soil they educate themselves

519
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,279
and painstakingly create compost and

520
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,630
nutritive teas to create thriving soils

521
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,059
that will produce the very best

522
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,860
expression of the cannabis plant many

523
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,529
living soil farmers now believe that

524
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:18,449
over time seeds become acclimated to the

525
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:20,250
kind of substrate they are grown in for

526
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,840
example a seed that was bred and

527
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,430
synthetic fertilizers may not

528
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,230
immediately know what to do in a living

529
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,810

530
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,940
and decreasing yield the regenerative

531
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:32,039

532
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,049

533
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,359
cooperative only provide cannabis seeds

534
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:38,430
that were bred in living soil and using

535
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:40,679
probiotic growing techniques that way

536
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,539
when you germinate in soil the seeds

537
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,190
genetics will recognize the environment

538
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,740
and immediately start interacting with

539
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:49,620

welcome back you're listening to shaping

593
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,850
fire I'm your host Shango low sent our

594
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:50,069
guest this week is gardening author Jeff

595
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:51,778
Lowen fellows so during the first set we

596
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:53,819
talked a lot about your motivations for

597
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:55,919
the book and who the book is for and and

598
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:58,138
actually some really pretty poetic stuff

599
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,778
about the the enjoyment of gardening

600
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:02,668
that I'll share I'm sorry about that no

601
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:04,409
no that's good I think that's good and I

602
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:07,409
think that really speaks to the heart of

603
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:10,289
your book right this book really is for

604
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:12,840
people who are in love with plants

605
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:14,819
generally and to kind of encourage

606
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,849
people who are in love with plants and

607
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:20,128
gardening to come on over and and and

608
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:21,599
and start to share in the experience of

609
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:25,408
the black sheep of the family

610
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,028
in cannabis so so let's give people a

611
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:28,269
little bit of background on where Otto

612
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:29,848
flowers came from you know

613
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:34,118
clearly used we started the episode

614
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:35,769
talking about the 1970s and lowrider but

615
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:38,259
but I've heard you give your talk on

616
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:40,179
Auto flowers and and and you talking

617
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:44,019
about where they came from is kind of

618
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:46,179
exotic sure yeah so there was a

619
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:48,489
scientist he was working in the Volga

620
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:53,859
River area I guess that's in their Urals

621
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:56,348
and in Russia and and he he noticed

622
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:59,108
these little little teeny cabbage plants

623
00:24:56,348 --> 00:25:00,338
and and he looked at him and he studied

624
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:02,949
them a little bit and sure enough he

625
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:06,219
identified them as a new kind of

626
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,229
cannabis which he called ruderalis and

627
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:10,959
which which apparently means ruble

628
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:14,588
because these things grew in these

629
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:16,659
little rubble a terrible soil areas and

630
00:25:14,588 --> 00:25:18,848
what he noticed about him and the rear

631
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:21,309
and what really caught his attention was

632
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:27,128
that unlike regular cannabis these

633
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:30,128
particular plants bloomed before the

634
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:32,228
other ones did way before the other ones

635
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,259
did and and when he did his research he

636
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:37,119
discovered that in fact they were not

637
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,548
influenced by a photo period in other

638
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:42,249
words the the the triggering event for

639
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:45,489
flowering is is increased darkness

640
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:47,828
beyond 12 hours they bloomed because of

641
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:50,588
genetics so it didn't matter what the

642
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:53,548
daylight was or the darkness these

643
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:58,118
things bloomed and set a set period

644
00:25:53,548 --> 00:26:03,940
apparently they came from the they were

645
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:05,769
escapees from hemp plantations and you

646
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,129
know they they escaped and because of

647
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:10,598
evolution they they you know they

648
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:13,748
figured out that if they didn't seed

649
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:15,999
right away they before the frost they

650
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:19,259
weren't gonna make it and so so they

651
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:21,999
they bred into themselves this genetic

652
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:26,319
disposition the flower as opposed to

653
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:30,129
having the normal photo period flowering

654
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:32,858
so so that happened you know I mean it

655
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:36,248
was it was of interest but really nobody

656
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:39,218
could breed them to do anything that

657
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:41,860
made any sense and and it really wasn't

658
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:44,830
until the 1970s when

659
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:46,599
bunch of stoner guys frankly you know

660
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:50,558
started fooling around with them 60s I

661
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:52,449
guess obviously and and I think I think

662
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,730
when they came out in 1971 it was a

663
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,528
little bit early they were just there

664
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,500
was just a novelty plant nobody ever

665
00:26:56,528 --> 00:27:02,679
thought they were going to be any good

666
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:04,690
now again you know you know cannabis

667
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,288
growers they like to breed things and so

668
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:11,860
so people continually bred them not only

669
00:27:08,288 --> 00:27:13,839
with each other with but with their

670
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:17,319
cousins the bigger sativas and indicas

671
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:20,168
but also different ruderalis because you

672
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:23,980
can find ruderalis all around the world

673
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:26,850
it turns out so the particular ruderalis

674
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:30,038
that is in theory the one used for the

675
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:34,538
lowrider is said to have come from

676
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:35,829
either Finland or Mexico which I found

677
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:37,450
to be shocking because I thought oh

678
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:40,599
there must be in some they must be in a

679
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,490
cold climate but no ruderalis in Mexico

680
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:46,778
there ruderalis in Alaska there

681
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,548
ruderalis all over so you breed them

682
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:49,950
with different different ruderalis you

683
00:27:48,548 --> 00:27:53,589
breed them with different different

684
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:57,069
bigger parents and you end up with

685
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:59,528
different kinds of of autoflowering

686
00:27:57,069 --> 00:28:00,939
cannabis plants one of the things that

687
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:03,599
you mentioned in your your live

688
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:08,230
presentation about autos is is how

689
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:10,689
ruderalis are the really only cannabis

690
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,419
variety that really thrives in really

691
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,700
crappy low nutrient environments and I

692
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:18,610
find that really interesting because not

693
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,370
only does it show the the vigor to live

694
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:24,250
that are in these genetics but you also

695
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:26,168
then go and caution people to not feed

696
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,730
them like they would a regular cannabis

697
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:33,519
plant we break that out a bit for us

698
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:37,269
sure they they do the the one hat one

699
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,538
set of the parents do grow in very poor

700
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:42,339
conditions they grow very quickly

701
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:45,009
they've they've adapted to be able to

702
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:46,449
get what they need from a soil food web

703
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:49,148
perspective in other words they're

704
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,769
actually its produce the right stuff to

705
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:52,629
get the right bacteria and fungi and

706
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:54,369
they quickly they quickly take up

707
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,470
nutrients and they and they are capable

708
00:28:54,369 --> 00:29:00,839
of

709
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:02,940
being a very rapid pace of growth by

710
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:06,418
taking up their nutrients without any

711
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,759
help whatsoever from anybody now you

712
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:12,240
know we tend to forget that this is a

713
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:14,819
plant that we call weed and the reason

714
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,029
we call it weed is twofold one it grows

715
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:19,740
anywhere in theory and two it grows

716
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:22,408
quickly like a weed

717
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,490
well autoflowering cannabis is the weed

718
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:29,669
of weeds it really grows quickly and it

719
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,589
can grow anywhere what I've discovered

720
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:34,740
and I think other growers as well is

721
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:39,058
that if you feed these plants it messes

722
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,769
them up at least at least initially they

723
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:42,960
they have everything they need in that

724
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:45,900
seed if you if you put them in decent

725
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,319
soil living soil you're gonna get a

726
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:52,080
great plant if you feed that soil all

727
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,298
manner of nutrients as people tend to do

728
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,769
when they're growing cannabis you you

729
00:29:54,298 --> 00:30:00,538
end up with a plant that's that's

730
00:29:55,769 --> 00:30:04,500
confused that can adjust properly and

731
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:07,798
and they burn quickly they grow spindly

732
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:11,940
and you lose you lose the essence of

733
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:13,980
that great ruderalis that makes this

734
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,990
such an easy plant to grow I think this

735
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,700
is probably one of the reasons why so

736
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,798
many

737
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,590
I guess growers who've been growing for

738
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,119
a while have yet more reasons that they

739
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:26,038
personally don't like OTO flowers

740
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:28,319
because you know people work long and

741
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,629
hard to come up with their recipe for

742
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,359
growing and autos don't really fit in

743
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:38,850
most people's recipes they they really

744
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:40,829
do enjoy benign neglect like in a

745
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:43,349
perfect environment you'd have a no-till

746
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:45,240
pot that's already set up and you put

747
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:46,589
your seed in there and then you forget

748
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,240
about it and then you come back when

749
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:50,819
it's time to harvest and that freaks

750
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,009
people out yeah yeah it is pretty

751
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:54,629
amazing and you can see one of the

752
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:57,379
reasons why it was developed I mean you

753
00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:00,780
know if you were if you were a

754
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,429
clandestine grower you know you could

755
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:04,710
grow these things under your under your

756
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:06,120
stairs without ever having to go in and

757
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,769
look at them you know you put an

758
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,239
automatic watering system in you leave

759
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:13,079
you leave the lights on

760
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,809
our 24 hours holy crow you know you

761
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,339
don't have to do anything to them you

762
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:20,009
don't even have to give them darkness

763
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:27,779
well that that that makes for pretty

764
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:30,990
exciting you know yeah time whoo so yeah

765
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:33,240
so these plants really are so easy to

766
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,609
grow that it does frustrate the

767
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,019
professional grower a little bit you

768
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:41,039
know they turn their nose up at them

769
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:43,230
they're you know by the same token a lot

770
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,389
of professional growers use their

771
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,860
current system to grow these things and

772
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,170
they don't do well and then they

773
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:51,750
badmouth the auto flower plant which I

774
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:56,150
have to have to tell listeners are now

775
00:31:51,750 --> 00:32:01,410
becoming a normally used plant in many

776
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:06,600
commercial grows both hemp I should say

777
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:10,470
all hemp CBD and THC in Oregon the main

778
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:15,179
breeder of these seeds only sells now to

779
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:16,920
commercial growers and you know the

780
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,700
reason is is because they come out so

781
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,570
uniform right good seeds are right

782
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,190
because that that is one of the

783
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:25,589
challenges with auto flower seeds at

784
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,559
this point is you get a lot of different

785
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:30,119
fee knows in one pack generally but the

786
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,849
people at the top of the auto flower

787
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,769
game you know this is not true for all

788
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:37,439
seeds the top the top right seeds will

789
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:39,599
all be exactly the same in uniform but I

790
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,210
would say that that is a very small

791
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,980
fraction at the very top when most

792
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,079
everybody I mean this summer we popped a

793
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,210
lot of Auto flower seeds on Vashon and

794
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,789
we would get you know three footers and

795
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,710
5-footers out of the same pack right

796
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:54,839
yeah and I think I think part of that

797
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:57,900
has to do with the fact that they are so

798
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:00,089
easy to grow and so what you've got are

799
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:03,480
a lot of people who are who are buying

800
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:05,369
seeds in them and then further selling

801
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,680
them on so you got middlemen selling

802
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:09,959
seeds you know and and they don't know

803
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,360
what they are no and really you know

804
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,069
they haven't tested them etc etc now you

805
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:17,549
and I both know that that there are

806
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:20,730
companies that have perfected their seed

807
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:22,649
breeding programs and you can find most

808
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,460
of these companies I don't think we want

809
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,559
to give too many names

810
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,298
but I you can find these companies by

811
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:30,599
going on to the internet

812
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:34,308
autoflowering network.com

813
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:40,490
or is it auto flowering or no flower

814
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:43,528
Netcom has a whole bunch of discussion

815
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,819
threads about seed companies and which

816
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:46,740
ones are good and which ones aren't and

817
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:50,460
the companies themselves are represented

818
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,349
there and so that is the one area I

819
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,690
think needs to improve sort of

820
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:56,369
chicken-and-egg I wrote a book about

821
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,070
about a plant that you might have

822
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:02,489
difficulty getting seeds you know at

823
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:02,939
your local seed store yeah that's for

824
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,798
sure

825
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,798
and for the record it's auto flower

826
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,838
dotnet oh good yeah totally yeah it's

827
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:13,980
funny for being so simple it's really

828
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:16,369
easy to throw extra words in there but

829
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,980
it is a terrific site if anybody even

830
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:22,619
the inkling of interest in these plants

831
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,679
this is the place to go after you bought

832
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:29,369
the book because you will get all of the

833
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:33,179
bud porn that you're accustomed to all

834
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:35,669
of the ranting and raving z' of

835
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,769
technique and flushing not flushing that

836
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,440
you're used to you know it's just but

837
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:42,539
it's on auto flowers and I gotta say

838
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,700
that you know auto flower dotnet was

839
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,858
formed because the auto flower folks got

840
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,809
harassed and laughed out of so many of

841
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:51,418
the grower forums then they just went

842
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:53,579
and and did their own and you can still

843
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:55,799
feel that because the community is very

844
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,139
kind and I actually find that all across

845
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,310
the whole auto flower scene the people

846
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,049
who are growing them the people who are

847
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:02,969
breeding the seeds you know the the

848
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,570
green rush really hasn't come to auto

849
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:09,929
flowers yet and so people are very

850
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,670
modest and kind and you know the thirst

851
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:14,608
jerks in every scene right but but

852
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:17,909
overall I really enjoy being a part of

853
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:19,710
the auto flower scene because it it's

854
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:22,289
not as cutthroat as some of the other

855
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,179
cannabis industry let me put it in the

856
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,469
vernacular of the book it's because

857
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:28,829
people who grow auto flowers are

858
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:30,480
gardeners and gardeners share they share

859
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:33,119
information we'll talk about it later on

860
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,039
they share food you know that gardeners

861
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,750
share it's when you get into the

862
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,529
commercial world and you you know that

863
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,329
your

864
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,769
you want to get competitive that you

865
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:43,500
stop sharing and you stop being a

866
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:45,690
gardener and you start becoming a farmer

867
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,099
well you know well maybe don't share

868
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,950
quite as much as gardeners do but I

869
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:52,019
think that's a hallmark of gardening and

870
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:54,419
and I'm hopeful that gardeners who are

871
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:56,699
capable of growing these plants and have

872
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,470
seeds will share them and etc etc

873
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:02,669
because it's it's that's what gardeners

874
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:05,039
do perfectly right on so let's talk a

875
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,829
little bit about the growing of the

876
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,259
plant and some of the uniquenesses that

877
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:13,409
come with growing a plant that grows so

878
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:18,320
fast so right so I dropped in briefly

879
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:21,059
that that you know the plant loves to be

880
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,590
germinated in its soil because it's got

881
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:25,320
such a short life it doesn't like to be

882
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:27,539
trans transplanted very much because the

883
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,400
the momentary stress actually takes a

884
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:31,980
significant part of its of its lifetime

885
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,630
but I also said that it likes to be put

886
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:39,269
into a pot that's already been grown in

887
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:42,900
and has not been not fresh soil so what

888
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:45,210
we think of as no-till and and what I'd

889
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,490
like you to talk about is you know not a

890
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,960
lot of people use no-till techniques yet

891
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:51,869
people are still of the mind that you

892
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,490
have to use fresh potting soil with with

893
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:58,409
every new grow but at the same time the

894
00:36:55,489 --> 00:37:01,409
mycorrhizal fungi that you need to form

895
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:03,719
to move nutrients around the pot barely

896
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:08,369
have time to form in the entire lifetime

897
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:11,039
of an auto flower plant and so how do

898
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:13,019
these plants I mean we you know we both

899
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,360
seen the flowers the flowers can be as

900
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:17,940
as large as your forearm they're huge :

901
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:23,220
or not they're not lacking in size how

902
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:25,170
is this plant doing so much in soil that

903
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:28,289
for most people it was what we would

904
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:30,090
consider new soil yeah well first of all

905
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:31,619
let's talk about that the concept of

906
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,660
throwing your soil away every time you

907
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:35,400
grow plant and then and then starting

908
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,889
over again you know that's that's old

909
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,450
school as far as I'm concerned for a

910
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:42,420
couple of reasons not the least of which

911
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:43,919
it's not regenitive it's not sustainable

912
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,889
at work you know we

913
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,420
we're losing soil like no one's business

914
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:50,608
in this world and

915
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,740
and we gotta be we got it we got to keep

916
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:55,619
it and we got to maintain it so but so

917
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:58,108
so what happens when you grow a plant is

918
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,880
it you know the root system develops it

919
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:02,400
drips out all these extra dates it

920
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,200
attracts the kinds of micro Rises are

921
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,510
you not migrate them well it attracts

922
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:10,710
both mycorrhizal fungi but it also

923
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:13,319
attracts you know the bacteria and the

924
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:16,019
other kinds of fungi that it needs in

925
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:17,400
order to be able to feed itself doesn't

926
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:19,169
matter what kind of plant it is that's

927
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,950
just the way plants work that's teeming

928
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:26,400
with microbes and and so this particular

929
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:28,139
plant when you plant it does just like

930
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,380
every other plant does all of these

931
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:35,009
things when you plant it in brand-new

932
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:40,140
soil it it it it has to create its own

933
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:44,640
growth channels it has to really scream

934
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:48,509
loudly to these to these microbes to get

935
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:52,379
in into the zone and you know it really

936
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:56,849
has to do do some work to establish the

937
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:59,099
kind of environment that it needs in

938
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:02,759
order to be able to feed itself when you

939
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,980
plant in a pot that's already had a

940
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:07,199
cannabis plant growing in it the

941
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,490
microbes that support cannabis are

942
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:13,879
already in that pot they're just dormant

943
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:16,558
they're there in the right numbers

944
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,140
immediately you don't have to you know

945
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,970
you don't have to attract them you don't

946
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:23,429
have to gather them together and this is

947
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:26,038
all shorthand for you know what happens

948
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:27,778
is the right microbes have to take out

949
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,700
the bad microbes so that the right

950
00:39:27,778 --> 00:39:31,889
balance is there's all of this stuff has

951
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:36,509
already happened in your previous grow

952
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:38,940
and as important the roots of the plant

953
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:43,920
have an opportunity to grow in the

954
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:47,190
channels left by the old root channel

955
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,170
system and so it's easier for not only

956
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:54,059
is it easier for them but there are

957
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:56,519
decaying or carbon-containing old roots

958
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,440
in those channels that are helping to

959
00:39:56,518 --> 00:40:00,538
feed and maintain those microbial

960
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,230
populations that are supporting the

961
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:04,720
plant so so for that

962
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:08,108
reason it makes sense to grow almost any

963
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:10,239
kind of a plant in a pot that's had a

964
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:11,739
similar plant growing in it previously

965
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,319
did you trust that before you go on did

966
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:17,579
you just say that there's karma left in

967
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,400
the roots okay well there's karma and

968
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:23,769
carbon/carbon okay carve it all right I

969
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,358
like the idea of karma though but it is

970
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:27,099
karma I mean you know that's what that's

971
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,500
what that's what makes the plants grow

972
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:31,868
it's that carbon you know

973
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,760
carbon is karma you don't have carbon

974
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:38,980
you don't have karma you don't have life

975
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:42,520
so anyway so then you take a plant that

976
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:46,090
has genetically developed to grow

977
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:47,889
quickly Wow you know well if you give

978
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,660
that plant what it needs from the get-go

979
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:53,440
it gets going

980
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:55,299
so we plant these things we you can

981
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,940
start them at using you know the paper

982
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,740
towel trick etc etc and I and I do I do

983
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,550
most of mine that way for one simple

984
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:07,299
reason because I then I dust both the

985
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:09,730
seed and that brand new root which which

986
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:13,119
appears incidentally usually within

987
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:15,340
about 24 hours as opposed to a little

988
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,220
bit longer or almost twice as long with

989
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:24,160
regular cannabis plants I then sprinkle

990
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:26,829
a rise of faggus interest CDs which is

991
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:30,159
the mycorrhizal fungi that feeds

992
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:32,319
cannabis plants I and so I know I'm

993
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:36,190
getting the exposure on the roots right

994
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:39,609
away and then I plant that in the soil

995
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:42,070
in the pot that I'm gonna grow the plant

996
00:41:39,608 --> 00:41:46,179
in for its entire life these plants

997
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:48,010
cannot be root bound a root bound plant

998
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:50,319
while it while they're growing to their

999
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:53,800
initial to their to their size a root

1000
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,590
bound plants we you know as a lot of

1001
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,180
problems getting what it needs and you

1002
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,829
don't want these plants to be root bound

1003
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:01,029
because they're growing so quickly you

1004
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:04,840
want him to be able to get whatever they

1005
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:07,540
need right away and and so you put them

1006
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:11,950
in a five or seven gallon pot three

1007
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:14,650
gallon minimum and and that's it that's

1008
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:16,528
the pot you want to use and you don't

1009
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,959
have to transplant them

1010
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:23,920
every time you transplant a plant you

1011
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:25,858
are destroying root hairs then our that

1012
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,539
take a while for the plant to come back

1013
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:30,969
you stress a plant you can you can

1014
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:33,400
stress a plant out it can slow down for

1015
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:35,438
a week or so anytime you transplant it

1016
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,028
and when you transplant these and they

1017
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:38,708
lose a week that you're because they

1018
00:42:37,028 --> 00:42:41,079
grow so fast that's a significant part

1019
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:42,548
of their life you know it's like being

1020
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:44,349
away while your kids are going through

1021
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:45,880
elementary school and then all of a

1022
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:49,180
sudden you're back you go what happened

1023
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,579
you know yeah exactly right he's got to

1024
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:53,139
be there for these guys every single

1025
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:56,259
minute of the day because they're

1026
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:58,509
growing so quickly so Jeff oh sorry yeah

1027
00:42:56,259 --> 00:43:00,579
so so so then the other thing of course

1028
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,769
is to make sure that you've got the

1029
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,239
right soil we've talked about the fact

1030
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:06,068
that you don't want to soil is rich in

1031
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,909
nutrients it's great to have a soil

1032
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:10,989
that's been used once before at least

1033
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:14,409
but you gotta have a soil that drains

1034
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:16,659
well any plant needs that these are just

1035
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:19,420
like tomato plants and so in fact hey

1036
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:22,208
guess what the same stuff that you can

1037
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,489
use for growing tomatoes you can use for

1038
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:26,198
growing these plants it's got a good

1039
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:29,079
drainage it's gotta have lots of

1040
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:30,639
organics we do not use chemicals on

1041
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,709
these plants because we don't use

1042
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:36,368
chemicals on any plants chemicals are

1043
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:39,188
done organic we don't go non-organic we

1044
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:42,699
only use organics because it's good for

1045
00:43:39,188 --> 00:43:46,088
the environment and it's because we put

1046
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:47,229
this stuff into our systems so we want

1047
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:49,420
to make sure that they're they're nice

1048
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:51,338
and organic if you have to feed the

1049
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,289
plant you wait for the plant to tell you

1050
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:55,630
that it needs something and these plans

1051
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:57,429
well if they need something because

1052
00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:00,068
they're growing so quickly you'll see

1053
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:03,039
the sign very quickly and if you get on

1054
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:04,389
it very quickly you you can you can give

1055
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,809
them what they need now what would you

1056
00:44:04,389 --> 00:44:11,469
feed them with you know you can get a a

1057
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:14,349
you know a good balanced you know I

1058
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:16,958
don't know a two to two or something in

1059
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:20,739
that area type type liquid fertilizer

1060
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:22,509
organic and you can give that to the

1061
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:24,309
plant and and you'll see a different

1062
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:29,860
right away compost tea works very very

1063
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:32,019
very nicely I like a little bacteria

1064
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,090
to compost tea on these guys so so you

1065
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:35,559
see some problems you can use that and

1066
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:38,620
you can you always water with compost

1067
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:40,480
tea all that all the way along because

1068
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:44,230
she can't over water with compost tea it

1069
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,269
doesn't over feed a plant so there we go

1070
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:49,389
so when we've been talking about these

1071
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:51,340
these fast-growing plants I remember the

1072
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:53,559
first time I came across Otto flowers

1073
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,630
and and then you brought it home for me

1074
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:57,940
at Emerald cup when we talked about last

1075
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:00,340
year when when we were talking about how

1076
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:03,880
they go from germination to harvest in

1077
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:06,640
90 days not 90 days of you know flower

1078
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,950
but the entire life span and being

1079
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,079
finished and being not being light

1080
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:12,730
dependent which means that if you live

1081
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:15,670
somewhere that's got inclement weather

1082
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:17,619
or short summers like the Pacific

1083
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:20,289
Northwest where I live or for goodness

1084
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:22,150
sakes Alaska where you live but but also

1085
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:25,029
you know the New England states and and

1086
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:27,519
far far south of the Equator we all

1087
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:30,610
don't necessarily have enough summer to

1088
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,559
grow regular plants but then right

1089
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:34,480
you've grits something like this and you

1090
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:38,230
take an auto flower and you can

1091
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,829
germinate on say June 1 and it grows

1092
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:43,750
June July and August and you you harvest

1093
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:46,269
on September 1st well before the rains

1094
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:48,730
like when I first realize that literally

1095
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:51,699
blew my mind because this opens up so

1096
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:54,179
much for for patients and for gardeners

1097
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:57,460
like you're talking about and and for

1098
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:59,919
you know anybody who does not want to

1099
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,579
deal with mold and botrytis at the end

1100
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,409
of the year

1101
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:06,190
where I'm going with this though is that

1102
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:08,710
I had that mindset at 90 days but then

1103
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:11,950
now there are these new cultivars that

1104
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:13,329
are 60 days and now people are telling

1105
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:16,539
me that they've grown these 30 days

1106
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:19,029
which I have yet to grow but a 30 day

1107
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:20,289
from germination to finish flowers you

1108
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,880
know I'm like I can except it's not

1109
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:24,039
gonna be a huge plant but the fact that

1110
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,200
it goes through its life spans so

1111
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:30,519
quickly blows me away my question for

1112
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:33,369
you is is how do we get to 90 60 and 30

1113
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:36,670
day varietals when they're all crossed

1114
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:38,650
with rudy' right well there are

1115
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:41,349
different kinds of ruderalis first of

1116
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:43,539
all and so some some ruderalis take

1117
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:47,409
longer bloom than others

1118
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:48,610
and I was stunned to start receiving in

1119
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:51,460
the mail different kinds of ruderalis

1120
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:53,200
sees that people have collected and and

1121
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,280
and so that's the first reason the

1122
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,119
second reason is of course you're

1123
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,340
breeding them with plants that also have

1124
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,920
some genetics and and there's something

1125
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:08,260
in some of those plants you know that

1126
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:10,539
impacts the duration of the of the the

1127
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,030
growth period so so it's sort of a

1128
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:16,150
double whammy it's something coming from

1129
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:18,190
the from the sativa indica z-- and then

1130
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:21,940
it's the difference in in the genetics

1131
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:23,260
of the ruderalis itself so let's go

1132
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,869
ahead and take our second short break

1133
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:28,360
and we come back and do set three we're

1134
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:30,369
gonna talk a little bit about succession

1135
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:33,519
planning from Otto flowers which which

1136
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:35,289
is an interesting idea with cannabis but

1137
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:36,519
also jeff has agreed to talk a little

1138
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:37,659
bit about his background which we

1139
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:39,759
haven't really heard a lot about so

1140
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:40,690
that'll be cool so you are listening to

1141
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,520
shaping fire

1142
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,050
I'm your host Shingo Lowe's and our

science regenerative organic cannabis

calm cannabis is fun medicine and we

1221

love to celebrate it cannabis connects

1222

people and creates opportunities for new

1223

friendships at the top shop we create

1227
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,599
gifts too i'm ashley Villafranca owner

1228
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:51,490
of the taupe shop I came to cannabis as

1229
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,619
a patient seeking an alternative to the

1230
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:56,469
pharmaceuticals being pushed at me for

1231
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:58,358
chronic pain and fibromyalgia I realized

1232
00:50:56,469 --> 00:51:00,459
that not only was cannabis a huge help

1233
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,460
in controlling my symptoms but I found

1234
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:05,889
cannabis to be wonderfully social too

1235
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:08,170
cannabis makes friends so I took my love

1236
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:10,568
of jewelry design and blended it with my

1237
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:11,329
newfound passion for cannabis and began

1238
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,670
handcraft

1239
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:15,889
bracelets earrings and friendship

1240
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,809
necklaces and then expanded to many

1241
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:20,230
clips rolling chaise and other home

1242
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:21,619
furnishings all made in sterling silver

1243
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,179
14-karat gold

1244
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:25,639
and aluminum so there's something for

1245
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:27,769
everyone's budget I consider it all to

1246
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:30,650

1260
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:05,480
Osan our guest this week is gardening

1261
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:07,610
author Jeff Lowen fellas so last set we

1262
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,820
talked a little bit about how the plant

1263
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:14,510
thinks and how best it care for her and

1264
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:15,980
how rare her nutrient intake is one of

1265
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:19,310
the things that we just hinted on before

1266
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:21,889
the commercial was the the fact that she

1267
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:24,920
grows so quickly that you can actually

1268
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:30,319
do multiple rounds during the summer and

1269
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:33,139
and and certainly you can do cannabis

1270
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,330
plants end to end or auto flower plants

1271
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:38,690
end to end where you you start something

1272
00:52:35,329 --> 00:52:41,389
in May and then you finish it in July

1273
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:45,920
and then go ahead and replant right in

1274
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:50,299
the pot but because succession planning

1275
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:52,639
is so rare in cannabis for photo photo

1276
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,830
sensitive plants Jeff I don't think that

1277
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:57,469
a lot of people who grow cannabis only

1278
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:59,509
and not vegetables understand the idea

1279
00:52:57,469 --> 00:53:02,149
of secession succession planning that we

1280
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,280
get from other quick to bulk crops like

1281
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,530
lettuce --is and stuff right so would

1282
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,140
you go ahead and explain succession

1283
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:10,460
planning and how it can apply to auto

1284
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:13,309
flowers that you saw that you've got a

1285
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,539
rolling harvest throughout the year well

1286
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:17,299
there's there's a couple of ways to

1287
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:20,179
apply it out outdoors if you're a

1288
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:23,090
regular gardener you you know that you

1289
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:24,639
just don't plant a you know a crop of

1290
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,858
lettuce or rather

1291
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,750
these quick growing things you plant

1292
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:30,578
several of them and there's two ways to

1293
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:32,469
do it one is you wait until your first

1294
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:35,349
crop is finished you plant a second crop

1295
00:53:32,469 --> 00:53:37,000
or you wait a couple of weeks after you

1296
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:39,130
put the first crop in and then you plant

1297
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,500
the second crop so that you have what's

1298
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:44,470
known as they continue as harvest at the

1299
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,449
end of the season and and that's how

1300
00:53:44,469 --> 00:53:48,368
lots of people grow lettuce so that they

1301
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:50,618
they have lettuce every every night

1302
00:53:48,369 --> 00:53:53,410
instead of just having it all you know

1303
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:55,450
all at once where the Otto flowers you

1304
00:53:53,409 --> 00:53:58,298
can do the same thing you can you can

1305
00:53:55,449 --> 00:54:00,068
either plant the plant wait for it to

1306
00:53:58,298 --> 00:54:02,409
harvest and then plant a new plant in

1307
00:54:00,068 --> 00:54:04,630
the same pot or you can get another pot

1308
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:06,759
after two or three weeks and start a new

1309
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:09,099
plants so that you have a rolling

1310
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,990
rolling harvest kind of a nice way to go

1311
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:12,818
because it's a sometimes it's sort of a

1312
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:14,798
pain to clean these plants and you know

1313
00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:17,768
prepare them for drying it's nice that

1314
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:20,949
maybe maybe extend the process and if

1315
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:24,009
you're an indoor commercial grower you

1316
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:27,639
can use these plants in a similar kind

1317
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:29,710
of sort of quasi succession way if

1318
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:32,920
you're growing in your veg stage you

1319
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:36,309
could put these plants in between your

1320
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,889
your bigger the bigger cousins that have

1321
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:40,509
a photo period and similarly once

1322
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:42,159
they're in flower you can do this you

1323
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:44,079
know the bigger cousins are and you go

1324
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,608
to the flower stage you can do the same

1325
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,349
thing you can either start new ones or

1326
00:54:45,608 --> 00:54:49,028
you can finish off your honors but

1327
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:52,930
normally what happens is your Otto's

1328
00:54:49,028 --> 00:54:55,088
flower and and are harvested at the same

1329
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:56,858
time you then flip the switch and get

1330
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:59,078
into the flowering stage and on the big

1331
00:54:56,858 --> 00:55:01,960
guy so you go from vegetative and it's

1332
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:04,380
it's just sort of neat that you can add

1333
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,659
on to your existing harvest either by

1334
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,490
repeating the same plant or by using

1335
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:11,710
these plants to supplement what you're

1336
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:13,808
growing elsewhere we all have the

1337
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,519
experience of coming up to harvest and

1338
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:18,460
then suddenly having a whole bunch of

1339
00:55:15,518 --> 00:55:20,979
plants to dry and trim at the same time

1340
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:23,289
and for folks who are not professionals

1341
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:25,449
you know normally we are hanging the

1342
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:27,940
plants in our living room or our in our

1343
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:30,009
basement or the garage or whatever and

1344
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,289
we only have a limited amount of space

1345
00:55:30,009 --> 00:55:34,659
that I mean heck some people are drying

1346
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:36,490
in their closets and that's one a thing

1347
00:55:34,659 --> 00:55:37,869
that's really great for the home grower

1348
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:40,989
the patient grower the

1349
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:42,460
gartner that if you want to start seeds

1350
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:45,039
this week and next week and the

1351
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,360
following week depending on you know

1352
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,719
your room maybe amount and make it every

1353
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:51,340
three weeks this idea that you could be

1354
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,809
harvesting in you know the beginning of

1355
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:55,269
the July and then the end of July and

1356
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:58,719
then the middle of September and then it

1357
00:55:55,269 --> 00:56:01,900
really allows you to be more productive

1358
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,579
with less space and also if you live in

1359
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,519
a state that only allows four or six

1360
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:09,340
plants and you're gonna bother to stay

1361
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:11,409
within the law it's like okay fine you

1362
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:14,470
know I'm gonna grow my six plants but

1363
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:17,440
I'm gonna do I'm gonna do six four times

1364
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:18,549
this summer instead of six that's caring

1365
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,980
the last fall summer and that's all I

1366
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,450
get and sure granted and generally the

1367
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:25,210
the plants are still smaller than

1368
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:27,549
full-sized plants but when you add all

1369
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:30,490
the grams and the convenience together

1370
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:32,200
at the end of the summer for most people

1371
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:34,449
it's gonna make a lot more sense to do

1372
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:36,849
this kind of succession planning oh yeah

1373
00:56:34,449 --> 00:56:38,739
and you get to grow different kinds of

1374
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:40,659
plants so I you know I don't know about

1375
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:43,959
you but after after a while you know

1376
00:56:40,659 --> 00:56:45,730
using the same cannabis week in and week

1377
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,260
out like we used to do with during

1378
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:49,449
Prohibition when you you know didn't

1379
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:52,180
have a source of different kinds you

1380
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:54,759
know you it's not the same it's not the

1381
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:57,069
same high it doesn't have the same

1382
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,600
effect but being able to have variety oh

1383
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:01,180
yeah that's the waiting you know variety

1384
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,279
is the spice of life and so so so the

1385
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:05,980
OTO flowers it's just like Tomatoes I

1386
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,890
keep saying this is the next tomato

1387
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:12,369
plant you can grow so many different

1388
00:57:08,889 --> 00:57:14,679
kinds you can grow constantly always

1389
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:16,329
have arborist and and so far we've

1390
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:19,059
really really been talking about growing

1391
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:22,090
them outside but they grow indoors in

1392
00:57:19,059 --> 00:57:23,349
the wintertime and everybody needs to

1393
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:27,070
have a set of lights in the wintertime

1394
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:28,719
anyhow for their other plants you know

1395
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,640
your house plants need need like if

1396
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,349
you're a gardener you need a set of

1397
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:35,139
lights I always try to tell people in

1398
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:37,179
America because I write nationally you

1399
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:38,920
need a set of lights in the winter we

1400
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:40,809
all need lights in the winter well

1401
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,579
plants need lights in the winter well

1402
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:44,259
you've got lights to grow your other

1403
00:57:42,579 --> 00:57:46,000
house plants you can be growing

1404
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,850
autoflowering cannabis plants as well

1405
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,579
and now that there's enough really good

1406
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:53,528
you know full-spectrum

1407
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:55,690
going lights out there it's gonna you

1408
00:57:53,528 --> 00:57:57,998
know the same location that can use

1409
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:00,309
these plans most like up here us up in

1410
00:57:57,998 --> 00:58:01,958
the North right it also helps with our

1411
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:04,690
seasonal effectiveness disorder from

1412
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:09,989
lack of Sun for in in two ways the

1413
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:13,119
product itself yeah yeah absolutely

1414
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:17,079
it's fun it's there's so much fun to

1415
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:19,599
grow I mean yeah you know a plant that

1416
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:23,170
you've never seen before

1417
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:26,559
unfurling before your eyes is a thing of

1418
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:28,659
beauty it's uh you know it's oh wow you

1419
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,119
know it's a mind-blower and these plants

1420
00:58:28,659 --> 00:58:32,588
are mind-blowing and one of the things

1421
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,849
that I liked about it is actually one of

1422
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:35,978
the things that some people complain

1423
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:39,039
about it's like okay yeah sometimes the

1424
00:58:35,978 --> 00:58:40,958
seeds are you know they maybe they're

1425
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,579
stable as far as like her mning but

1426
00:58:40,958 --> 00:58:44,379
they're not all the same right you're

1427
00:58:42,579 --> 00:58:46,568
gonna get a lot of differents Fino in

1428
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:49,059
the same pack more often than not and

1429
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:53,259
and they express some traits that are

1430
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:54,640
from the ruderalis often though though

1431
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:56,619
you know these generalizations are

1432
00:58:54,639 --> 00:59:00,278
certainly not applicable to the entire

1433
00:58:56,619 --> 00:59:02,289
you know family of cultivars right right

1434
00:59:00,278 --> 00:59:05,170
but after you know growing them this was

1435
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:06,579
my second summer growing them I really

1436
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,798
and you know as somebody who loves

1437
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:11,528
cannabis loves the plant is interested

1438
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:13,349
in cannabis botany it was interesting to

1439
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:17,318
see all these different

1440
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:20,079
terpene profiles and and how the plant

1441
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:22,778
presents itself over the last two years

1442
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:26,259
I actually had a grower here on the

1443
00:59:22,778 --> 00:59:28,329
island who is a cannabis patient and she

1444
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:31,719
just does a few plants on her deck every

1445
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:33,609
year and you know she grew a set of Otto

1446
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:36,729
flowers in the spring and then she had

1447
00:59:33,608 --> 00:59:38,228
her full terms and and when she

1448
00:59:36,728 --> 00:59:39,848
harvested or where she was going to

1449
00:59:38,228 --> 00:59:41,948
harvest her Otto flowers she sent me

1450
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:45,219
pictures he's like is this is this

1451
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:47,588
smokeable this is this right and the can

1452
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:49,659
and you know it was a particularly

1453
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:52,170
unusual looking canvas plant it was it

1454
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:53,409
was clearly a happy plant with lots of

1455
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:56,889
trichomes

1456
00:59:53,409 --> 01:00:00,699
and it smelled great but for those of us

1457
00:59:56,889 --> 01:00:02,139
who grow regular plants it would the

1458
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:04,579
plant kind of looked like it was all Fox

1459
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:06,139
tailed and so for

1460
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:07,519
for those of us who have been growing or

1461
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:09,768
while I'll be like third that is a

1462
01:00:07,518 --> 01:00:12,108
that's a mutant that's a weird thing but

1463
01:00:09,768 --> 01:00:14,389
actually the plant smelled great and was

1464
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:17,298
awesome smoke and it was just expressing

1465
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:19,759
some of these oddities that come from

1466
01:00:17,298 --> 01:00:21,170
the Rudy side and so you know was it

1467
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:22,998
necessarily something that you're gonna

1468
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:25,309
want to put in the centerfold of High

1469
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:26,358
Times well maybe maybe not it probably

1470
01:00:25,309 --> 01:00:28,640
would have gotten some really difficult

1471
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:31,308
feedback from people but as somebody who

1472
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:33,438
loves to watch nature express itself it

1473
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:35,778
sure as hell is interesting yeah you

1474
01:00:33,438 --> 01:00:38,239
know if we could become so accustomed to

1475
01:00:35,778 --> 01:00:40,039
blood poured yeah which is which is sort

1476
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,259
of meaningless when you think about it I

1477
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,150
mean I had so much rather see I loved it

1478
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:46,519
I mean but I'd much rather see a chart

1479
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:49,309
that tells me what the terpene you know

1480
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:51,948
a profile is but and the flavonoid

1481
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:54,259
profile because that tells me what the

1482
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:56,059
beauty of the plant is it's not how the

1483
01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:58,429
plant actually everything looks oh but

1484
01:00:56,059 --> 01:01:01,729
yes you're right you get some very

1485
01:00:58,429 --> 01:01:03,410
strange looking things sometimes and and

1486
01:01:01,728 --> 01:01:06,078
you wonder where did that come from and

1487
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:08,178
then you you know you gotta just that's

1488
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,519
part of the wonder of these things this

1489
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:13,400
is a plant growing before our eyes

1490
01:01:10,518 --> 01:01:14,568
evolving before our eyes you this is

1491
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,778
something you would have the capability

1492
01:01:14,568 --> 01:01:21,048
of being able to breed yourself you know

1493
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:23,059
it's just this is why I think it's

1494
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:25,159
America's next tomato plant it's just

1495
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:27,949
something that's fun to be with and work

1496
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:29,778
with and grow so and and your friend

1497
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:32,209
your friend you know my I would have

1498
01:01:29,778 --> 01:01:34,179
said to your friend don't forget you can

1499
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:39,948
grow these in the winter too

1500
01:01:34,179 --> 01:01:42,769
yeah doors by that would give so so Jeff

1501
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:46,519
before we wrap up you know when you and

1502
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:48,588
I did the the 10 video shaping fire

1503
01:01:46,518 --> 01:01:51,169
sessions which since this is going to

1504
01:01:48,588 --> 01:01:55,788
come out on October 22nd all 10 episodes

1505
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:57,739
are now out and so so you and I got

1506
01:01:55,789 --> 01:02:01,278
together and we recorded these and we we

1507
01:01:57,739 --> 01:02:03,380
had some time in between videos and and

1508
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:05,449
you were willing to share some of your

1509
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:08,298
background with me because most of us in

1510
01:02:05,449 --> 01:02:10,338
cannabis know about you as the the lord

1511
01:02:08,298 --> 01:02:12,259
of the roots the writer of the you know

1512
01:02:10,338 --> 01:02:14,298
teeming with microbes teeming with fungi

1513
01:02:12,259 --> 01:02:16,369
and teeming with nutrients series that

1514
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:18,230
is is you know essential reading and

1515
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:20,059
cannabis which I didn't understand

1516
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,800
to later is also essential reading and

1517
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:25,389
gardening but you know for those of us

1518
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:27,560
in cannabis it was it's a holy trilogy

1519
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:28,969
but then you and I got to start talking

1520
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:31,279
and and and I've done enough

1521
01:02:28,969 --> 01:02:32,659
introductions for you before that that

1522
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,820
when I get to the part where I where I

1523
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:36,649
say that you are you know a recovering

1524
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:38,750
attorney everybody kind of chuckles and

1525
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:41,900
we move on but it wasn't until we talked

1526
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:44,599
that I realized what a serious big

1527
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:46,460
player power attorney you were and at

1528
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:48,349
the same time you were remaining

1529
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,849
interesting and gardening so just

1530
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:51,829
because I've never heard this covered

1531
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:54,230
anywhere else will you tell us a little

1532
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:56,089
bit about your your life as an attorney

1533
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:58,969
that was running parallel to your

1534
01:02:56,088 --> 01:03:01,699
interest in gardening yeah well I went I

1535
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:04,250
went to law school in Boston and while I

1536
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:06,108
was there I was on a date with a lovely

1537
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:09,710
young lady who happen to be a nurse and

1538
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:11,869
and we were held up I was shot she saved

1539
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:14,630
my life I woke up the next morning she

1540
01:03:11,869 --> 01:03:17,630
was there with my glasses in my law

1541
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:20,088
school textbooks and I you know I got

1542
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,010
shot in the neck I stumbled out Let's

1543
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:25,009
Get Married you saved my life and she

1544
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:26,599
said no you owe me but yeah okay and

1545
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:29,690
then I said but we're gonna go to

1546
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:33,349
Anchorage in Alaska and so we ended up

1547
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:36,858
in Anchorage Alaska and I I had a law

1548
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:39,289
degree and I always had a hobby

1549
01:03:36,858 --> 01:03:43,539
gardening but when I got to Anchorage

1550
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:46,880
Alaska I was practicing law I discovered

1551
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:49,190
that the local newspapers were both

1552
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:53,150
published by different publishers and

1553
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:55,880
one of them was a but they were both

1554
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:57,470
printed by one publisher and distributed

1555
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,900
by one publisher he handled all the

1556
01:03:57,469 --> 01:04:02,750
advertising long story short we had a

1557
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:05,568
good paper and we had a really bad paper

1558
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:07,130
and in a place like Alaska where we were

1559
01:04:05,568 --> 01:04:10,039
getting all of our news two or three

1560
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:12,019
days late because we were so far away

1561
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:15,108
and they had to fly the videos up etc

1562
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:16,599
etc and no satellites back then you know

1563
01:04:15,108 --> 01:04:19,400
it was important to keep the newspaper

1564
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:21,349
alive and we did and I helped quite a

1565
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,849
bit and the publisher asked me what else

1566
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:25,010
I could do and I said I can write a

1567
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:28,640
garden column and so I started to write

1568
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:31,250
a garden column as a way to help this

1569
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:32,029
newspaper but also as a way to fulfill

1570
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:34,010
my fee

1571
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:37,910
the obligation to write a letter a week

1572
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:39,500
to my parents back in New York and my

1573
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:41,239
father's a big gardener and so I would

1574
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,190
always write about gardening and so the

1575
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:46,869
column who sort of became a letter home

1576
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:50,570
to my father and then it became a

1577
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:52,730
unbelievable legal tool I was an

1578
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:54,320
assistant attorney general I was going

1579
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:56,599
in and out of court on temporary

1580
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,750
restraining orders all the time I was

1581
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:02,809
doing a really high power oil and gas

1582
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:05,090
stuff involving Exxon and BP and so hyoe

1583
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:06,679
and you know all these big oil companies

1584
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:09,019
that deal up in Alaska I was

1585
01:05:06,679 --> 01:05:11,299
representing the state and I was I had

1586
01:05:09,019 --> 01:05:13,280
the ability to be able to go in and you

1587
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:15,500
know I needed to get a judge again on

1588
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,180
this calendar or her calendar you know

1589
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:20,210
and the secretary would always say oh

1590
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:21,559
before what am I to do about my African

1591
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:25,940
violet over here you know so it became a

1592
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:27,920
a really great legal tool and and I

1593
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:30,590
remember my first case in the Supreme

1594
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:33,320
Court of the state of Alaska against

1595
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:36,200
these oil companies sent their lawyers

1596
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:39,230
up from all over the really high power

1597
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:42,769
attorneys my first time in the Supreme

1598
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:46,369
Court and the first question mr. Lowe in

1599
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:50,150
Fell's my wife wants to know what does

1600
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:52,639
she do about and you could see the ex

1601
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:56,570
Secretary of Army who was representing

1602
01:05:52,639 --> 01:06:03,170
Exxon understand exactly what had just

1603
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:05,570
happened to him I was an assistant

1604
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:07,940
attorney general first for FiberNet for

1605
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:10,910
six years back in the day when Alaska

1606
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:13,760
didn't really have any Attorney

1607
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:17,149
General's and so I represented all sorts

1608
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,810
of terrific agencies ended up doing a

1609
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:22,910
tremendous amount of a private practice

1610
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:26,630
mining law oil and gas law environmental

1611
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:28,190
law and I had a client who was the

1612
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:31,190
governor of the state of Alaska named

1613
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:34,639
Wally Hickel who had a dream to build a

1614
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:37,550
gas pipeline that ran right along the

1615
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:39,500
oil pipeline that took the gas that was

1616
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:41,990
being produced with that oil but was

1617
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:44,510
being pumped back into the ground bring

1618
01:06:41,989 --> 01:06:45,919
it down to Valdez converted to liquefied

1619
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:49,099
natural gas and she

1620
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:51,650
to Japan Korea and Taiwan and solve our

1621
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:53,869
balance of payments with all of those

1622
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:55,608
companies the country's as well as

1623
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:57,740
stimulate the economy all around the

1624
01:06:55,608 --> 01:07:01,130
country so so I worked on that project

1625
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:04,239
for years and years and years it was

1626
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:07,369
purchased by a fortune 500 company I

1627
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:10,219
became the president of the company we

1628
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:12,019
permitted this unbelievable project even

1629
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:13,969
in the face of the Exxon Valdez oil

1630
01:07:12,019 --> 01:07:16,338
spill we had an environmental impact

1631
01:07:13,969 --> 01:07:18,529
statement that basically came out you

1632
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:21,170
know two months later in the same area

1633
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:22,700
we got all of the permits for a project

1634
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,619
that you've never heard of that was the

1635
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:28,098
world's largest construction project

1636
01:07:24,619 --> 01:07:30,890
that ended up for political reasons and

1637
01:07:28,099 --> 01:07:33,650
I contend some nefarious ones at that

1638
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:37,848
getting killed by the governor of the

1639
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:39,889
state of Alaska and and so at that point

1640
01:07:37,849 --> 01:07:43,309
in time I decided you know this legal

1641
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:44,960
stuff is is fun but it's it's it's time

1642
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,339
to do something else and so I went

1643
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,619
easily when you're doing the kind of law

1644
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:50,929
that you could turn the keys on your car

1645
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:53,568
and your car could explode yeah I was

1646
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:56,629
you know I worried about the oil

1647
01:07:53,568 --> 01:07:59,779
companies blowing up my car there was no

1648
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:04,030
question I would been told that I was

1649
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:06,019
extremely hated and feared you know by

1650
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:08,420
BP and some of these other oil companies

1651
01:08:06,019 --> 01:08:10,159
and well they should hate me and fear me

1652
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,990
because they they didn't treat Alaska

1653
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:13,519
well and they certainly didn't treat

1654
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:15,968
this project well but but in any case

1655
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:18,920
not to be too bitter about it all I

1656
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:20,600
during the ten year at the end of this

1657
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,630
project now you have to understand that

1658
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:27,310
any big project that involves natural

1659
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:30,440
resources in Alaska is a transportation

1660
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:33,170
play it all comes down to transportation

1661
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:34,969
we are so far away from everything we

1662
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,279
are closer to Tokyo than we are to

1663
01:08:34,969 --> 01:08:40,250
Washington DC that everything involves

1664
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,770
transportation and and the last couple

1665
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:45,619
of months of my career were this project

1666
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:49,100
a guy a truck driver walked into my

1667
01:08:45,619 --> 01:08:52,670
office and he said to me I've got this

1668
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:55,640
special soil that we got up here all

1669
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:57,949
over the place and and I want to get it

1670
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,599
down to the lower 48 states and it's a

1671
01:08:57,948 --> 01:09:01,250
transportation play

1672
01:08:59,599 --> 01:09:03,980
and you sure know an awful lot about it

1673
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:07,399
can you help me well lo and behold it

1674
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:10,399
turned out this soil was very special

1675
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:13,158
soil it had the highest microbiology

1676
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:16,420
that anybody had ever seen in soil and

1677
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:18,710
it was all over the state of Alaska and

1678
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:20,989
particularly all over the Anchorage area

1679
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:23,029
and it turns out to be the soil that

1680
01:09:20,988 --> 01:09:25,818
grew the big cabbages that everybody

1681
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:28,460
knows about so I got involved with it

1682
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:32,089
and through becoming involved with this

1683
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:34,338
guy in this truck driver I I met dr.

1684
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:37,309
Elaine Ingham I was introduced to the

1685
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:40,809
soil food web and when I went out from

1686
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:43,940
from the project and went into a

1687
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:46,750
practice representing Alaskan inventors

1688
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:50,419
I started to write teaming with microbes

1689
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:53,859
for regular gardeners because I felt

1690
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:57,859
that I had been so betrayed by the

1691
01:09:53,859 --> 01:10:00,319
gardening industry telling me I needed

1692
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:03,618
chemicals and I needed Miracle Grow and

1693
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:06,198
I needed you know we'd be gone on all

1694
01:10:03,618 --> 01:10:07,939
these terrible things when in fact it

1695
01:10:06,198 --> 01:10:11,229
was the soil food web that ran the

1696
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:14,448
system that there was that truck driver

1697
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:17,839
and then through Tom Alexander a mutual

1698
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:20,559
friend of ours mine who I want you to

1699
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:24,529
meet and who I dedicated this DIY

1700
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,389
autoflowering cannabis book to Wow I

1701
01:10:24,529 --> 01:10:28,908
just I just got so turned down by the

1702
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:32,118
soil food web that I wrote these soil

1703
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:34,848
food web books and and I wouldn't have

1704
01:10:32,118 --> 01:10:38,960
done it had I not been a lawyer and ran

1705
01:10:34,849 --> 01:10:40,310
into this fellow fascinating great a

1706
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,920
great way to pull it all together so

1707
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:45,860
before I let you go I do want to hit on

1708
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,199
one more growing related question and

1709
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:50,389
you know anybody who has emailed with

1710
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:52,969
you sees in your signature on all your

1711
01:10:50,389 --> 01:10:54,650
email it says plant a row for the hungry

1712
01:10:52,969 --> 01:10:56,448
and I know you're very passionate about

1713
01:10:54,649 --> 01:10:57,828
this program so why don't you tell us a

1714
01:10:56,448 --> 01:10:59,348
little bit to maybe inspire us and get

1715
01:10:57,828 --> 01:11:03,469
some some more people to participate

1716
01:10:59,349 --> 01:11:05,360
yeah it makes me cry you know but anyway

1717
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:08,569
so while I was working on this gigantic

1718
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:12,049
project I used to go to Asia once a

1719
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:13,488
month and Washington DC once a month and

1720
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,989
I was in Washington DC and

1721
01:11:13,488 --> 01:11:17,479
of course you would go to Washington DC

1722
01:11:14,988 --> 01:11:19,759
on a fortune 500 expense account you go

1723
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:21,288
first class so I flew first class I

1724
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,780
stayed at the first-class hotel the

1725
01:11:21,288 --> 01:11:25,880
Willard hotel and I ate first class that

1726
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:28,550
expense-account restaurants and I was

1727
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:31,010
there one week it was the coldest week

1728
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:33,679
they had ever experienced in Washington

1729
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:36,199
DC that gas was being shut off they

1730
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:38,960
closed the airport they shut down

1731
01:11:36,198 --> 01:11:42,408
Washington DC except for tourists who

1732
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,510
were stuck there and it was crazy

1733
01:11:42,408 --> 01:11:47,268
unbelievably cold and I remember going

1734
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:50,269
to my home of my hotel to a restaurant

1735
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:51,949
which was really glad to see me because

1736
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:55,130
there wasn't anybody else around that

1737
01:11:51,948 --> 01:11:58,158
was a very expensive restaurant having a

1738
01:11:55,130 --> 01:12:00,109
very expensive meal and leaving with my

1739
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:02,029
hands in my pockets because it was so

1740
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:04,429
cold with money wrapped around you know

1741
01:12:02,029 --> 01:12:07,368
in my hands and a guy came up to me and

1742
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:09,859
said I need some food can you give me

1743
01:12:07,368 --> 01:12:12,408
some money well in Washington DC there

1744
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:14,389
signs everywhere that they do not give

1745
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:17,569
money to panhandlers we have our own

1746
01:12:14,389 --> 01:12:19,969
system blablabla and so I refused to

1747
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:22,279
give the guy money I and he followed me

1748
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:26,090
and he said come with me watch me eat

1749
01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:28,518
and I still thinking of those signs did

1750
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:31,130
not help him I ended up at the Willard

1751
01:12:28,519 --> 01:12:32,599
hotel the doorman you know saw me coming

1752
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:35,480
with this guy following me he saw the

1753
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:37,670
doorman and he ran away I went to bed

1754
01:12:35,479 --> 01:12:39,549
that night in my hotel room which had

1755
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:43,819
not just a little little you know

1756
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:47,029
chocolate on the it had a fruit basket a

1757
01:12:43,819 --> 01:12:48,618
bottle of wine I had the worst night's

1758
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:52,429
sleep of my life

1759
01:12:48,618 --> 01:12:54,979
it was Scrooge I saw my parents you know

1760
01:12:52,429 --> 01:12:56,538
what did you do to that got you stiffed

1761
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:59,928
a guy who needed your help

1762
01:12:56,538 --> 01:13:01,550
that's not Malone fellows way and oh my

1763
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:03,710
god I woke up the next morning it was

1764
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:06,199
still freezing I look for the guy all

1765
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:07,849
over the place I had to take my plane

1766
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:10,129
home they finally opened the airport I

1767
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:12,800
got on the plight of flying first-class

1768
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:15,639
I'm flying over over your area Vashon

1769
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:20,300
Island you know having a great flight

1770
01:13:15,639 --> 01:13:22,819
drink I have a steak and zucchini and

1771
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:24,920
I'm looking down at it and I can't get

1772
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:27,198
this guy out of my mind and I think

1773
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,440
about the zucchini and the joke that if

1774
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:30,019
you

1775
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,389
in Wisconsin and and you park your car

1776
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:34,790
at night you always make sure you lock

1777
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:36,289
it because if you don't when you get in

1778
01:13:34,789 --> 01:13:38,750
the car the next morning it's full of

1779
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:42,350
someone's zucchini you know it's so hard

1780
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:43,969
to give away and I said she's I you know

1781
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:46,160
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get

1782
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:49,189
everybody in Anchorage to help us wash

1783
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:52,250
my bad conscience for sniffing this guy

1784
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:54,379
I can still see his face today for

1785
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:56,779
sniffing this guy I'm gonna get

1786
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:59,270
everybody to donate one row on their

1787
01:13:56,779 --> 01:14:01,340
garden through my garden column to

1788
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:03,500
what's known as beans cafe our soup

1789
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:05,840
kitchen up here and it was a very

1790
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,100
successful program and it helped me feel

1791
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,529
a little bit better I only had the

1792
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:13,850
nightmare once a month you know I only

1793
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:16,759
heard my father you know you know once a

1794
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:18,710
month and and and then one day the

1795
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,900
Garden Writers of America came came to

1796
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:23,180
Alaska for a convention they heard about

1797
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:25,969
the program they visited beans cafe and

1798
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:30,789
we adopted it as a national program and

1799
01:14:25,969 --> 01:14:33,920
it exists still today we resupply tunned

1800
01:14:30,789 --> 01:14:37,819
hard tens and hundreds of tons of food a

1801
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:41,239
year to supply the soup kitchens to

1802
01:14:37,819 --> 01:14:43,460
synagogues churches you know food banks

1803
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:46,639
any place that will take food the

1804
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:49,340
gardener grows it the gardener harvests

1805
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:51,170
it the gardener takes it in nothing

1806
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:53,960
slips between the lip and cup in terms

1807
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:56,329
of money no administrative costs no you

1808
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:59,210
know you know how to support anybody the

1809
01:14:56,329 --> 01:15:02,630
it's plant a role for the hungry and I

1810
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:05,029
encourage everybody to plant one role in

1811
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:07,190
their garden to feed the hungry and if

1812
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:09,109
you're growing only cannabis then some

1813
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:11,509
of your cannabis ought to go to a vet or

1814
01:15:09,109 --> 01:15:15,469
somebody that needs medical cannabis

1815
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:17,420
because gardeners share and that's the

1816
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:20,359
best way we can possibly do it we have

1817
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:24,109
30 some-odd million people going to bed

1818
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:27,439
every night hungry in the United States

1819
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:30,649
of America unconscionable just just

1820
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:32,448
incredible and then you know you go out

1821
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:34,519
of your garden and - an island and you

1822
01:15:32,448 --> 01:15:36,619
look at somebody who's left broccoli

1823
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,570
there or left lettuce because they're

1824
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:41,569
sick and sick of it after that you know

1825
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:44,359
no you take it to somebody that knee

1826
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:46,549
this is has to be the basis of how we

1827
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:47,809
live so there I am

1828
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:49,430
you can hardly shut me up about it

1829
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,990
that's beautiful Jeff thank you very

1830
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:54,200

1831
01:15:50,989 --> 01:15:56,000
story yeah so with that it is time for

1832
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:58,840
us to wrap up thank you so much for

1833
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,850

1835

that comes out today and links will be

1837

provided for that everywhere the podcast

1838
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:14,659
is but just thank you for sharing your

1839
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:17,059
good share and your joy and your

1840
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:19,159
experience and being well willing to put

1841
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:21,890
it all on the line with us well you know

1842
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:24,710
I I always appreciate your show and you

1843
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:28,220
know now I got this book published it's

1844
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:30,050
time to get to work on the next one do

1845
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:33,079
you are you ready to share with us a

1846
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:34,730
topic yet well I will share with you the

1847
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:37,489
topic but I but I will tell you my

1848
01:16:34,729 --> 01:16:40,369
criteria and this one will be part of

1849
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:43,309
the teaming series I hope the publisher

1850
01:16:40,369 --> 01:16:46,340
takes it but my criteria is it has to be

1851
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:48,410
something that's usable by the gardener

1852
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,610
you know and I don't mean just

1853
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:51,139
scientific information that's

1854
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:54,439
interesting I mean something that they

1855
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:57,260
can actually employ in growing plants

1856
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:59,509
that'll make them a better gardener that

1857
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:02,239
they're not aware of and they're not

1858
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:03,920
using today I think I've got something

1859
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:06,380
right on well we will certainly be

1860
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,730
excited to check that out when it comes

1861
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:10,039
out and I know everybody's going to be

1862
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:11,989
excited to have another teaming with

1863
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:15,010
book and I'll have to like retrain

1864
01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:17,090
myself to no longer call it a trilogy

1865
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:21,440

1866
