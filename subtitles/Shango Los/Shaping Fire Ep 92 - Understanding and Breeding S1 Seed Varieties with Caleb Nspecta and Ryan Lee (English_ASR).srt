2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,759
people grow cannabis for all sorts of

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,759
reasons and in all sorts of different

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,199
ways most licensed commercial outfits

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,839
are looking for consistency where every

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,439
seed expresses itself in the same way

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,399
many hom Growers are looking for that

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,960
too but also most cannabis breeders and

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:30,239
many homeg Growers pop cannabis seeds to

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,320
find variety atypical plant morphology

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,320
and rare expressions of cannabis plants

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,039
in our complex cannabis scene some are

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
trying to Sif align down to one plant

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,079
type while other folks are trying to

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,960
open up the wild cannabis genome to find

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,039
the outer edges both are fabulous and

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,920
important it is the

18
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:54,800
way today's episode sits in the middle

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,359
of these two worlds S1 seed types are

20
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,518
about catching the lightning in the

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,960
bottle for one popular plant variety but

22
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,679

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,640
feminized cannabis seeds today we're

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,959
going to talk about S1 seeds what they

98
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,279
are their advantages and challenges and

99
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,560
a bit on how to make them welcome to the

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,479
show

101
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,120
fellas good to be here thanks for having

102
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,639
us right on so let's get right into it

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,438
let's start by digging into what an S1

104
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,519
is to get us all on the same page um

105
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,839
let's start with you Ryan how about you

106
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,800
give us an explanation from the

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:29,359
scientific perspective of what an S1

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,840
is okay so an S1 is really a designation

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,280
or label that we give to a generation of

110
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:40,519
plants um S1 seeds come from the mating

111
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:43,038
of one particular plant to itself and

112
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:46,560
the resulting generation of seeds is

113
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:48,759
what we called S1 or self one

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,879
generation um so that's

115
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,919
really that that's really what we mean

116
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,839
when we say s1s we're referring to a

117
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,478
population that is created through

118
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,959
mating one particular plant to itself

119
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,360
with no outside

120
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,038
influence so when we say maing it to

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,319
itself um we're talking about like

122
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,918
female only breeding where we're going

123
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:19,120
to cause male flowers on that same plant

124
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:22,079
and so um it is self-pollinating

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,639
yeah yeah we we create a self

126
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,800
fertilization event as you know I I

127
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
think people are probably going to want

128
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,439
to go back and listen to the other um

129
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,639
episode that we did on ones to kind of

130
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:36,079
get a bit of a basis

131
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,960
um there's different ways to do it

132
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,359
sometimes you'll take two cuting of the

133
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:43,359
same plant and one plant will be treated

134
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,759
with a hormone blocker to induce male

135
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,240
flowers on otherwise female plant um and

136
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,600
so we actually have

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,840
two two individual specimens but

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,759
genetically they're the same plant one

139
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,119
of them we treat with a hormone a

140
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,160
recipe that induces the formation of

141
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,639
male flow flowers on that particular

142
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,280
female genetic plant and those those

143
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,038
male flowers are able to produce pollen

144
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:11,839
and then we use the pollen from that

145
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:15,598
plant to transfer to the female version

146
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:17,079
of that same clone the the untreated

147
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,560
version the plant that we didn't put any

148
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,560
hormones on it will naturally develop

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,160
female flowers and when we bring the

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,598
pollen from the male version of that

151
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,080
plant or the male the staminate version

152
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,439
I guess we should call it of that plant

153
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,359
and we fertilize the pistol version we

154
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,160
end up with a generation of seed that is

155
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,639
created only from the genetic type of

156
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,919
that one

157
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,280
individual right on so um we will talk

158
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,758
more about the attributes of these S1

159
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:49,239
seeds in a moment but Caleb um another

160
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,840
way to focus on what is an S1 other than

161
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,960
just talking about it from a genetic

162
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,119
perspective is to focus on why we bother

163
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,918
to make them and um you know you're the

164
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,160
most prolific maker of s1s that I'm

165
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:07,038
aware of in the Cannabis scene um why do

166
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,919
you make s1s why are these attracted

167
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,240
attractive to you to produce and share

168
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:15,680
with the

169
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:19,639
community I think first uh is

170
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,560
Preservation I mean it's uh it's

171
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,680
difficult keeping you know clones alive

172
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
for years and years and years I mean you

173
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,079
know I've had clones for certain

174
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,800
individuals for over 20 years but but

175
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,318
you know I mean it's it's not fun taking

176
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,960
care of a huge library of clones

177
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,919
especially for that long and so

178
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:45,719
preservation is you know always uh the

179
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:50,478
the main target um and then

180
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:55,080
uh basically uh breeding stock um I

181
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:57,680
personally like to breed with S1

182
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,158
selections um and then you know move on

183
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,560
to S2s etc etc

184
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:05,680
but you know you can you can really

185
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,319
narrow down certain traits by utilizing

186
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,759
the S1

187
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,240
seeds um to you know make new more

188
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,158
stable

189
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,720
hybrids so that's a probably the two

190
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:23,038
main reasons that I like to create them

191
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,319
you know being one of the few folks who

192
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:31,279
are who are putting s1s especially s1's

193
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:34,240
often into the the market um I can

194
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:38,038
imagine that you're used to answering

195
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,200
the question like what's an S1 cuz cuz

196
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,319
most seed buyers are comfortable with

197
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,879
seeing F1 F2 F3 e even if they might not

198
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,360
be f3s um you know people people are at

199
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:53,320
least aware of that that um you know

200
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,080
that notation but s1's is is still

201
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,278
pretty unfamiliar to most folks when you

202
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,959
um you know when you are at a table or

203
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,919
when when you were explaining it to

204
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:06,239
somebody do you find that people are

205
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,879
skittish of it just because it's got an

206
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,120
atypical notation or um or do you find

207
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:16,519
that people are pretty pretty easy to

208
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,240
you know just pick up s1's because they

209
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,078
like the the description of the

210
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,480
Cross well I think this is a a topic

211
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:27,000
we'll be getting to

212
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,680
here um

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,078
shortly uh a lot of people you know of

214
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:36,519
course think an S1 you know is is more

215
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:38,479
or less the same as you know the plant

216
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,278
it's coming from but uh we'll we'll

217
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,159
touch on that I'm sure in a little bit

218
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:49,879
um so people tend to want those s1's

219
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:54,439
over hybrids because they're looking for

220
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:56,360
a pure you know representation of you

221
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,920
know the cut they're getting and that's

222
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,800
not always the case of you know what

223
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:05,479
they're going to get from

224
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,359
s1's so it sounds like the people who

225
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,159
come to you and they're holding these

226
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,720
seeds they pretty much fall into two

227
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:14,879
categories people who know what s1's are

228
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,399
are excited to get them because they're

229
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,958
special and they they put breeding power

230
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,440
in their hands and then people who don't

231
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:26,518
know what s1's are that may be a little

232
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,360
more unsure because they want seeds that

233
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,679
are going to work for them and they only

234
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,240
know what f1s are so so there's a

235
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:36,479
certain amount of uh I don't know coner

236
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Services you need to provide them once

237
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,639
you figure out what kind of a you know

238
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,799
cultivator they are right right I I I

239
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:49,720
think most most of the people who you

240
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:51,879
know come come to me already have a

241
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,920
fairly decent idea of what they're

242
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:58,720
looking for what they're trying to get

243
00:10:53,919 --> 00:11:01,078
not all but definitely most it seems mhm

244
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,879
so we have a can I if I can just jump in

245
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,278
here I think we have a real interesting

246
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,600
thing in the cannabis seed Market you

247
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:11,159
know when you go and buy flower seeds or

248
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,720
uh vegetable seeds you can expect that

249
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,000
you're buying the seeds and they when

250
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,200
you grow them they're all going to look

251
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,759
the same and they're all going to look

252
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,920
like the plant on the front of the

253
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,200
package um and that just doesn't happen

254
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,919
in cannabis partly because of the the

255
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,120
history of hybridization that we've

256
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,799
really gone through in the past 30 40

257
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,078
years with this plant

258
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,639
but also partly because of the plant's

259
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,278
natural mating cycle you know I I I get

260
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,680
people to kind of understand I try to

261
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,439
get people to understand that cannabis

262
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:43,199
is very The Mating system of cannabis is

263
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,880
very much like the mating system of

264
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,560
humans okay and so if you look at any

265
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:52,679
given Human family you have a male that

266
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,958
that has um sexual relations with a with

267
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,838
a female and that creates a generation

268
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,679
of Offspring now if you look around the

269
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,880
world and we we look look at this

270
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,078
practice all over the world we are

271
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,399
pretty sure you know we we we can

272
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,000
understand pretty conclusively that the

273
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,958
family that's created from the mom and

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
the dad might look like the mom and the

275
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:16,879
dad but they're not reproductions of

276
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:20,240
either the mom or the dad right and and

277
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,120
so when we compare that practice to the

278
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,399
way that we you know breed plants for

279
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,759
agriculture the expectation is when you

280
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,278
cross two plants together that all of

281
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:30,439
the plants will come up looking the same

282
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:31,799
right and so I think that there's a lot

283
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,880
of confusion in this well I know there's

284
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,599
a lot of confusion in the seed Market

285
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,639
and there's a certain percentage of

286
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,600
people that even if they understand that

287
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:43,680
an S1 is the product of one clone self

288
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,240
ferti or self- fertilizing and producing

289
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:49,958
seeds people

290
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,560
believe that by crossing the same clone

291
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,479
to itself that all of the plants are

292
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,679
going to end up looking like that same

293
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,278
plant that same clone and that's just

294
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,239
completely wrong that's a total fallacy

295
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:03,039
and so if if you're buying you know

296
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,320
Legend OG seeds from Caleb and you think

297
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,759
that all the plants are going to end up

298
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,519
looking and smelling like the legend OG

299
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,679
you're really mistaken right and so when

300
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,360
we talk about when Caleb talks about

301
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:17,519
preservation I think it's important to

302
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,000
clarify that when you breed when you

303
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,159
when you create an S1 seed yes the

304
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,078
entire generation as a collection has

305
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,799
all of the traits within that generation

306
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:33,319
that were present in the parent plant

307
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:36,319
but the individual plants in that

308
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,920
population may or may not have that tra

309
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,879
those traits um and that's just a simple

310
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,479
reality of the way that meiosis and

311
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,559
recombination Works you're you're not

312
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,079
always going to get all the traits when

313
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,799
we have we have traits that um so this

314
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,078
is what's called a segregating

315
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,319
generation and people can look that up

316
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,519
but a segregating generation is

317
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,360
essentially a generation of plant

318
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,000
breeding where traits recombine with

319
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,919
each other and I think the expectation

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,919
of a lot of people is that when they see

321
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,479
seeds that come from a plant that look

322
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:14,599
like o a legend sorry Legend OG that all

323
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,159
of the plants will be clones of that

324
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,079
Legend OG plant um and so if you're

325
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:24,399
buying say uh I don't know the package

326
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:27,039
size that Caleb sells his s1's in but if

327
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,198
you're buying you know seeds of say five

328
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,879
S1 seeds and you're expecting to see

329
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,639
plant that looks like the

330
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,159
parent in all ways you're probably going

331
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,879
to be Miss you're you're probably not

332
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,879
going to find what you're looking

333
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,838
for

334
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,480
um so yeah I think I'll leave it at

335
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,279
there and we can expand on that as we go

336
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:51,240
through right on so um uh uh we're going

337
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:53,278
to talk more about those attributes of

338
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,440
S1 seeds in just a moment but I'm I I

339
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,000
want to do it now but I'm not going to

340
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,720
take that bait because I want to ask

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,399
about what you said at the beginning of

342
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,560
of the this where you were comparing S1

343
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,278
seeds and the expectations of Growers um

344
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,919
to the uh you know to the commercial

345
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,720
ornamental agriculture market and I'm

346
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,198
curious um you know there there are so

347
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,680
many expectations and and even

348
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:23,838
vocabulary that we use in the Cannabis

349
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:26,439
scene that seems absurd to the more uh

350
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,399
formalized and established agriculture

351
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,800
Market does the rest of the a market use

352
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,559
S1 seeds or are those so

353
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:38,958
R&amp;D that those are kind of like a middle

354
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,399
step before you get to the seeds that

355
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:44,278
you release to the public in the regular

356
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,078
egg market like like are we people in

357
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:48,838
cannabis some of the only folks that are

358
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,838
messing around with S1 seeds at the

359
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,519
retail

360
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:57,079
level Ryan it's an interest it's an

361
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,440
interesting question and I not knowing

362
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:01,399
enough of the other the way other plants

363
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,480
operate or the markets for other plant

364
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,240
plants operate I can't really answer

365
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,920
conclusively I can tell you for sure

366
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,560
like in the agricultural Market if

367
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,958
you're buying like tomato seed or like

368
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,078
Rye or wheat or like some type of grain

369
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,719
that you're planting by the Thousand

370
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,159
Acres they're not producing them by self

371
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,240
seed in that case the self seed is more

372
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,360
of a a step um like a breeding step that

373
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,759
probably wouldn't be released

374
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,240
commercially but you know kind of

375
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,480
touching upon what we had just said

376
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,120
about you know selling five packs or 10

377
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,120
packs of S1

378
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,600
seed I really see Caleb doing something

379
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,120
as a service to the to the

380
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,079
industry I personally don't consider S1

381
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,278
seeds or the production of L S1 seeds as

382
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:50,120
like a real breeding project that that

383
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:52,879
we would that like a a plant breeder

384
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,959
would necessarily take a huge amount of

385
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,559
pride in like in a lot of cases what

386
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,399
we're doing is getting a plant from the

387
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,198
marketplace or a a plant

388
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,318
that the community has decided is

389
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,199
valuable and you know that happens as

390
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,599
these the elite clones called them

391
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,480
raised like they kind of they're kind of

392
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,480
like the the cream of the crop right

393
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,160
like everybody has say 10 really great

394
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,599
plants but the best ones get shared and

395
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,038
then when they get shared and shared

396
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,318
again the ones that remain and continue

397
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,480
to be shared are really the best of the

398
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,000
best right and so if Caleb acquires one

399
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,959
of those plants and he decides to make

400
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,880
S1 seeds he's really not doing a lot of

401
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,200
actual breeding work but he's providing

402
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,280
a service to the community in allowing

403
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,840
the reproduction and and like he said

404
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,200
the preservation of that plant in a seed

405
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:43,918
form now I would

406
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,880
argue you know at again like at five

407
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,480
seeds in a pack you're not really doing

408
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,520
a huge service to the community but I

409
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,679
also think that like if if someone is

410
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,639
really serious about a seed line and

411
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,159
they truly want to like say I want to

412
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,360
say I don't have Legend seed in my in my

413
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,120
stable and I want want to buy Legend OG

414
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,558
seeds from Caleb or some other self that

415
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,399
he's created that I don't have in my

416
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:09,359
stable personally When I Grow self seeds

417
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,720
I really don't look at like less than 50

418
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:15,240
um because like I said the the traits

419
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,319
that we see in the parents in some

420
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,279
plants they disappear in kind of like an

421
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:22,678
either or fashion and and you might have

422
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,399
a valuable trait in one of The Offspring

423
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,919
but it might be missing another valuable

424
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,080
trait so for example let's talk again

425
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,280
Legend OG Legend OG has got it's a

426
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:34,359
hybrid of two plants it's got a

427
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,798
relatively interesting scent profile on

428
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,839
one side of the parentage and that that

429
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,879
scent is dominant but the other side of

430
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,240
the parentage contributed like a not

431
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,840
very desirable smell so when you when

432
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,120
you Shuffle those jeans and you grow it

433
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,720
the Next

434
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,038
Generation 75% of them are going to have

435
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,558
the trait that you want that that

436
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:57,119
delicious smell but 25% of the plants

437
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,000
are not going to have that um and that's

438
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,279
we've only looked at one trait right and

439
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,798
so when we factor in like say let's say

440
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,759
that there's a yield characteristic or

441
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,400
uh a powdery Meer resistance

442
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,960
characteristic that is recessive and it

443
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,880
only occurs in

444
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,840
25% of the plants when when it's sprad

445
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,720
so now you have to multiply that 25%

446
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:23,558
probability by the 75% of the plants

447
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,440
that have the smell profile and you can

448
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:27,279
see that out of like you know those four

449
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,558
plants that we already started with

450
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,798
we're already down to like one potential

451
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:34,119
plant out of four that is going to have

452
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,519
the two traits that we're really looking

453
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:41,158
at that we're really interested in

454
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:44,480
following or breeding for um and so like

455
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:47,360
part of the S1 growing process is

456
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,839
really like you said Shang Shango it's

457
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,959
this is part of the work that's done

458
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,839
behind the scenes and really doesn't

459
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,720
usually make it to the market in other

460
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:57,000
crop

461
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,720
species um because it's really like

462
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,119
we're kind of working out the traits and

463
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,679
trying to get them all aligned in a way

464
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,199
that when we release them to the public

465
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,919
the public gets exactly what they want

466
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,200
and so you know my argument is that

467
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,640
Caleb's really doing a service to the

468
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,960
community by taking some of these held

469
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,840
tightly held plants making segregating

470
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,000
generations of the genetics in those

471
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,038
plants in other words making self seeds

472
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,519
from those plants and then sharing those

473
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:29,158
far and wide right because that kind of

474
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:32,240
democratizes the breeding process and

475
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,880
opens up I would say kind of the some of

476
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,839
the elite germ plasm that exist in the

477
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,360
species and it distributes it around the

478
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:43,798
community and I think that that's

479
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,558
probably um quite a different mentality

480
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,000
that that happens in other in other crop

481
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:51,000
species so you know I look at self self

482
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,480
selling self seeds as both as the same

483
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,679
same thing you're kind of get you're

484
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,200
kind of selling seeds that are like a

485
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,000
relatively high dollar

486
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,798
value um but it didn't have a ton of

487
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,279
work that went into it but on the flip

488
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,200
side you're really offering something to

489
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,639
the community that they couldn't get

490
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,558
elsewhere um and so I think that it's

491
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,278
fair that if somebody really wanted to

492
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,240
work a seed line and say Caleb is

493
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,240
selling 10 seeds for a 100 bucks you

494
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,798
know if you want to grow 50 seeds I I

495
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,679
would come and buy five packs of those

496
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,480
seeds and grow them all together right

497
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,679
because then then like we were talking

498
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:30,400
about that preservation step that exists

499
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:34,159
within the entire S1 population you have

500
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,320
like a relatively decent Siz snapshot of

501
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,640
of that variation within 50 seeds better

502
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,918
if you have 100 seeds but 50 is

503
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,520
certainly much much better than five

504
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,679
seeds right um so a little bit rambly

505
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,639
but I don't know if that that no not not

506
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,960
rambly at all and I actually really like

507
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,480
what you said about the democratization

508
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:59,159
of of these germ plasms these genetics

509
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,360
um because it is true like nobody can

510
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,840
argue that Caleb has got

511
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:07,439
plants that um have been desired by

512
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:09,038
breeders for years and uh I'll probably

513
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
misquote you Caleb so I'm sorry in

514
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,558
advance but um like I you know I've

515
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,919
heard you talk on uh the last time you

516
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,798
were on shaping fire U I believe you

517
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,600
were talking about the U old family

518
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,519
purple cush that has been in your family

519
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,719
for I think we could actually literally

520
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:30,879
say Generations um and and that it's

521
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:34,120
like this old particular Purple Kush cut

522
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,240
that you know has these attributes that

523
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:40,479
people have you know not only loved as

524
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:44,159
far as a flower that people wanted to to

525
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,720
smoke but also it had attributes that

526
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:52,799
people wanted to use as um you know

527
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:55,440
solid breeding stock and you know almost

528
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,798
nobody has set up a situation where you

529
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,720
have where you're able to keep such a

530
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:02,720
library

531
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,200
and you know there are all sorts of uh

532
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,880
new breeders and hell even old breeders

533
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,640
that just don't have really awesome

534
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,120
access to genetics who are all like I

535
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,679
want I want to grow the I want to breed

536
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,759
the best thing that I can breed too you

537
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,798
know I would love to get my you know

538
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:24,278
hands on you know 25 30y old or longer

539
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:27,558
Purple Kush so that I can you know breed

540
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:30,079
it to the cool thing that I've made and

541
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:32,879
and you're taking the care to actually

542
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,278
you know um uh you know like kind of

543
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,278
like an archivist to you know make it

544
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,640
into seeds capture the variety of the

545
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:42,558
genetics and then put it out there so so

546
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,159
all that up sets sets up for this

547
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:49,839
question for you Caleb is that you know

548
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:53,240
what um what uh Ryan suggested that you

549
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:56,359
know you're doing a lot more

550
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,240
archiving than breeding and I kind of

551
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:00,599
thought in my head I'm like I'm I bet

552
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,440
you there's a lot of selection in there

553
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,879
that you're not actually trying to add

554
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,558
anything to it but maybe you're you're

555
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,880
selecting which plants to run with so so

556
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,319
I'm going to kind of I'm going to kind

557
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,960
of put this together in one messy

558
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:18,000
question and just drop it on your lap

559
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:20,480
dude which is um you know how do you see

560
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,119
the the work that that you're doing in

561
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,798
s1's like this like how much of it is

562
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,918
you found this particular cut in the

563
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:32,000
scene and you know you verified it

564
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,038
and you want to capture its potential

565
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,119
for a lot of people and therefore you

566
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:41,278
make the

567
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:43,759
s1's or are you um actually uh you know

568
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,278
like um I'll just say forbidden fruit I

569
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,359
don't know if this is true or not but

570
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,480
it's just what I'm going to use for the

571
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:52,839
example where like maybe you found a few

572
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,519
forbidden fruits that you liked and then

573
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:59,000
and then back cross them into each other

574
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:04,398
to kind of make a you know a a CSI

575
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
humble version of um forbidden fruit and

576
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:09,599
then and then you're making that an S1

577
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,640
because in your mind it is a perfected

578
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:16,319
forbidden fruit so that my friend is my

579
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,600
messy question well first off I I

580
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:22,558
definitely 100% agree with Ryan um I've

581
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:26,439
always looked at making

582
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:29,519
SES as as far as the the retail level

583
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,240
goes as just a service I don't pretend

584
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:35,079
I'm any kind of breeder on that it's

585
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,038
just providing a service now

586
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:41,879
realistically I make the s1's for me I I

587
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,038
make them one to preserve you know make

588
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,720
sure you have something in the fridge

589
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:50,759
freezer you know for a later date um but

590
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,720
also you know uh the s1's to me are a

591
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:58,599
first step uh in any type of you know

592
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:03,200
feminized breeding pro project program

593
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:06,158
for me and you know breeding or making

594
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,278
s1's isn't you know like Ryan said it's

595
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:14,159
not breeding it's just you know making

596
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:16,440
that first step and what what I like to

597
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,600
do you know past s ones is you know like

598
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:23,000
he said you know I I want to grow out at

599
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,639
least a hundred of them if I can and

600
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,599
select my favorites out of there and

601
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,960
then I can go a bunch of different ways

602
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:32,918
I can make pure s where I select one cut

603
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,960
and pollinate it you know with itself or

604
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:39,759
I can take you know a couple few

605
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:42,679
different sister cuts and uh you know um

606
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,798
cross them together I can always back

607
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,600
cross to the

608
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:50,679
mom but with some of those S ones but in

609
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:54,439
my experience um I don't think that

610
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:58,640
really produces what I'm you know

611
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:01,240
genuinely looking for um so and and then

612
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,799
that ties kind of into that you know for

613
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,558
forbidden fruit example you know you you

614
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,599
made I could you know make S ones of

615
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,918
forbidden fruit I could grow out a

616
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:13,119
hundred of them pick my favorites breed

617
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,600
them together this way that way the

618
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:18,558
other and make something that's no

619
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:23,480
longer just you know the forbidden fruit

620
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:25,960
it's you know my bread selected you know

621
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,440
my my version of forbidden fruit you

622
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,919
know and s1's are so variable that you

623
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,159
you you can give it to you know a dozen

624
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,159
different breeders and each one will end

625
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:42,760
up with a different you know a different

626
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:45,600
thing at the finish line so um I'm not

627
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:47,558
sure if that that touched yeah entirely

628
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,480
it did and I'd like you to take it a

629
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:51,079
step further I'm taking a little guess

630
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,240
that this is of the same variety but

631
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,918
would you tell the story of lemon tree

632
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,798
lemon party

633
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:03,759
oh well okay so

634
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:05,359
um I originally got uh a lemon tree cut

635
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:09,200
and I grew it out and I was like you

636
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:12,359
know I don't think this is lemon tree so

637
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,480
I did a bit of research on it

638
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:19,439
and I found out that it had zero the

639
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,839
attributes of well not zero I won't say

640
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,399
zero because it had that you know

641
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,079
extremely pungent lemon tree type smell

642
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:30,439
but the plant didn't grow anything like

643
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:34,079
lemon tree and and so um I kind of

644
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,720
Tracked Down uh what that cut was and

645
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:40,079
then I also Tracked Down uh the original

646
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,839
lemon tree cut and so I acquired the

647
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,439
lemon tree cut and grew it out and yeah

648
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,199
it's a completely different plant so I

649
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,558
had this

650
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,480
original uh the the first lemon tree cut

651
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:54,918
I had

652
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,120
gotten but you you don't want to call it

653
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:01,278
a lemon tree cuz it's not the lemon tree

654
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:04,959
tree so you know we we kind of changed

655
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:07,079
its name to Lemon Party um you know it

656
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,640
because on its own it's a it's a good

657
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:13,918
cut and um I always kind of looked at it

658
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,038
as a hybrid of lemon

659
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:21,799
tree but it could be either an S1 of

660
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:23,480
lemon tree um or or a hybrid so um right

661
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:24,599
on that is not at all the story that I

662
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,960
thought it was going to be but I'm glad

663
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,480
I asked you anyway because it was still

664
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,000
a good story but that I thought it was

665
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,079
going to be an S1 story but um it is is

666
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,640
more like receiving a cut and it's it's

667
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,519
not the one you thought it was you know

668
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,759
this is probably a good place to ask you

669
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:42,599
uh Caleb you know I know that you are

670
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:45,720
hardcore into searching out the actual

671
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:48,038
cut right um you know making sure that

672
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,880
that you've got a verified lineage

673
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:52,519
accurate cut is is an of an ultimate

674
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,799
priority to you and which makes sense

675
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:56,919
since you are a bit of an archivist and

676
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,918
you want to preserve these particular

677
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:02,600
things um

678
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:06,038
uh I can imagine that you run into times

679
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:08,519
like you just described where you really

680
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,839
want it to be the right cut the person

681
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,278
told you it was the right cut the

682
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,519
evidence is looking like it very well

683
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,960
could be the right cut but then when you

684
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,759
grow it it ain't the right cut and like

685
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,679
kind of like how do you struggle with

686
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,240
that to like know if you want to go

687
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:29,600
forward with this being the cut or not

688
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:32,399
right right I I mean I always try to get

689
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:35,439
you know Cuts as close to the original

690
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,599
source as I can um if not just the

691
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,278
original

692
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:44,119
Source

693
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:48,519
um but yeah uh if if you can't then yeah

694
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:50,918
uh it gets a little tricky sometimes uh

695
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,000
and uh go ahead oh I was just going to

696
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,320
say just with you know like with the

697
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,798
lemon party um if the cut you know

698
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:03,278
stands alone and on its own merits then

699
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:08,240
then definitely worth caping you know

700
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:11,240
but if it doesn't and it doesn't well it

701
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,278
doesn't line up with what the cut is or

702
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,798
should be that you were looking for yeah

703
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:18,919
those kind of need to just get filtered

704
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:21,798
out of the Jean Pool yeah right on um

705
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:25,840
you know do you when you go to original

706
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:28,200
sources for these Cuts do you find that

707
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:31,240
like you know you've been doing this

708
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:35,399
long enough you're OG enough people know

709
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,319
you enough where um the sources of the

710
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,119
cut like the the original breeder or

711
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,720
finder depending on the nature of the

712
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,879
cut that they're all like oh yeah man

713
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,798
like I'm happy to provide it to you so

714
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:50,399
you know it's the actual thing or do you

715
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:52,519
find that like people really want to

716
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,119
hold that more often than not and

717
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,759
they're happy that people are selling

718
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:58,518
cuts that aren't actually the right

719
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:03,919
thing because it creates artificial

720
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:06,440
um um scarcity for their original cut or

721
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,038
do you just have so much kickass stuff

722
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,759
to trade that you always have something

723
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:15,480
they want and people always give up the

724
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:18,278
cut I think you could say all the above

725
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,839
because no two no two scenarios are the

726
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:23,519
same um so pretty much every every

727
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:26,480
different scenario you described uh yeah

728
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:31,278
yeah there's definitely ones that can

729
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:35,599
fall into each one um you know uh I I

730
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:38,079
I'm I'm not a big fan of uh you know the

731
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:41,719
the the scarcity one where people start

732
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:44,038
trading one cut uh even though it's not

733
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:48,798
the right cut you know or the original

734
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:50,759
cut as the same type of name I mean uh a

735
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:52,759
perfect well not a perfect example but

736
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:56,839
an example like there was originally a

737
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:59,319
wedding cake around the Bay Area and you

738
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:01,439
know it circulated for couple few years

739
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:05,319
whatever and

740
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,720
then uh the jungle boys ran some of you

741
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:10,119
know just

742
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,720
blazing's uh hybrid I think it was the

743
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:16,719
kushman or something like that uh and

744
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,319
they named their keeper cut wedding cake

745
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,880
and so this cut of wedding cake that had

746
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:26,439
circulated the Bay Area and Beyond you

747
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,519
know all of a sudden it's not the

748
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,960
popular wedding cake because

749
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,839
you know the the wedding cake from the

750
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,600
jungle boys and jbzy you know got

751
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,959
circulated in mass and now all of a

752
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,879
sudden that's the most popular wedding

753
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,880
cake and it's not even the original

754
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,919
wedding cake so what do you do in that

755
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,720
kind of scenario where you've had

756
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,880
wedding cake for you know 10 or 12 years

757
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:56,200
and yet there's a brand new wedding cake

758
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,200
that's not even the same cake you know

759
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,480
yeah it's really strange in that case

760
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,120
the influence of the marketing aspect on

761
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,839
on how the lineage will be taught you

762
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,519
know what do they say the the winners

763
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:13,759
write the history right and and it's

764
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:18,759
kind of like that oh yeah big time yeah

765
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:21,000
so so Ryan I want to um uh talk about

766
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,079
the inherent weaknesses that there may

767
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,239
be an s1s right before we go to break

768
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,280
here and when we come back for set two

769
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:34,398
we're going to we're going to go more in

770
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:37,560
depth into the uh genetic variety that's

771
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:41,358
held within a group of S1 seeds I am

772
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:43,838
more focused on like as a breeder or as

773
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,598
a grower are there any inherent

774
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:50,878
weaknesses to

775
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,720
s1's um that makes them uh less than

776
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,480
desirable and it could just be that the

777
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,039
answer is no cuz we'll we we'll talk

778
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,119
more about um inter sexies and and

779
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:02,440
things like that in the second set but

780
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,079
are there any um you know since since

781
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,679
this first set is kind of like getting

782
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:11,880
people familiar with s1s are there any

783
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:14,118
immediately red red flags to s1s that

784
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,200
you would that you would flag as a

785
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,640
geneticist because mostly what we've

786
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,480
said so far are that s1's are pretty

787
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:25,480
kickass and they meet a very particular

788
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,358
need of breeders and then you know nerdy

789
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,000
people like me that just like to see

790
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:32,159
different expressions of a plant but but

791
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,519
you are uniquely aware of what's under

792
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:37,480
the hood of an S1 and and if there's any

793
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,199
if there's anything we want to say that

794
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,519
is dangerous about an S1 I would like to

795
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:45,319
pull it out right

796
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,199
now yeah another interesting question I

797
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,280
I don't think that there I mean I don't

798
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,519
think that we can look at all S1 seeds

799
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,880
and say these seeds are going to have

800
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:57,838
this set of problems um so you really

801
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,200
have to take it on a caseby casee basis

802
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:04,318
again S1 making s1s sorry crossing a

803
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:07,078
plant to itself is the most severe form

804
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:08,639
of inbreeding that we can do in any in

805
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,079
any

806
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:14,559
species um you know part of what keeps

807
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,920
us safe as humans is is the fact that we

808
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:21,078
have to have sex with a member of the

809
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,400
opposite um of the opposite sex in order

810
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,960
to have

811
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,838
Offspring um and that process in just

812
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,039
because we've EV evolved to have males

813
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,838
and females that process it kind of

814
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,719
prevents in breeding or at least it's

815
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:38,679
it's um a mating system that's designed

816
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:42,439
and one of the one of the consequences

817
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:45,000
is that it inhibits in breeding because

818
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,480
we're always breeding to someone else

819
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,639
this is the opposite what we're doing

820
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,519
here is the exact opposite and we're

821
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:55,400
reducing it we're removing any genetic

822
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:58,119
contribution from any other

823
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,440
individual and then we're subject that

824
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,000
one the the genetic variation that

825
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,200
exists within that one

826
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
individual we're subjecting that tiny

827
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:12,039
little gene pool to a step of inbreeding

828
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,838
that by definition removes 25% of the

829
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:19,358
variation in any subsequent individual

830
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:23,199
and so it's a very um it's a very severe

831
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:25,559
form of inbreeding and therefore if the

832
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,598
parent that we used in that inbreeding

833
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:30,400
step has any genetic weakness es those

834
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,880
genetic weaknesses are going to express

835
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,318
themselves in the S1

836
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Generation Um it's kind of like doubling

837
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:39,119
it's kind of like doubling down on one

838
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,119
thing it's like okay you know you're

839
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,440
you're putting all your chips on this

840
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,800
one plant you know you you actually

841
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,358
couldn't have said it better and I've

842
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,160
never actually thought of it in those

843
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:53,318
terms but it really is it it really is

844
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:56,039
genetic doubling down we've identified

845
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:58,119
and and in in a in a sense Shango what

846
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:01,039
we're trying to do is double On Any

847
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,760
Given trait like you know using the

848
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,480
legend OG you know individual we were

849
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,720
talking about before that that plant's

850
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,079
got a spike a linol oil that's kind of

851
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:13,078
it's it's it's much higher than your

852
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,400
normal OG or gassy type plant and so

853
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,400
that gives it like a little bit of an

854
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,000
interesting kick and so by selfing

855
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,160
it by selfing that individual and

856
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,960
removing any genetic combination or

857
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,078
contribution from any other plant we're

858
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,280
hoping that in the next off in the Next

859
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,318
Generation

860
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,079
we might find an individual that has

861
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:36,039
even higher levels of little oil right

862
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,839
and and that's kind of what you're doing

863
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:42,079
with an S1 is like when you have a a

864
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,639
rare trait you know say it's like

865
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,680
something visual that everybody can

866
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:48,559
understand say you get a plant with

867
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,519
these bright fuchsia pistols and no

868
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,199
other

869
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,559
plant even in the immediate family like

870
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:58,159
none of the brothers or none of the

871
00:38:53,559 --> 00:39:00,759
sisters of that family have the same

872
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:04,159
um these same Pink Pistols if you're

873
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,000
trying to to if if you like that trade

874
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,799
and you say hey I want all of my plants

875
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,679
in the Next Generation to have pink

876
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,039
pistols the question becomes which plant

877
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,838
do I hybridize the pink pistol plant

878
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,920
with in

879
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:22,639
order for all the plants in the Next

880
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:25,358
Generation to produce Pink Pistols right

881
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:28,279
and it may sound kind of tra but the

882
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:31,960
obvious answer is you want to breed it

883
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,800
with a plant that also has pink pistols

884
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:39,240
right and so if there are no other pink

885
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,240
pistol plants within that population the

886
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:44,838
most likely plant to contribute that

887
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,719
same genetic trait is that very plant

888
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:50,039
itself right and so what we're hoping is

889
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,399
that by mating the plant itself to

890
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,800
itself that all of the plants in the

891
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,880
next generation are going to have that

892
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,920
trait and if they don't all have that

893
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,960
trait

894
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,559
at least we can start making

895
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,159
some um conclusions or

896
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:09,759
hypotheses about how that trait is

897
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:11,239
inherited based on the representation of

898
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,520
that trait in the Next

899
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:16,000
Generation right um so I kind of got

900
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:19,079
away from inherent weaknesses but I

901
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,760
think it's just to understand that the

902
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:25,280
weaknesses that exist in a potential S1

903
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,960
seed lot are really a result of the

904
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,160
technique the breeding technique

905
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,800
and it's there's not something that we

906
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:36,118
can say all S1 seeds are going to have

907
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,318
these specific set of problems because

908
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:42,079
the specific set of problems that might

909
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,838
arise are are a result of what is hidden

910
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,280
in the genetic background of the plants

911
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:49,400
that we're mating um it kind of reminds

912
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,680
me of leveraged investing like whether

913
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,960
it be like stocks or Bitcoins or

914
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,838
whatever where where you know when

915
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,039
things go good because you're leveraged

916
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:01,440
they go really really good and when

917
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,079
things go bad because you're leveraged

918
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,318
they go really really bad because there

919
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,560
is like an exponential doubling down on

920
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:12,000
whatever that thing is same thing in

921
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:16,199
this case where if the breeder has done

922
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,880
their work and um you know they're using

923
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:23,239
a a good cut to begin with um it can

924
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,079
become a great cut because you are

925
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:27,399
breeding that plant to itself and

926
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,318
doubling down on those attributes but

927
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,318
but if it's a if it's a messy lineage

928
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,559
and it doesn't go well well it's it's

929
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:37,159
just going to be a freaking wreck um

930
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,639
well it's not it's not necessarily going

931
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:41,118
to be a freaking wreck right the the

932
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:42,920
population as a whole might be a

933
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,640
freaking wreck but we might find those

934
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,039
one or two or three individuals that are

935
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:50,078
you know like in plant breeding is it's

936
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,039
all about raising the mean level of

937
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,079
performance of the plant on any set of

938
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:56,960
traits over Generations right and so if

939
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,519
we've got a plant that say let's call it

940
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,800
an eight and a half on a scale of 10 and

941
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:05,280
we breed it we make s1s of it and then

942
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,079
like we grow a 100 of the next of the

943
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,160
Next Generation if 95% of those plants

944
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:14,318
are a six or a five it doesn't really

945
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:16,799
matter if five of those plants are a 9

946
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,679
and a half or a 95 right they they've if

947
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,480
we found some plants that are better

948
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,318
than the one that we started with you

949
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,400
can kind of say oh well it was worth it

950
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,519
going through all that garbage to have

951
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,599
to find these ones that were even better

952
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:30,800
now if we're selling that seed lock to

953
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:33,160
the customers or to customers at a

954
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,559
finished project as a finished product

955
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:37,039
they're going to be pissed off that only

956
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,680
5% of the plants are suitable and are

957
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:43,480
actually like better performing than the

958
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,960
plant that we got them from right and so

959
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,240
that's kind of where we fall back into

960
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,199
that discussion about like is selling S1

961
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:53,838
seeds a finished product or is it a

962
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:55,558
service to the community right like you

963
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,358
know I also didn't want to create the

964
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:59,559
impression that that's what Cale is

965
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,880
doing is just pumping out s1's for money

966
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,640
like he makes s1's as he's doing other

967
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,160
steps in breeding projects and if you

968
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,759
follow his Instagram where he where he

969
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:11,838
shows his

970
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,760
work you can very clearly see that

971
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:18,400
making Paul and in the you know making

972
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,880
let's again I'll use like the OG example

973
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,760
again that Legend OG if he's C making

974
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,640
Legend OG L S1 seeds he creates pollen

975
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,880
from that S1 that Legend S1 or that

976
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:33,838
treated S1 that treated Legends

977
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,240
plant at the same time as he fertilizes

978
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,799
that plant the same the legend he also

979
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,159
fertilizes a bunch of other things that

980
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,200
are part of his breeding projects right

981
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:46,519
and those seeds don't necessarily get

982
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:50,078
sold for seed and so in a way the

983
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:53,239
community is Ren numerating Caleb

984
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,119
for doing that work and creating the s1s

985
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:59,679
and sharing them throughout the the

986
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:02,119
global gene pool and that function of

987
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,719
making S1 seeds kind of pays for a

988
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:07,318
little bit of the R&amp;D costs for him to

989
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:09,358
move along his breeding program right

990
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:11,279
because breeding is you know it's not

991
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,318
like if you're growing if you're growing

992
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,200
weed to make money you're pumping out

993
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,800
crop after crop of clones you're getting

994
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:20,439
like a high dollar value for your your

995
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,920
crop when you're taking that same space

996
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,960
and dedicating to breeding and like we

997
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,760
just said in this example you end up

998
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,679
with 95% of the plants are are below par

999
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,359
you're not really using the making the

1000
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:35,919
best use or the best financial use of

1001
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,239
that like crop footprint right you'd be

1002
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,240
making more money if you were grown

1003
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:41,919
clones but because you're doing this

1004
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,118
work as a breeder you kind of in a sense

1005
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,400
waste your space or you don't optimize

1006
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,920
your space in the hopes that something

1007
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,240
better is going to come forward and so I

1008
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,358
really do find I feel that you know

1009
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:57,759
making these s1's in the market that he

1010
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,440
has access to all these things

1011
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,319
all these popular plants is really like

1012
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,079
quite a service to the community I

1013
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:06,440
really like this description of of you

1014
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,880
know these seeds that are an

1015
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:14,639
intermediary step that he uses as a

1016
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:16,640
breeder on his way to his own crosses

1017
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,358
and so he's sharing his intermediate

1018
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:21,558
step it reminds me a lot of I grew grew

1019
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:24,558
up in a family of professional

1020
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:27,800
carpenters and they would often have

1021
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:31,280
tools that did really cool things and

1022
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:35,519
woodworking that a friend had made a

1023
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,280
friend designed and woodwork a tool for

1024
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,079
wood working and then would like sell it

1025
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,400
to like friends at the bar or whatever

1026
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:46,839
you know and so this this pool of people

1027
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:49,720
around that particular woodworker would

1028
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:53,318
have this tool that the Craftsman made

1029
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:56,480
to make their craft better and in a lot

1030
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:59,679
of ways that feels like what Caleb's s1s

1031
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:03,119
are is like hey here are here's this

1032
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,960
tool I made to make my crosses and I'm

1033
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,000
not going to hoard it i' love to keep it

1034
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:11,358
out there and so I'm going to offer this

1035
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,639
tool into the community um as well um so

1036

00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,679
to you it all is is are you picking up

1040
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,519
what we're putting down or or are your

1041
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,480
motivations actually like you know

1042
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,318
different and we're actually missing it

1043
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:34,199
Oh no you're you're pretty accurate on

1044
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:37,759
them I mean um I pretty much put

1045
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:43,399
everything I make right back into

1046
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:47,480
breeding and uh yeah um a lot of the

1047
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:52,160
stuff I do makes zero dollar and costs a

1048
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:54,079
lot so yeah it's definitely Rings true

1153
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,640
one of the challenges with buying

1154
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:58,920
Autoflower seeds is that often you

1155
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,318
you'll have as many different fenos as

1156
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,240
you will have seeds in a pack that can

1157
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:06,480
be fun sure but so many varieties in one

1158
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:09,239
pack is a sign of an immature seedline

1159
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,960
that hasn't been worked enough I prefer

1160
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:12,719
my autof flowers to be worked enough

1161
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,720
that each feno in the pack really

1162
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:15,759
captures the aspects that the breeder

1163
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,919
was

1164
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,839
intending this is why I recommend gnome

1165
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,119
automatics to my friends and listeners

1166

1167
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,838
seeds gnome automatic seeds are not just

1168
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,480
crossed and released they are

1169
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:33,039
painstakingly sifted again and again

1170
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,318
tested in a wide range of conditions and

1171
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:38,480
taken to a level of maturity that each

1172
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:40,719
plant will be recognizable by its traits

1173
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,760
traits that were hard-earned so that you

1174

listening to shaping fire I am your host

1201
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:51,759
Shango Los and my guests today are Ryan

1202
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:53,838
Lee and Caleb inspecta so you know this

1203
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,040
second set is all about the attributes

1204
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:58,679
of these S1 seeds we we touched on it a

1205
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:02,239
bit during set one but you know the goal

1206
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:05,960
is to dig into it much more now and and

1207
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:07,078
during the break um you know I I Ryan

1208
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,039
and I were talking about whether or not

1209
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:11,760
he makes s1s because I was under the

1210
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:14,558
assumption that he didn't but he's like

1211
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:18,160
oh no I make s1's and so that's where

1212
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:19,680
we're actually going to start so um so

1213
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:22,318
Ryan you

1214
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,078
know i' I've never heard I've never seen

1215
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,880
any of your s1s but now that we've

1216
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:30,480
talked about during the first set about

1217
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:34,079
how making s1's doesn't necessarily need

1218
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:38,519
to be a like commercial retail project

1219
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:42,240
that making s1's is often a intermediary

1220
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:45,199
step when breeding um like making your

1221
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:47,679
own tools as an artisan this kind of

1222
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:49,039
brings it puts it in a new light so so

1223
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,558
I'll just kind of like ask you that

1224
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:54,558
question generally and and let you hit

1225
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:56,480
it um do you make s1's as part of your

1226
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,680
breeding projects and what's your

1227
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,400
personal use for them yeah I to me it's

1228
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,838
really become a crucial part of a of

1229
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,880
breeding projects because it wa for many

1230
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:08,719
reasons but for one reason it really

1231
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,000
allows you to get a look at the gene or

1232
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:14,959
interactions within the plant um and you

1233
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,400
can understand how those genes in that

1234
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,559
one plant are inherited you know do we

1235
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,960
see the the do we like for example if

1236
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,599
we're looking at the scent of a plant if

1237
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,000
we have a plant that we've isolated from

1238
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:29,440
a population and it's special we create

1239
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,159
a self- population from it and then we

1240
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,519
can look at that self- population and

1241
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:36,960
say hey did that very interesting scent

1242
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:38,920
profile from the parent reappear in the

1243
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,358
population and if it appears in the

1244
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,960
entire population that's kind of the

1245
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:46,920
best case scenario it's not often the

1246
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,920
way that it works but if if all of the

1247
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,960
plants for example show a given trait

1248
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,079
show that trait it's reproduced then we

1249
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,838
know that that trait is what we call

1250
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,400
true breeding or homozygous in

1251
00:54:56,838 --> 00:55:01,199
in the population or in in that in that

1252
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,480
parental plant and in the population

1253
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:06,879
that was created from that plant and so

1254
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,719
what that tells us is that when if we

1255
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:12,119
want to cross that population or any

1256
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:14,719
plant from that population to an

1257
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:18,358
unrelated gene pool or an unrelated

1258
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:21,239
plant we know that the gene responsible

1259
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:25,199
for the smell is going to go along for

1260
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:27,919
the cross right and so it's kind of like

1261
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,838
you can think of it like playing cards

1262
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,880
like you know those playing cards that

1263
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,639
people collect for baseball cards or or

1264
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,079
or hockey cards or whatever it has all

1265
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,679
the statistics of the plant right and so

1266
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:40,920
you can kind of think of like the first

1267
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:42,598
generation when we identify the plant

1268
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,519
that's kind of like getting the picture

1269
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,838
at the top of the playing card but

1270
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:48,639
without any of the information like the

1271
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:50,798
the details of the statistics of that

1272
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,639
player right and

1273
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:55,559
so when we when we do the self

1274
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:58,078
generation and we start growing out The

1275
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,480
Offspring and taking notes about the

1276
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,760
different individuals in that Offspring

1277
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,679
we can learn a whole lot about the the

1278
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,880
individual plant that was selfed for

1279
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:10,239
example we can we can understand about

1280
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,640
the cannaboid ratio you know uh is is

1281
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,118
this plant a pure THC plant I think we

1282
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,759
can kind of stay in that pure THC

1283
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,240
category category because I think that's

1284
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,359
where most of the listeners are coming

1285
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:23,439
from but even within a plant that is

1286
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:26,480
pure THC it can produce low intermediate

1287
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,240
or high levels of cannabinoids right and

1288
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:33,719
you might have like a plant that is like

1289
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:36,239
a 23 24% plant that has one copy of the

1290
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:39,078
high canabo production genes and one

1291
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:41,239
intermediate copy of the of the sorry

1292
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:43,318
one copy of the intermediate cannaboid

1293
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:47,239
production genes and

1294
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:50,199
so you know just by selfing the

1295
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:52,078
generation we can start to learn about

1296
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:54,279
the different genes that are within the

1297
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,160
individual that we' selected from our

1298
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:59,839
population right and so

1299
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:02,960
when we talk about preservation if I'm

1300
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,639
growing a new let's just use the land

1301
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,920
race example because that's an easy one

1302
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,759
for people to

1303
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,000
get I get some seeds from Thailand I

1304
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,039
grow at a 100 I find a very special

1305
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,599
individual or sorry the first thing I'll

1306
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:16,520
do is I'm growing if I'm growing 100

1307
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:18,838
plants you'll throw away the obvious

1308
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:21,838
dogs the plants that are just terrible

1309
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:23,558
for whatever set of reasons um I don't

1310
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:26,519
like to do that chemically in the first

1311
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:28,798
generation of a wild population because

1312
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:31,639
those dog or weird plants that are kind

1313
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:36,480
of ugly and underperforming they may

1314
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:39,558
have rare canabo genes in them and so if

1315
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,679
we're looking for a rare genan just that

1316
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:44,359
one trait enough is is enough to select

1317
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:46,038
the individual right but typically when

1318
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:48,719
you're growing the family you will let

1319
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:52,920
all the plants breed together and that's

1320
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:56,838
your first true I call it like

1321
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,318
raw um Gene capture or Gene preservation

1322
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:00,920
because you're trying to essentially

1323
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:04,558
capture everything that was that exists

1324
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:06,440
within the population that you have the

1325
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,000
second step is selection where we

1326
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,318
actually go through that population and

1327
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,838
we look at the female plants and we

1328
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,400
start selecting those plants based on

1329
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:16,880
any given set of traits one type of

1330
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,519
breeding that you can do is take that

1331
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,318
selected female individual that has all

1332
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,079
the the open pollinated seeds from all

1333
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,519
the different um fertilizers or the

1334
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:28,720
different pollen donors in that that

1335
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:30,400
population and so it's like half

1336
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,679
selected it's it's selected by the

1337
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,559
female but it's really unselected by the

1338
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:37,279
pollen donors that hit

1339
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,359
it if that female plant has a really

1340
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,400
special trait that we want to examine

1341
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:44,679
you don't want any of those other poin

1342
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,440
contributors in the mix and so in that

1343
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:49,838
case you you take that individual plant

1344
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,519
and you do create S1 seed from that

1345
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:55,358
plant and now you've

1346
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:56,759
preserved not the entire genes of the

1347
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:57,798
entire popul

1348
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,400
but you've

1349
00:58:57,798 --> 00:59:04,199
preserved the the genetic recombination

1350
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,519
of the of the genetic history of that

1351
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:08,759
one specific

1352
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:12,719
plan right

1353
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:14,640
um so I see those things as you know

1354
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:17,480
that's kind of the the two ranges of any

1355
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:21,159
breeding project with selfing being the

1356
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:24,719
most inbreeding step but again if you

1357
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:26,679
found a very rare unusual plant that

1358
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,639
doesn't resemble anything else in the

1359
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:30,519
population you don't really want to

1360
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,000
cross it back to anything else in the

1361
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:34,440
population because there's a pretty good

1362
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,798
chance that you're going to lose that

1363
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,798
trait in this in subsequent generations

1364
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:42,318
and the only way to really keep it Pure

1365
00:59:39,798 --> 00:59:44,480
or to ensure that you're Crossing that

1366
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,279
plant with another plant that has the

1367
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,639
same trait is to breed it like I said

1368
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,480
before breed it with itself and that

1369
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:53,358
really allows you to examine the

1370
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,719
heterozygosity or the

1371
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:59,880
homozygosity of that one specific planet

1372
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,919
um now Caleb you had something about

1373
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,960
homozygosity and heterozygosity that you

1374
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,760
really wanted to talk about um with

1375
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,559
regard to S1 so I don't know if that's a

1376
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,760
good opportunity

1377
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:14,960
now yeah

1378
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:19,640
um basically uh I was just curious uh

1379
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:22,599
what your opinions are on uh

1380
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:24,038
utilizing uh s1s and then further

1381
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:28,838
Generations like

1382
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:34,359
S2s in uh um making lines that are much

1383
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:35,400
more uh is the correct term homo zga

1384
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:38,558
homo

1385
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,039
zygos yeah so I think probably the best

1386
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,119
thing to do is I'll make a diagram that

1387
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,920
we could put up on

1388
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:47,160
um on Instagram when this episode airs

1389
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,159
but

1390
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:51,639
essentially people it's going to be hard

1391
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:53,199
for some people that don't understand

1392
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:54,519
what a punet square is but we're we're

1393
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:57,038
going to introduce the concept of a

1394
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:59,920
punet square and a unet square is a way

1395
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:01,480
of symbolically looking at the

1396
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,798
hypothetical chromosomes of an

1397
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,679
individual plant um or sorry in in the

1398
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:11,599
genetic combinations that come when

1399
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:14,759
Crossing two individual plants

1400
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,798
and what what the result what you'll be

1401
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:21,319
able to see in the diagram that I show

1402
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:25,719
is that when we when we mate one plant

1403
01:01:21,318 --> 01:01:28,558
to itself any trait that is heterozygous

1404
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:30,879
which means okay we all we all have to

1405
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,599
remember every person that is listening

1406
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,280
to this chromosome you have 23 sets of

1407
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,880
chromosomes one set of chromosome you

1408
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:42,319
inherited from your mother and one set

1409
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:46,358
you inherited from your father and so

1410
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:50,358
for any trait eye color height hair

1411
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:52,358
color um blood type one piece of the

1412
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:54,358
genetic information was inherited from

1413
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:56,038
your mother and one piece of the genetic

1414
01:01:54,358 --> 01:01:58,239
inh information was inherited from from

1415
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:58,240
your

1416
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,719
father those two pieces of genetic

1417
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,278
information on opposite chromosome for

1418
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,078
any trait they can either be the same or

1419
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:09,719
they can be different and so if you have

1420
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:13,278
blue eyes for example you have two

1421
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:15,759
copies of the same blueeyed gene on each

1422
01:02:13,278 --> 01:02:18,400
chromosome if you have brown

1423
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,359
eyes you could either have two copies of

1424
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,400
the brown eye trait or you could have

1425
01:02:20,358 --> 01:02:26,119
one copy of the brown ey tra and

1426
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,480
so in in the cannabis plant world

1427
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:32,880
selfing a plant and and looking at the

1428
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:35,358
ratio of just one given trait in The

1429
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,880
Offspring tells us whether our parental

1430
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:40,078
plant was homozygous or

1431
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,318
heterozygous if the plant for example

1432
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,359
let's go back to our pink pistol plant

1433
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:46,400
in our well pink pistol plant maybe it's

1434
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:48,119
not a great well we'll use it anyway so

1435
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,639
if you use a if you use a pink pistol

1436
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:52,079
plant and we self that plant if all of

1437
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:55,159
The

1438
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:59,039
Offspring from that self-cross have pink

1439
01:02:55,159 --> 01:03:01,719
pistols we can say that the trait

1440
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,640
responsible for the pink pistols in the

1441
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:07,759
parent was homozygous in other words the

1442
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:12,719
parent had two copies of that pink

1443
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,720
pisted Jean okay and

1444
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:20,118
so we if we had another

1445
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:22,118
um I guess we'd use the pink pistol

1446
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:23,798
plants again and another example if we

1447
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:26,680
had a pink pistol plant and we crossed

1448
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:29,679
it to itself and in The Offspring

1449
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:33,399
only 50% of The Offspring

1450
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,199
had that pink pistol trait we would know

1451
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,838
that

1452
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:41,118
that parental plant has more than

1453
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:44,119
one um set of chromosomes because in The

1454
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:46,200
Offspring we would say we would see say

1455
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:48,680
three individuals with pink pistols and

1456
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:51,480
one individual with call it purple

1457
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:56,480
pistols okay

1458
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:58,960
um and so by looking at at self

1459
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,278
populations we can essentially examine

1460
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,318
the degree of heterozygosity of a plant

1461
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:06,199
now one thing that we know and I I'll

1462
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,920
show this in the diagram that we post is

1463
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:12,960
that every generation of selfing

1464
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:15,440
produces 25% greater homo zos which

1465
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,440
means we're increasing the inbreeding at

1466
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:22,440
every generation by 25% and we're

1467
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:25,000
actually purging 25% of the genetic

1468
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:27,838
variation if we only look at one

1469
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,599
individual go going down that S1 S2 S3

1470
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:33,960
line so if what you were saying Caleb

1471
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:36,798
you might have a plant you know and that

1472
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,559
that Legend OG plant might be a good

1473
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:42,278
example the the original plant has Lin

1474
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:46,480
has linol in the um in the flavor

1475
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:46,480
profile if you self

1476
01:04:46,838 --> 01:04:55,078
Legend one in I think it's one in three

1477
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:55,079
come back with the desired scent profile

1478
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:01,519
and then if you if you breed that if you

1479
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:03,838
select that individual plant and breed

1480
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,679
it again you can actually get to a

1481
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:07,960
condition where you

1482
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:09,719
have all the plants have the desired

1483
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,278
scent profile and that's because we've

1484
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:14,480
removed through

1485
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:18,119
inbreeding the the heterozygosity at

1486
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,278
that one specific genetic um spot on the

1487
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:24,559
chromosome which is what we call a

1488
01:05:19,278 --> 01:05:26,838
genetic Locus so um yeah like serly in

1489
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,559
lines we can start inbreeding very

1490
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:31,318
heavily for specific traits the problem

1491
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:34,000
is when we do that with

1492
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:36,318
cannabis um which is also an obligate

1493
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,119
outcrosser like humans are we kind of

1494
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:41,038
run into this problem that the royal

1495
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,720
families around the world have run into

1496
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:46,760
through through in breeding is that that

1497
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:50,038
while sure you're keeping the blood blue

1498
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,760
and pure you're and and in our case we

1499
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:55,240
might actually be selecting for things

1500
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:58,640
that we like there's always in plant

1501
01:05:55,239 --> 01:06:01,318
breeding there's always this concept of

1502
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:03,358
like the genetic neighbors of the trait

1503
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:06,239
that we like they come along for the

1504
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:09,598
ride and if those genetic neighbors are

1505
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:13,078
like below average or like negative

1506
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:15,039
traits then we can actually be doing um

1507
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:17,760
genetic damage to the population as a

1508
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,880
whole and that's why we keep you know

1509
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,119
when we go when we get down to say

1510
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:26,160
S1 at S1 you won't just look at you know

1511
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:29,960
say say we grow 100 S1 seeds and we five

1512
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:31,920
plants that are special usually what

1513
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,760
I'll do is I'll take the best plant well

1514
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,680
depending on the project I'll take the

1515
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,039
best plant and I'll fertilize itself

1516
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:41,159
I'll do a F1 seed out of the best plant

1517
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,839
but I'll also take that pollen and I'll

1518
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:46,480
uh fertilize the sis the the siblings

1519
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:48,880
the sisters right and if I have the time

1520
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,278
in the space or the the project is

1521
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,599
really important I'll actually self all

1522
01:06:51,278 --> 01:06:58,199
those individual sisters as well and so

1523
01:06:54,599 --> 01:07:01,200
now from S1 down to S3 we don't just

1524
01:06:58,199 --> 01:07:04,118
follow one the the the population from

1525
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:06,239
one individual we'll follow populations

1526
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:08,920
from each of the

1527
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:11,798
individuals always looking to make sure

1528
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:14,318
that the traits that are important to us

1529
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:16,278
come along for the ride but we're also

1530
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,400
going to see that some of those families

1531
01:07:16,278 --> 01:07:21,599
that we've created have bad traits and

1532
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,960
we want to throw those ones away

1533
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,318
right it's just a factor of inbreeding

1534
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:28,199
when you when we start inbreeding you

1535
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:30,119
have we have problems so we have to take

1536
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:33,519
you know precautionary

1537
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:33,519
measures right

1538
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:38,719
right do you have a followup on that um

1539
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,199
Caleb or should I move

1540
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:46,558
on

1541
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:48,159
um no I I think I I think I agree um

1542
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:53,920
especially with

1543
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:56,598
uh like uh um breeding into the S2 S3

1544
01:07:53,920 --> 01:08:01,318
populations to you know really lock down

1545
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:04,240
those certain traits um you don't I

1546
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:09,079
don't think you ever get uh like a

1547
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:11,719
finished product um because they get so

1548
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:14,880
inbred that you know just because you've

1549
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:18,079
locked down the traits you want you you

1550
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,880
don't get a whole lot of a of a

1551
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:23,838
excellent growing plant the the Vigor

1552
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:27,199
goes down exponentially it seems with

1553
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:27,198
each self togenerate

1554
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,960
yeah and that's that's absolutely the

1555
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:36,838
case right that's the same Royal trouble

1556
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:38,679
right yep it is but but it's it's also

1557
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:40,278
import it's an important step that we

1558
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:42,640
have to get to

1559
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:44,239
because you know again if let's go back

1560
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,838
50 years and look what happened when we

1561
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:48,119
started getting cannabis from all over

1562
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:49,798
the world people in California and

1563
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:51,798
elsewhere but California was kind of the

1564
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:54,119
hot spot because you could grow a lot of

1565
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:56,039
these different things you know one year

1566
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:57,399
you'd get some lumbo from Colombian and

1567
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:59,119
you'd grow that out and it would be

1568
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,079
awesome and that would you you'd start

1569
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:03,158
growing that right and then next year

1570
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:04,798
somebody would show up with some TI bud

1571
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:06,519
and you'd keep some seeds of that and

1572
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:07,960
you'd be like okay well let's cross the

1573
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,719
tie into the Colombian and see what

1574
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:13,640
happens and on and on and on right and

1575
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,119
so over generations and generations we

1576
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:19,079
had all these relatively pure

1577
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:20,960
populations that were geographically

1578
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:23,278
isolated all around the

1579
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,119
world and then they came to California

1580
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,319
for this like big kind of Shuffle right

1581
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:30,640
and now we're in this like phase where

1582
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,279
we've really raised the level of quality

1583
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,560
from back then but we're still stuck in

1584
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:39,520
the shuffle right and

1585
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,839
so we need to get to to Really move to

1586
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,319
that next level of breeding where where

1587
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:46,158
you have lines you know when they when

1588
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,080
this happened with corn and they started

1589
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:52,119
really not domesticating corn but really

1590
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:53,880
like call it industrializing and getting

1591
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:56,198
like the academic institutions all over

1592
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,440
the world involved in you know

1593
01:09:56,198 --> 01:10:00,359
producing Bigger Better Batter corn so

1594
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:02,399
that we can feed the world they went

1595
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:04,359
through this same thing like they grow

1596
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:06,399
at all these families from all over the

1597
01:10:04,359 --> 01:10:07,559
world and you'd start inbreeding them

1598
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:09,599
because you want to keep your breeding

1599
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,800
populations pure and some of them would

1600
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,640
start having these bad like you know

1601
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:17,039
delorious traits would show up negative

1602
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,719
traits would show up and you kind of

1603
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,800
like it's kind of one of those things

1604
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:23,960
where like the only way out is through

1605
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,679
right like sometimes you inbreed and you

1606
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,640
inbreed and the line goes to crap but

1607
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:30,719
sometimes you can actually inbreed it

1608
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,079
and you can remove the crap and all of a

1609
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,399
sudden you've got a line that's true

1610
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,800
breeding and it's actually really quite

1611
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:42,319
good um because you know we also have to

1612
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:44,480
to remember cannabis as an obligate

1613
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:45,399
outcrosser one of the things about that

1614
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,639
obligate

1615
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:49,479
outcrossing um mating system that

1616
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,960
cannabis and humans have is that we

1617
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:53,238
never really get rid of genetic

1618
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,880
variation right so as long as everybody

1619
01:10:53,238 --> 01:10:56,839
around the world I'm talking humans is

1620
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,239
breeding and having

1621
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,960
kids we don't have like if you look at

1622
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:05,279
the human population as a whole we don't

1623
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:07,239
have like one true breeding type but we

1624
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:08,759
have all these different variations

1625
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:11,000
existing all over the world all these

1626
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:13,000
different versions of genes and as long

1627
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,279
as the humans keep breeding those things

1628
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,079
never go away right whereas the the

1629
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:22,399
opposite is true for inbreeding

1630
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:24,800
species when we take a human

1631
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:26,198
population or say we take like a 100

1632
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,960
human populations and we start

1633
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:31,000
inbreeding them which is you know

1634
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,480
ethical and Unthinkable in our society

1635
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,279
but you know from a purely academic

1636
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:37,238
point of view if we were to start to

1637
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:38,479
mating and inbreeding families what

1638
01:11:37,238 --> 01:11:41,119
would happen

1639
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,759
is all these bad traits would show up

1640
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:44,599
like all this stuff that these genetic

1641
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,239
weaknesses disease and all the sorts of

1642
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,760
stuff would show

1643
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:52,039
up but theoretically if we did those in

1644
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,719
breedings in large enough populations

1645
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:55,800
we'd find genetic individuals from those

1646
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,520
populations

1647
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:00,199
that didn't have any of the the bad Al

1648
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:03,199
like just because of their

1649
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:04,839
genetic Lottery and and and their

1650
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:07,000
genetic history they only ended up with

1651
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,800
the good genes and not the bad genes if

1652
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,840
you then take those individuals and

1653
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,440
cross them together now you've got a

1654
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:17,000
population is highly inbred but has has

1655
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:20,719
gotten rid of all the the crap right and

1656
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,279
so K went through this uh 150 years ago

1657
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,439
or 100 years ago more more like 150

1658
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:25,800
years ago when they really started

1659
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:28,039
developing it

1660
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,600
and it like I said the only way out is

1661
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:32,079
through you have to weed your way

1662
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,760
through all the crab and inbreed and

1663
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:37,119
accept that you're going to get all this

1664
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:41,159
junk but the idea is to brush away the

1665
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:42,880
junk and in between in the mix is like

1666
01:12:41,158 --> 01:12:44,479
the diamonds are there right so we blow

1667
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,840
all the dust and the crap of the way

1668
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:48,238
then we've got the diamonds and when we

1669
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:52,159
start crossing the diamonds together now

1670
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:54,599
we've got diamonds reproducing right and

1671
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:56,719
so we're a long way from there with

1672
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,960
cannabis that is theoretically one of

1673
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:02,198
the ways to get through this is where we

1674
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,920
take all of these diverse populations

1675
01:13:02,198 --> 01:13:06,960
with all this heteros zygosity that

1676
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:10,239
we've built into them one by cannabis's

1677
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:12,800
breeding strategy but also two the way

1678
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:15,879
that we've been Crossing Colombian to TI

1679
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,520
to Afghan to White Widow to OG to Sour

1680
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,840
Diesel right like it's always Crossing

1681
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:22,320
in the next new thing nobody's really

1682
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,920
stopping and saying okay let's not

1683
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:27,519
introduce new stuff let's go down and

1684
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:29,920
and find these individual things and you

1685
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:32,000
know in the last 15 years we're starting

1686
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,560
to see this and you know the freak Show

1687
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,158
guys uh high-grade mutants I mean

1688
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,639
they're they're one example of this

1689
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:41,279
where they said hey we're not going to

1690
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:43,400
go out Crossing we're going to inbreed

1691
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,479
and they IM breeded Bas based on one

1692
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:47,920
leaf morphology but they created

1693
01:13:45,479 --> 01:13:50,079
something totally new right that's a

1694
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,840
whole new kind of variety I call it a

1695
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:54,399
variety because it it reproduces from

1696
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,600
seed it the the trait reproduces when

1697
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,960
true from seed

1698
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,039
and in a way DJ Short did the same thing

1699
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:03,000
you know back 15 20 or 25 years ago with

1700
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,198
blueberry that he kind of said he kind

1701
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,679
of said I'm not going to outcross I'm

1702
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:10,479
only going to in inbreed in my little

1703
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,719
pool you know and arguably what came out

1704
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:14,799
is like a little bit un It suffers for

1705
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:17,439
me in breeding depression but it's a

1706
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,199
great line to use for hybridizing right

1707
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:21,039
because he's fixed the purple trads and

1708
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,158
he's fixed a couple of other things in

1709
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:26,198
the you know in the stam and the leaves

1710
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:28,000
and um that kind of what you have to do

1711
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:29,638
in plant breeding is you have to go you

1712
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,039
have to force your way through the

1713
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:35,440
heterozygosity to develop homozygous

1714
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:38,600
true breeding lines and that's what

1715
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:42,158
you're doing Caleb by going down S2 S3

1716
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:44,719
S4 right once you get to that point in

1717
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:46,519
time though the question becomes you

1718
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,319
know what do you have you've essentially

1719
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:51,199
got like an heirloom variety that's

1720
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:53,719
probably kind of IM Brad and it's not

1721
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:56,879
going to be as good as your hybrid

1722
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:58,439
variety right a performance you know

1723
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,239
when I say as good I mean it's not going

1724
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:01,279
to perform as well it's not what you're

1725
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:02,799
going to put on the market and the

1726
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,759
customers are going to come come to want

1727
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,679
to buy to plant Fields right right

1728
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,960
they're going to want something with

1729
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,199
more Vigor and and size to it but once

1730
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:14,158
it's true breeding like that now you

1731
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:17,198
have a real tool that you can use to

1732
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:19,319
test cross against your different

1733
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:21,960
lines that have also gone through that

1734
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:23,880
same kind of measure and once you start

1735
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,679
Crossing those things back together

1736
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:28,279
you're going to see again

1737
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,158
that real true hybrid Vigor that the

1738
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:32,359
people in the 60s and 70s were seeing

1739
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:35,719
and they when they would cross Colombia

1740
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:38,880
to Thai right because you've got two

1741
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:41,239
true breeding indiv or lines that are

1742
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:44,679
distinct and when they come together now

1743
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:46,238
you've got like a real F1 seed right

1744
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:48,760
right which arguably doesn't really

1745
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:49,879
exist in say cannabis seed Market so not

1746
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,400
too

1747
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:56,480
often

1748
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:59,198
no so Ryan um in in one of your examples

1749
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:01,599
where you've got all these inbred humans

1750
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:03,519
and and then one group are developing

1751
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,400
all these great traits and then this

1752
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,639
other group are Divi um developing all

1753
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,960
these negative traits I swear to God

1754
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:13,679
that sounds like a premise for a new

1755
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,840
Marvel movie right because all of the

1756
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,880
all of the great traits become like the

1757
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,319
superhero and all the negative traits

1758
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,960
become like the villain and then boom

1759
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:26,799
now we've just got two hours of sci-fi

1760
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:29,800
so um uh so Caleb you know we know that

1761
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:33,520
you make s1's that you share with all of

1762
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:37,480
us as part of your own breeding projects

1763
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:41,159
and we understand better now how um how

1764
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:43,799
creating s1's um helps lock down

1765
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:48,039
particular traits for the breeder to

1766
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:52,360
work with when you are making these s1s

1767
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:57,198
for your bigger um breeding project do

1768
01:16:52,359 --> 01:17:00,079
you find that um you make multiple s1s

1769
01:16:57,198 --> 01:17:03,119
of of different I guess I'll say phenos

1770
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:05,679
of a plant so that you can say okay I've

1771
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:09,760
S1 this one because I like the structure

1772
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:12,079
I've S1 this one because um I I prefer

1773
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,440
the the tarpine profile I've done this

1774
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:16,800
one because it finishes early and then

1775
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:19,559
now that I've got this pool of s1's now

1776
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:23,639
I'm going to breed these hoping to

1777
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:27,159
capture the best of all of them oh yeah

1778
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:29,639
definitely um one of my more uh recent

1779
01:17:27,158 --> 01:17:32,439
ones I've been working on is uh the

1780
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:35,920
purple KES so you know I I grew out over

1781
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:38,238
a hundred of them and I made you know I

1782
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:41,199
don't know um give or take a dozen

1783
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:43,959
selections maybe more um for different

1784
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:46,879
traits you know I never I never try to

1785
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:50,399
you know select just for one thing so

1786
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,679
you know on one I selected for like the

1787
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:54,879
you know the orange chocy turpins and

1788
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:58,920
another I selected for just you know

1789
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:01,600
know the the big purple flowers and you

1790
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:05,639
know so it wasn't all for just one tray

1791
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:10,600
and then for the you know the uh sister

1792
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:12,119
sister I guess uh Generation Um I don't

1793
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,480
even

1794
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:18,679
specifically know what to call those if

1795
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:22,399
they're S2s or or what would you call

1796
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:25,319
those uh where you breed a S1 with its

1797
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:27,479
S1 sister Ryan

1798
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:30,880
what's the cor it's so it's a it would

1799
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:33,678
be a c cross it would be you might

1800
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,639
denote it like S1

1801
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:39,119
F2 yeah that's what I was kind of

1802
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:41,000
thinking it's just it yeah it I mean

1803
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:43,359
when we're labeling those things it's

1804
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,279
really like the important thing is to

1805
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:48,359
give a code that you know obviously and

1806
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:49,880
it means something to you and then I

1807
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:51,599
think the only other real important

1808
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,119
thing about naming plants or at least

1809
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,320
the generations is to convey the that

1810
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:59,639
information to somebody else so that

1811
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:01,679
they can understand what the genetic

1812
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:03,719
condition might be in those seeds when I

1813
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:07,880
get seeds I kind of like to

1814
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:11,239
know how homozygous or heterozygous they

1815
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:12,880
are um can I just jump in on one quick

1816
01:19:11,238 --> 01:19:16,839
point that like kind of along the line

1817
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:19,079
that you're talking about um Shango you

1818
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:23,319
asked if you if you if you self

1819
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:25,559
different individuals from an S1 seed

1820
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:26,799
one reason you might do that for example

1821
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,800
I'll give you an example when we were

1822
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,360
back when we were breeding THC and CBD

1823
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,320
ratios you know Say the original plant

1824
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:37,079
is a one:1 THC to CBD when you cross

1825
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:39,759
that plant to itself we end up with a

1826
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:44,679
population that is like roughly a one to

1827
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:48,840
two to one ratio of THC plants so you

1828
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:53,079
call it 25% THC plants 50%

1829
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:55,679
CBD and THC plants and then

1830
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:58,639
25% CBD

1831
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,760
right so in order to prove to yourself

1832
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:03,480
and this is kind of an obvious thing but

1833
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:05,800
you know it it applies to other traits

1834
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:08,198
other than just can avonoid ratios in

1835
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,920
order to prove to yourself The

1836
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:12,599
Inheritance pattern of those traits what

1837
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,039
you would do is self one of the THC

1838
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:17,719
plants you'd again self one of the one

1839
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:20,560
to and then you'd self one of the CBD

1840
01:20:17,719 --> 01:20:23,480
plants right and you'd see when you self

1841
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,199
the THC plant they all have THC when you

1842
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:27,359
self the CBD plant

1843
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:30,279
they all have CBD when you self the one

1844
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:36,439
to one you get that

1845
01:20:30,279 --> 01:20:38,439
25% to 50% to 25% ratio of THC to one:

1846
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:42,519
one to

1847
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:44,479
CD and and so like it's you know for

1848
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,800
example say say we got in the purple

1849
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:47,919
Generations that that Caleb is talking

1850
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,400
about he's working with some purple

1851
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,719
crosses and he

1852
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:56,039
crosses uh he he has a special plant and

1853
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:58,000
it's purple highlights and you know he

1854
01:20:56,039 --> 01:21:00,760
thinks it's really interesting scent and

1855
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,719
I'm going to make an S1 out of the seeds

1856
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:06,360
he grows the S1 seeds 25% of the plants

1857
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:09,560
are completely purple 50% of the plants

1858
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:12,198
look like the mother and then 25% of the

1859
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:14,080
plants are completely green right well

1860
01:21:12,198 --> 01:21:16,759
if you're trying to understand and prove

1861
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:19,039
to yourself what happened you'd self one

1862
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:22,320
of each

1863
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:24,800
archetype and then see what happens in

1864
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:27,119
the Next Generation right and and what

1865
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,239
that tells you is like okay you know if

1866
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:31,920
if if we learn that that the purple

1867
01:21:29,238 --> 01:21:34,119
plants breed true and the green plants

1868
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,880
breed true but when we cross them

1869
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:38,840
together we get purple with or green

1870
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,359
with purple stripes you know now we

1871
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:43,800
understand the building blocks that we

1872
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:45,599
have to have in order to put back the

1873
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,039
the final product which is you know if

1874
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,440
we want it to be green with purple

1875
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:53,079
stripes right and so sometimes it has

1876
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:56,599
nothing to do with moving a project

1877
01:21:53,079 --> 01:22:00,399
forward other than trying to understand

1878
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:02,719
how does this trait inherit right um so

1879
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:07,039
there's one really good example or one

1880
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:07,039
use of a of how to use an S1

1881
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,960
Generation all right so let let's take

1882
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:16,400
this in a in a different direction now

1883
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:21,319
so so far we've been talking about um um

1884
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:23,960
using S1 to um capture a particular

1885
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:27,119
trait because and we want to use it um

1886
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:29,560
in in in a larger breeding project um

1887
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:33,599
but I know there's a lot of folks like

1888
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:37,120
me who who pick up S1 seeds not because

1889
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:40,159
I'm planning on breeding it but because

1890
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:43,279
I'm attracted to looking at the

1891
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:46,960
variations within a genome um for

1892
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:52,639
example two summers ago um I popped

1893
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:55,119
several packs of um Caleb's Skittles S1

1894
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,639
um because I like the original strain

1895
01:22:55,119 --> 01:23:00,000
but I'd also like to see you know what

1896
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:01,800
else is in there that was not the you

1897
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,639
know the championship cut what what else

1898
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:07,159
is in there and so I ran a whole bunch

1899
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,639
of these these Skittles s1's and it was

1900
01:23:07,158 --> 01:23:11,759
an absolute Delight you know to see this

1901
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:14,159
variety you know subtle differences in

1902
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:17,119
colors a lot of differences in tpping

1903
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:19,319
profiles um some differences in inner

1904
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:20,359
node length um I don't know it's like

1905
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:24,079
different you know it's just like going

1906
01:23:20,359 --> 01:23:26,519
to a party you know and and and that's a

1907
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:28,519
bad example but anyway it's just it was

1908
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:31,800
it's just cool to see a lot of different

1909
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:36,480
riffs on this same plant that I really

1910
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:38,800
like and so um my my question to you

1911
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,638
Caleb and and then um I've got a

1912
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,279
followup probably going to go to you

1913
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:47,279
Ryan is when you are now that you've

1914
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:49,719
made so many

1915
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:51,479
s1s like let let's say that there that

1916
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:53,198
I'm going to pop a thousand seeds right

1917
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:55,399
which would be freaking awesome but not

1918
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:58,399
something I'm probably likely to to do

1919
01:23:55,399 --> 01:24:00,000
um how the idea is so that we can

1920
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,759
capture as much of the genome

1921
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,600
representation as possible how many

1922
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:10,719
different Expressions would you expect

1923
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:14,280
to see um like are you seeing that when

1924
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:16,198
you when you visualize all Air quotes

1925
01:24:14,279 --> 01:24:19,399
all the different Expressions that are

1926
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:21,839
captured in that seed that you're all

1927
01:24:19,399 --> 01:24:23,960
like oh there's there's usually like you

1928
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,480
know 10 different varieties at the same

1929
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,279
time you could say there there might be

1930
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:30,359
a thousand different varieties or maybe

1931
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:34,479
800 different varieties because we know

1932
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:38,000
that the genetic picture is very complex

1933
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:41,759
and if the S1 is supposed to capture

1934
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,439
that picture then then if we pop a whole

1935
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,280
bunch of S1 seeds we might see that same

1936
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:49,678
genome expressed a lot of different ways

1937
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:52,519
so so how I kind of expect this answer

1938
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:54,760
to go is I I like to find out what you

1939
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,960
normally see from your experience since

1940
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:00,199
you're on the front lines doing this uh

1941
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:04,960
Caleb and then and then Ryan I'd love

1942
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:08,599
you for you to address this idea that um

1943
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:11,840
that s1s are an actual snapshot of what

1944
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:16,480
can be expressed in the

1945
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:20,679
genome so this is kind of uh similar to

1946
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:23,799
a question I get a lot um people

1947
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:26,800
ask um how many phenotypes are you going

1948
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:30,360
to see with these s1's well that's a

1949
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:33,279
really tough question because say if I'm

1950
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:36,479
running out aund and something uh URL

1951
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:40,000
s1's or 100 and something meno purple

1952
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:42,279
s1's you know both of those lines or

1953
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,158
both of those cuts

1954
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:50,238
S1 they the plants look very very

1955
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:55,198
similar like in veg you know there's not

1956
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:57,238
a huge amount of difference um

1957
01:25:55,198 --> 01:25:58,839
but when you get into flower you know

1958
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:01,718
the plants still look the same but

1959
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:05,039
there's all these different flower types

1960
01:26:01,719 --> 01:26:07,719
and coloration patterns and and uh

1961
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:10,439
tarpine profiles I mean that's where the

1962
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:12,399
huge segregation is you know with the

1963
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:18,960
Mendo purple as an example

1964
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:22,079
especially um so it I mean they all look

1965
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:24,880
you know plantwise like the same

1966
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:28,559
phenotype or genotype or whatever ever

1967
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:31,079
but you know it it's it's those you know

1968
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:34,000
those Tarpin and the and the flower you

1969
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:36,880
know structures and colors that are the

1970
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:40,520
real variables on there so I personally

1971
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:44,199
I don't even know how to you know

1972
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:47,960
quantify how many phenotypes and

1973
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:51,519
different you know individuals there

1974
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:53,920
are um you know that that's kind of

1975
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,159
always been a tough question for me you

1976
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,719
know yeah it's kind of a flawed question

1977
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,439
I think even and I think it it comes

1978
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,399
because people don't really understand

1979
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:05,960
the word Fen did you lean away did you

1980
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:10,158
lean away from your microphone um Ryan

1981
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:14,158
oh uh there you go yeah I I sat back I

1982
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:16,118
turned up the gain a little bit um it's

1983
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:19,638
kind of a flawed question because people

1984
01:27:16,118 --> 01:27:22,279
don't understand what the word phenotype

1985
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:26,118
means I think you know so for example

1986
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:26,118
let's have an example uh

1987
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:32,520
um you know oh you you're growing

1988
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:34,479
cookies cross chem and you've got the

1989
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,679
cookies phenotype because it's got those

1990
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:38,399
little rounded leaves right so anytime

1991
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:39,639
you see those little rounded leaves

1992
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:42,679
people will look at it and say oh that's

1993
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:45,440
the cookies phenotype well it might only

1994
01:27:42,679 --> 01:27:47,880
be that it only has the rounded leaves

1995
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:49,359
from the cookies but every other trait

1996
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:53,118
looks like the

1997
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:54,238
cam right and so it's you know it's like

1998
01:27:53,118 --> 01:27:56,719
imagine we're going to start

1999
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:59,158
categorizing actors and we say oh yeah

2000
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,800
Tom Cruz he's got like brown hair and

2001
01:27:59,158 --> 01:28:02,638
then and then all of a sudden anybody

2002
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,480
that you see that has the brown hair you

2003
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:07,359
start calling the Tom Cruz Vena type

2004
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:09,759
right that's what we do in the Cannabis

2005
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:12,599
world and it nothing could be further

2006
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:14,199
from the truth because as we know

2007
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,639
anybody that has brown hair doesn't mean

2008
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:16,919
that you're Tom it doesn't mean that

2009
01:28:15,639 --> 01:28:18,960
just because you have brown hair you're

2010
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,719
Tom Cruz right like that should be

2011
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:24,639
self-evident but for some reason in the

2012
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:27,039
Cannabis World We tend to think

2013
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,319
that oh if you have this one trait from

2014
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:31,679
that one genetic

2015
01:28:29,319 --> 01:28:34,000
background the assumption is like the

2016
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:35,600
entire plant must have all the other

2017
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,560
traits that also come with that genetic

2018
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,000
background that's not how genetics work

2019
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,400
right one of mle's laws which is mendle

2020
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,158
is kind of like the grandfather of of

2021
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:46,679
inheritance Gregor mendle people can

2022
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:48,719
look him up the few that haven't heard

2023
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:51,079
of him but one of his laws of

2024
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:54,158
inheritance was independent assortment

2025
01:28:51,079 --> 01:28:56,279
of traits and that so that means like if

2026
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:59,319
you have blue eyes and brown

2027
01:28:56,279 --> 01:29:01,759
hair and you you mate with someone that

2028
01:28:59,319 --> 01:29:04,679
has blonde hair and green

2029
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,520
eyes the hair color and the eye color in

2030
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:07,800
The Offspring aren't going to be related

2031
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,440
to each other like just because you have

2032
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,000
brown hair it doesn't mean that you're

2033
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:12,198
going to have blue eyes right just

2034
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
because you have blonde hair it doesn't

2035
01:29:12,198 --> 01:29:15,839
mean you're gonna have green eyes like

2036
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,319
you can have the reverse combination of

2037
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:21,920
blonde hair and blue eyes or green eyes

2038
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:24,840
and brown hair right and so when we

2039
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:26,719
start looking at like phenotype

2040
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,600
based on one trait you're really going

2041
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:31,439
to go down the wrong

2042
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:34,400
path

2043
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:36,279
um to wrap that back to what you were

2044
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:37,839
talking about Shango and like how many

2045
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:42,238
phenotypes

2046
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:47,719
exist phenotype is really is usually in

2047
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:47,718
reference to one trait right

2048
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:54,198
so like if we're talking about you know

2049
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:56,319
you were talking about like internos

2050
01:29:54,198 --> 01:29:57,559
length for example so like you know

2051
01:29:56,319 --> 01:30:01,000
there's going to be

2052
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:04,920
three internode length types within a

2053
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:07,319
population say short internode length

2054
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,679
intermediate internode length and long

2055
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:12,399
internode length right but all those

2056
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:14,199
long intern node lengths some might

2057
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:16,439
smell like cookies some might smell like

2058
01:30:14,198 --> 01:30:18,359
Pine some might smell like grapefruit

2059
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:20,399
some might smell like you know tropical

2060
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:23,599
Hawaii kind of mango

2061
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:25,559
scent but if we categorize them all by

2062
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,280
saying those are

2063
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:31,760
the those are the long eer node plants

2064
01:30:28,279 --> 01:30:35,158
that's not a really helpful way to sort

2065
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:37,079
or categorize them so I grock that but

2066
01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:44,198
let me let me slightly course correct my

2067
01:30:37,079 --> 01:30:47,039
question I am I am less curious about um

2068
01:30:44,198 --> 01:30:50,759
categorizing what I think of as a

2069
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:54,238
phenotype and more interest in

2070
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:57,920
categorizing the different plant Express

2071
01:30:54,238 --> 01:31:01,718
S I will see over a thousand seeds so if

2072
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:06,000
I pop a thousand of these S1 seeds in my

2073
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:10,079
head as a not not incredibly scientific

2074
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,279
knowledgeable person um I would think oh

2075
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:14,039
I want to pop all of these seeds so that

2076
01:31:12,279 --> 01:31:16,759
I can see all of the possible

2077
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:19,760
expressions of the Skittles from my

2078
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:23,079
example and I don't know if every one of

2079
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:26,440
those expressions would be considered a

2080
01:31:23,079 --> 01:31:29,158
pheno or not more to the point like

2081
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:33,519
let's say I pop a th000 seeds and and

2082
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:38,079
first one has is uh very flowery short

2083
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:41,159
plant um dark green color second one is

2084
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:43,840
um uh got a different smell profile it

2085
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:46,039
happens to be a very tall plant but it's

2086
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:48,319
got the same color the third one it's

2087
01:31:46,039 --> 01:31:52,279
got a totally different color but this

2088
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:54,439
one oddly smells a little more chemy um

2089
01:31:52,279 --> 01:31:59,158
and it's got this like odd

2090
01:31:54,439 --> 01:32:04,198
um pink pistol right so so if if each

2091
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:07,879
plant in the these thousand S1 seeds um

2092
01:32:04,198 --> 01:32:10,238
are a different mix and match of the

2093
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:14,359
potential in the

2094
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:18,319
genome I'm simply curious how many seeds

2095
01:32:14,359 --> 01:32:22,559
I would have to pop to see everything

2096
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:24,198
that the gene could do okay look that's

2097
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,119
it's a very complicated question

2098
01:32:24,198 --> 01:32:28,238
although it sounds simple it's actually

2099
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:29,198
a very it was very easy for me to say I

2100
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:31,959
don't know

2101
01:32:29,198 --> 01:32:33,359
how well no and and there is an answer

2102
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,639
but we have to kind of work through it a

2103
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:39,639
little bit okay so I'm gonna if if we

2104
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:43,079
may I'd like to start with it by

2105
01:32:39,639 --> 01:32:45,800
saying don't use the word phenotype or

2106
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:48,118
how many phenotypes would I see and

2107
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:51,560
instead substitute the word

2108
01:32:48,118 --> 01:32:53,479
individual all right okay and that

2109
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:56,280
really changes the concept right because

2110
01:32:53,479 --> 01:32:57,919
phen ypes are a grouping because I am

2111
01:32:56,279 --> 01:33:00,519
thinking about individual that's more

2112
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:03,480
what I'm thinking in my head right and

2113
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:05,000
it's it's it's more appropriate

2114
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:07,599
because

2115
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,479
genetically they are individual

2116
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:13,159
genotypes so you could refer to every

2117
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:16,079
plant as a genotype because the genetic

2118
01:33:13,158 --> 01:33:17,559
type of that individual is unique from

2119
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,079
all the other individuals in the

2120
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:21,600
population okay and so that's why I like

2121
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:24,039
the word individual because it really

2122
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,760
kind of hammers home that we're not

2123
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:29,399
about like when you use words like

2124
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:32,360
strain or phenotype it kind of says all

2125
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:34,359
these plants are the same right but the

2126
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:37,158
point that I think we're really asking

2127
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:39,920
or we're trying to hit home is that hey

2128
01:33:37,158 --> 01:33:42,799
all these plants are are

2129
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:44,719
individual individually and unique

2130
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,920
they're different from each other right

2131
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:50,639
and that's the important

2132
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:54,000
part now the question is how many will

2133
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:56,000
we see in a population remember S1 is a

2134
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,359
technique not a

2135
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,760
product okay and so if we look at it

2136
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:02,439
from

2137
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,719
that

2138
01:34:02,439 --> 01:34:07,719
lens how different and how many

2139
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:09,719
individuals any given S1 population are

2140
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:12,960
going to have how many different you

2141
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:15,920
know air quote phenotypes or visually

2142
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,439
chemically distinguishable individuals

2143
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:20,118
is going to be related to how true

2144
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:23,479
breeding the plant that we used to it to

2145
01:34:20,118 --> 01:34:27,000
inbreed and create the S1 generation so

2146
01:34:23,479 --> 01:34:29,158
our Colombian cross Thai I'm going to

2147
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:32,000
switch it up let's call it Tha cross

2148
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:33,920
Afghan because those two plants are like

2149
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,800
visually less similar than Colombian and

2150
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,560
Thai right the Afghan is real stocky

2151
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:41,480
small wide leaves the taii is the polar

2152
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,960
opposite tall thin leaves very different

2153
01:34:41,479 --> 01:34:45,439
flower

2154
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,000
structure if we cross those two plants

2155
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:50,399
together or together we hunt call out a

2156
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,399
thousand seeds we find the super

2157
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:56,679
individual from that hybrid between the

2158
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,679
two and then we self that

2159
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:02,079
individual the S1 generation from that

2160
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:04,960
individual is going to be a spectrum of

2161
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:07,479
plants from the Afghan all the way to

2162
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,639
the tii and every possible combination

2163
01:35:07,479 --> 01:35:12,638
in

2164
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:15,118
between okay and so that is an example

2165
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:19,118
where we selfed or we've created a

2166
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:22,039
segregating generation of an F1

2167
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:24,399
hybrid separately if we took that

2168
01:35:22,039 --> 01:35:26,198
individual Afghan plant that we cross to

2169
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:30,920
the tie and instead of Crossing it to

2170
01:35:26,198 --> 01:35:33,158
the tie we uh create a reversed male

2171
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,118
version of that clone using hormones we

2172
01:35:33,158 --> 01:35:38,000
self fertilize it and create create an

2173
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:39,880
S1 generation from that Afghani plant

2174
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,118
and then we grow it a thousand of those

2175
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:43,279
those plants are going to look more or

2176
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:45,359
less the same as The Afghani

2177
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:47,800
mother okay and that's because that

2178
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:51,118
Afghani plant was a true breeding plant

2179
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:53,279
and so you can see same process we we we

2180
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:54,880
did we made s1s from two individual

2181
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:56,960
plants but we had very different

2182
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,039
outcomes and those outcomes were

2183
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:02,639
directly related

2184
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:05,560
to the degree of heterozygosity or gen

2185
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:08,279
or genetic diversity that existed in the

2186
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,280
plant that we

2187
01:36:09,319 --> 01:36:16,158
selfed so what it comes down to excuse

2188
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:18,480
me what it comes down to is the number

2189
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:22,118
of individuals in that S1

2190
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:24,638
population really just depends on how

2191
01:36:22,118 --> 01:36:27,279
true breeding

2192
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:31,719
the the plant is that I

2193
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:33,519
S1 and so if if that if that original

2194
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:36,520
Parent the solo

2195
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:39,040
parent um you know it was a very

2196
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:42,119
well-worked line and it's and it tends

2197
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:45,679
to you know breed

2198
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:48,238
truish um there'll be a lot less variety

2199
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:50,000
but if there's a whole bunch of stuff

2200
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:51,959
that went into it and it's never been

2201
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,279
refined well then there's going to be a

2202
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:56,439
whole hell of a lot to sift through

2203
01:36:54,279 --> 01:36:58,000
Bingo and there's one other measure

2204
01:36:56,439 --> 01:37:00,238
measure that people in the community

2205
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,560
might have come across it's not going to

2206
01:37:00,238 --> 01:37:03,799
be everybody that's going to know this

2207
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:05,800
but back during the phos days and some

2208
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,719
of the other genetic company testing

2209
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:10,880
companies that are doing genetic testing

2210
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:12,800
they would provide you with a number

2211
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,359
that essentially was how true breeding

2212
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,360
is your plant or what's the level of

2213
01:37:14,359 --> 01:37:18,799
homozygosity or

2214
01:37:16,359 --> 01:37:21,198
heterozygosity the more heterozygosity

2215
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:24,320
that that that that test would show on a

2216
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:27,158
plant would equate to the more types of

2217
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:32,599
individuals you will see if that plant

2218
01:37:27,158 --> 01:37:35,479
is um inbred and and and had self seeds

2219
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,480
made from that one plant right and so

2220
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:39,879
when we cross two plants together we're

2221
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:41,198
talking about I mean you said before you

2222
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:43,719
know we're talking about someone's

2223
01:37:41,198 --> 01:37:46,399
genome we all have to remember Shango

2224
01:37:43,719 --> 01:37:49,000
you've got two genomes I have two

2225
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:51,920
genomes Caleb has two genomes we all

2226
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,760
think of it as shango's genome Caleb's

2227
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,760
genome Ryan's genome really we have two

2228
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:59,119
different genomes one genome that we

2229
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:02,840
inherited from the mother and one genome

2230
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:06,198
that we inherited from Dad and any trait

2231
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:08,880
for which those two genetic um

2232
01:38:06,198 --> 01:38:13,039
chromosomes are the same from Mom and

2233
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:15,920
Dad the plant or the person will breed

2234
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:17,279
true any sections of the chromosomes

2235
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,199
where those chromosomes are different

2236
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:21,719
between the

2237
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:22,919
parents in cannabis if we self those

2238
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:24,520
that's where those traits are where we'

2239
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:27,920
SE all the

2240
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:30,480
and really the the degree of genetic

2241
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,480
similarity between the

2242
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:35,319
two mated individuals or the I guess

2243
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:37,359
we'd call them grandparents at this time

2244
01:38:35,319 --> 01:38:39,920
because we're you know our individual is

2245
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:43,118
an s or is a the individual that we're

2246
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:45,079
selfing is creating the

2247
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:48,079
grandchildren's like the grandchildren

2248
01:38:45,079 --> 01:38:49,639
generation what we're looking at is the

2249
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:53,639
chromosomes that were inherited from

2250
01:38:49,639 --> 01:38:56,760
grandmother and grandfather right

2251
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:59,639
so yeah it's uh there's no there's no

2252
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,960
easy answers yeah right on like it's it

2253
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:03,639
really is

2254
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:06,639
like quite a complex answer and it just

2255
01:39:03,639 --> 01:39:08,560
begs further questions you know how how

2256
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:11,920
varied is the S1 going to be well how

2257
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:13,320
true breeding is the plant that we're um

2258
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,639
is that we're using to create the S1

2259
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:16,679
generation it's really answering a

2260
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:18,920
question with a question which is never

2261
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:21,158
satisfying right on all right so let's

2262
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:23,440
let's bring this second set uh to a

2263
01:39:21,158 --> 01:39:27,000
close now I've got I got something to

2264
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:31,000

2444
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:53,800
your host Shango Los and my guests today

2445
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:55,599
are Ryan Lee and Caleb in fecta all

2446
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:58,520
right guys let's bring this on home so

2447
01:46:55,599 --> 01:47:02,440
during the first set we talked about uh

2448
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:05,159
s1s and like what they are both from a

2449
01:47:02,439 --> 01:47:07,519
scientific perspective and also from a

2450
01:47:05,158 --> 01:47:09,960
usability and and what we're doing with

2451
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:12,880
them in the Cannabis Community Direction

2452
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:17,439
and then in the second set um we dug in

2453
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:21,000
deeply to S1 attributes and what we will

2454
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:23,439
see in the genome this set three will be

2455
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,639
a little bit shorter I expect because we

2456
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:29,118
are going to be focusing on the actual

2457
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:32,760
making of s1s which you know is

2458
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:35,158
absolutely a skill but it's not quite as

2459
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,639
lengthy as as some of the other things

2460
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:39,839
that we may do in cannabis and so Caleb

2461
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:42,440
you know since you are the guy who does

2462
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:44,520
this more than anybody I know um I would

2463
01:47:42,439 --> 01:47:48,319
appreciate it if you would take us

2464
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:51,560
through um a stepbystep like tutorial on

2465
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:56,399
how you produce s1's in your garden and

2466
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:59,920
and as as as far as like level of um

2467
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:02,920
detail you know certainly um we have got

2468
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,840
a whole bunch of of ogs who are

2469
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:06,359
listening um who are going to be

2470
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:09,039
familiar with everything that you're

2471
01:48:06,359 --> 01:48:12,039
saying but also recognize that we've got

2472
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:14,880
a whole bunch of new breeders here and

2473
01:48:12,039 --> 01:48:17,599
so um so you know go go through it in a

2474
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:19,359
little more detail than you would if you

2475
01:48:17,599 --> 01:48:21,960
were just sitting around with Ryan

2476
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:23,880
having this conversation all right so U

2477
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,760
so all right cool that said U here I'll

2478
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:31,079
hand you the mic and walk us through it

2479
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:34,840
would you so uh handful of years ago I I

2480
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:37,359
I never really thought about how long it

2481
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:40,319
took a full run of

2482
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:43,399
s1's um but somebody asked you know hey

2483
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:46,599
can you make me you know this S1 and you

2484
01:48:43,399 --> 01:48:49,799
know um so I basically broke it down for

2485
01:48:46,599 --> 01:48:52,840
myself and you know them of course and I

2486
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:57,480
realized that it takes about 6 months

2487
01:48:52,840 --> 01:49:01,960
from start to finish to make one full S1

2488
01:48:57,479 --> 01:49:04,439
run basically uh you pick your pick your

2489
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:07,960
uh you know mother plants one you want a

2490
01:49:04,439 --> 01:49:12,359
S1 and then you got to get your stock up

2491
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:16,079
uh veg them out and you know I mean I I

2492
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:19,799
don't work on a small scale my smallest

2493
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:23,519
uh reversal room is 3K and most of them

2494
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:26,000
are 4K to 6K

2495
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,599
and anyways uh so you know I'm I'm

2496
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,198
filling up a what what what does that

2497
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:33,520
mean dude I don't do you mean like like

2498
01:49:30,198 --> 01:49:36,158
3,000 plants no no no I don't know what

2499
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:39,280
3K means like it's probably my novice

2500
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:42,399
but like what does that mean uh 3,000 to

2501
01:49:39,279 --> 01:49:45,559
6,000 Watts oh Watts okay thank you yeah

2502
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:48,279
so three 3 to 6,000 watt lights you know

2503
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:53,440
per row anyways

2504
01:49:48,279 --> 01:49:55,279
uh so basically uh you know uh veg time

2505
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:59,479
I usually give my plants about two

2506
01:49:55,279 --> 01:50:05,118
months veg um then

2507
01:49:59,479 --> 01:50:08,879
um then uh um I'm also using 8 to

2508
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:12,238
12 uh five gallon plants that are you

2509
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:14,079
know usually about 2T x 2 foot as the

2510
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:23,759
you know the reversal

2511
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:28,760
plants um and um I I also uh um do

2512
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:32,920
different uh um different uh variations

2513
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:34,840
on what I spray on them because uh in my

2514
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:38,000
experience not all plants reverse the

2515
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:41,920
same some plants do early some plants do

2516
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:44,238
late um as far as pollen drop so there's

2517
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:47,520
a there's a good bit of variation on

2518
01:50:44,238 --> 01:50:49,198
that um and then

2519
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:53,360
uh

2520
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:55,319
um uh I don't know did i l did I lose

2521
01:50:53,359 --> 01:50:56,639
you there Shango no no I'm listening I'm

2522
01:50:55,319 --> 01:51:00,639
just I'm just you've got the floor

2523
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:04,760
that's all okay okay

2524
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:06,520
um so uh you know some some plants uh

2525
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:09,000
you know they'll drop pollen as early as

2526
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:11,719
like week three others will drop pollen

2527
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:15,479
you know week six um so I basically have

2528
01:51:11,719 --> 01:51:19,399
to spray some plants you know two weeks

2529
01:51:15,479 --> 01:51:22,238
before um you know the the rest of them

2530
01:51:19,399 --> 01:51:23,078
and others you know um right right at

2531
01:51:22,238 --> 01:51:25,439
the TRU

2532
01:51:23,078 --> 01:51:28,399
of the the regular

2533
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:30,879
Garden um for folks who aren't for folks

2534
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:32,638
who aren't um as familiar with the spray

2535
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,118
process what is it that you are spraying

2536
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:38,800
and where where do you what do you like

2537
01:51:34,118 --> 01:51:41,439
to use um I generally use exe um I also

2538
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:45,639
use uh STS based

2539
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:48,799
products um you know um but generally uh

2540
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:50,319
lately it's it's been exe from

2541
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:54,079
hyber

2542
01:51:50,319 --> 01:51:56,840
um and uh

2543
01:51:54,078 --> 01:52:00,158
um yeah I mean you know the results are

2544
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:03,920
still variable uh a a lot of a lot of

2545
01:52:00,158 --> 01:52:07,719
plants um don't don't reverse with just

2546
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:11,399
one spray whether you're using exe or

2547
01:52:07,719 --> 01:52:15,198
STS um so you know I always make sure I

2548
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:16,559
I spray uh two times to at least half

2549
01:52:15,198 --> 01:52:18,839
the plants I

2550
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:23,360
reverse

2551
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:25,760
um but uh um usually the the garden's

2552
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:29,799
fully pollinated about four to 5 weeks

2553
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:31,679
into reversing the room which is

2554
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:36,360
anywhere from

2555
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:39,599
four uh four to seven weeks after the

2556
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:43,238
the rever reversal plants are

2557
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:48,440
sprayed um and then the total time the

2558
01:52:43,238 --> 01:52:51,399
rooms take is generally 11 to 14 weeks

2559
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:54,198
uh you know from start to finish as far

2560
01:52:51,399 --> 01:52:56,679
as producing the seeds cuz I generally

2561
01:52:54,198 --> 01:52:57,759
try to give them six to8 weeks uh for

2562
01:52:56,679 --> 01:53:02,279
the seeds to

2563
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:05,400
ripen um and then uh

2564
01:53:02,279 --> 01:53:07,519
um and then of course the drying process

2565
01:53:05,399 --> 01:53:10,439
uh you know gener generally takes a

2566
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:12,880
couple few weeks as well and uh the

2567
01:53:10,439 --> 01:53:15,638
grinding uh grinding of the flowers and

2568
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:21,199
the separating and the blowing of the

2569
01:53:15,639 --> 01:53:23,639
seeds etc etc um so uh yeah it it it

2570
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:24,439
takes a good six months to produce just

2571
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:29,840
one

2572
01:53:24,439 --> 01:53:32,279
run of S1 and you know feminized hybrid

2573
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:34,039
seed how many different rooms are you

2574
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:36,960
generally working on at the same time

2575
01:53:34,039 --> 01:53:41,319
cuz like you know you you drop these s1s

2576
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:45,840
pretty regularly I I for the last couple

2577
01:53:41,319 --> 01:53:48,198
of years I've had seven rooms um that I

2578
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm working

2579
01:53:48,198 --> 01:53:54,158
constantly um so I'm I I harvest these

2580
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,399
rooms one day and I replant them the

2581
01:53:54,158 --> 01:54:00,759
next day um so it's it's pretty much

2582
01:53:57,399 --> 01:54:04,519
constant um I'm actually trying I'm I'm

2583
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:07,119
working on uh slimming it down a bit uh

2584
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:11,239
because yeah I've I've just been

2585
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:13,799
non-stop in the garden for way too long

2586
01:54:11,238 --> 01:54:16,879
so for any listeners who are like

2587
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:21,159
unfamiliar with using these the STS

2588
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:23,118
spray on um on plants to to cause them

2589
01:54:21,158 --> 01:54:25,598
to um

2590
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:29,198
um self-pollinate I encourage you to go

2591
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:32,480
back to both shaping Fire episode 49

2592
01:54:29,198 --> 01:54:35,039
that Caleb was on before all about um

2593
01:54:32,479 --> 01:54:37,799
feminized seeds and making them and then

2594
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:40,238
also we hit it up again last time Ryan

2595
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:41,960
was on the show um actually not the last

2596
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:46,718
time but an earlier time which is

2597
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:48,599
episode 64 on female breeding so we're

2598
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:51,399
not going to go into it too much heavier

2599
01:54:48,599 --> 01:54:53,920
today but but if you're if you want to

2600
01:54:51,399 --> 01:54:56,078
get more nerdy about um spraying the

2601
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:59,199
plants um that's where you can find out

2602
01:54:56,078 --> 01:55:04,238
more so so Caleb it sounds to me

2603
01:54:59,198 --> 01:55:08,719
listening to you um describe the process

2604
01:55:04,238 --> 01:55:09,879
that the keys to making s1s Falls in um

2605
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:13,000
number

2606
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:16,319
one understanding the recipe and making

2607
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:20,158
sure that you do each step in order and

2608
01:55:16,319 --> 01:55:22,920
properly right and then second the the

2609
01:55:20,158 --> 01:55:25,759
part that has the most bearing on the

2610
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:29,560
seeds is actually the choices that you

2611
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:33,679
make in Plants before you even

2612
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:37,280
start right right and I mean uh the way

2613
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:41,520
I do things it's not perfect uh just

2614
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:44,118
because when I do a run um I don't most

2615
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,960
of the time I don't have backups so if

2616
01:55:44,118 --> 01:55:50,118
something doesn't produce

2617
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:52,960
pollen um or you know doesn't reverse

2618
01:55:50,118 --> 01:55:55,559
properly I pretty much lose lose that

2619
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:59,560
full run

2620
01:55:55,560 --> 01:56:03,320
um and uh a a lot of times reversals

2621
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:05,719
aren't consistent um you know I I I

2622
01:56:03,319 --> 01:56:08,039
generally spray 8 to 12 you know of

2623
01:56:05,719 --> 01:56:12,599
these you know good siiz plants every

2624
01:56:08,039 --> 01:56:14,960
time and uh a lot of times you'll have

2625
01:56:12,599 --> 01:56:18,119
one or two plants that dump pollen real

2626
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:20,399
good and you'll have some that just dump

2627
01:56:18,118 --> 01:56:23,078
a little and some that don't dump at all

2628
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:25,359
so if somebody's going in and thinking

2629
01:56:23,078 --> 01:56:27,880
they're going to reverse X Y or Z and

2630
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:32,439
they only have one plant well it might

2631
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:35,039
reverse or it might not at all you know

2632
01:56:32,439 --> 01:56:39,439
um that's why I try to hedge my bets and

2633
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:42,198
you know uh spray a good amount of them

2634
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:43,519
and you know give them you know a

2635
01:56:42,198 --> 01:56:47,399
handful of

2636
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:50,840
different uh you know multiple Springs

2637
01:56:47,399 --> 01:56:53,238
uh and then you know different times

2638
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:54,920
when they're introduced you know

2639
01:56:53,238 --> 01:57:00,399
into the

2640
01:56:54,920 --> 01:57:03,599
uh um you know into their and

2641
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:06,238
sprayed so you'll you'll stagger

2642
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:09,679
plants for pollen production being

2643
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:12,078
introduced over times and you also buy

2644
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:16,199
how much they get sprayed as well yeah

2645
01:57:12,078 --> 01:57:18,799
yeah yeah I'll I'll generally uh um put

2646
01:57:16,198 --> 01:57:21,039
put in uh I I'll generally try to

2647
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:23,679
reverse plants two weeks before the main

2648
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:25,840
room um and then one week before the

2649
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:29,359
main room and then the day of the main

2650
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:31,440
room right and then I'll also the day of

2651
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:34,799
the main room I'll do a second

2652
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:38,678
spray um on about half of the plants

2653
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:40,440
from each each you know gotcha yeah it's

2654
01:57:38,679 --> 01:57:42,239
kind of a shotgun approach so you're all

2655
01:57:40,439 --> 01:57:45,638
like okay I don't know the particular

2656
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:49,678
best practice for this individual plant

2657
01:57:45,639 --> 01:57:51,800
and so um I'm going to spread out my

2658
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:53,880
window for when I spray and then I'm

2659
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:56,960
going to and I'm to spread out my volume

2660
01:57:53,880 --> 01:58:00,000
for how much I spray right because you

2661
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:02,319
know I've I've had you know runs where

2662
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,439
the the pollen drops before you even

2663
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:06,158
have any flowers and then I've had runs

2664
01:58:04,439 --> 01:58:07,960
where hell the plants are practically

2665
01:58:06,158 --> 01:58:10,198
ripening up and they're not going to

2666
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:13,719
make any seed uh because the pollen

2667
01:58:10,198 --> 01:58:16,158
drops so late like uh OG kushes tend to

2668
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:18,000
lean towards that that that end of the

2669
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:20,799
spectrum where the other side like train

2670
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:24,399
wreck and meno purple you know they tend

2671
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:25,880
to drop the pollen real early so you

2672
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:28,920
know you don't even have flowers to

2673
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:31,679
pollinate it's like slow

2674
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:34,440
down I imagine that there isn't one but

2675
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:36,560
it's worth asking when you are looking

2676
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:39,319
for candidates that you are going to

2677
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:41,880
reverse have you determine that there's

2678
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:43,679
any kind of a signal or a sign which

2679
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:46,118
plants are going to be more successful

2680
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:48,039
reversing than others or is it is it

2681
01:58:46,118 --> 01:58:49,839
something that's hidden in the jeans for

2682
01:58:48,039 --> 01:58:53,800
you and you just can't tell by looking

2683
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:57,639
or seeing how they act uhhuh I mean I I

2684
01:58:53,800 --> 01:59:00,920
haven't seen any type of a

2685
01:58:57,639 --> 01:59:03,078
sign uh yeah yeah that would be awfully

2686
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:05,599
convenient though wouldn't it well like

2687
01:59:03,078 --> 01:59:08,519
like uh for example

2688
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:11,239
um uh Sour Diesel most people who've

2689
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:13,079
tried to reverse that you know have you

2690
01:59:11,238 --> 01:59:16,839
know most people don't

2691
01:59:13,078 --> 01:59:19,238
succeed um even though that you know

2692
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:22,560
Sour Diesel in general you know it'll

2693
01:59:19,238 --> 01:59:24,919
it'll hermaphrodite pretty good you know

2694
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,920
uh no questions asked but uh I don't

2695
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:30,760
think the pollen is too viable most of

2696
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:34,440
that time so uh you know uh look looking

2697
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:36,480
for plants that Herm isn't necessarily a

2698
01:59:34,439 --> 01:59:37,638
good sign for you know plants that will

2699
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:39,718
reverse

2700
01:59:37,639 --> 01:59:41,078
successfully you know kind of a little

2701
01:59:39,719 --> 01:59:46,760
tangent

2702
01:59:41,078 --> 01:59:48,759
there um uh as far as um like what the

2703
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:51,599
so so you you you

2704
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:54,880
do different timings of when you spray

2705
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:59,119
and different volumes of when you spray

2706
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:01,199
if there was a center of that Target um

2707
01:59:59,118 --> 02:00:04,920
where you would recommend that most

2708
02:00:01,198 --> 02:00:07,919
people start like meaning where in the

2709
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:10,639
Pro where in the in the life cycle and

2710
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:13,118
and how much spray what would you say

2711
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:14,560
would be like the center of that Target

2712
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:18,279
for somebody who's trying to do this for

2713
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:21,119
the first time in general uh reversing

2714
02:00:18,279 --> 02:00:22,559
your plants two weeks before is probably

2715
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:24,960
the best bet

2716
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:29,360
and then two weeks before they start to

2717
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:32,158
flower uh no two week you reverse uh you

2718
02:00:29,359 --> 02:00:36,598
you spray your plant and you you start

2719
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:39,319
flowering it two weeks before you uh you

2720
02:00:36,599 --> 02:00:43,520
know flow the target plant or the target

2721
02:00:39,319 --> 02:00:46,599
room got oh got it yeah so um and then

2722
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:49,320
uh the best one generally for me is when

2723
02:00:46,599 --> 02:00:51,599
I when I spray you know two weeks before

2724
02:00:49,319 --> 02:00:54,599
and then also when I flip the room I

2725
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:57,599
spray it again usually with like a half

2726
02:00:54,599 --> 02:01:00,000
strength dose so it's not to you know

2727
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:03,360
hurt the plants too much but just to

2728
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:09,319
kind of make sure you know the the

2729
02:01:03,359 --> 02:01:11,679
ethylene is uh you know um you know kept

2730
02:01:09,319 --> 02:01:12,960
kept down or whatever what do you mean

2731
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:17,279
by hurt the

2732
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:21,920
plants uh lot of times when you use uh

2733
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:24,198
well exe for example uh it it'll it'll

2734
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:27,158
cook your plants up pretty good and

2735
02:01:24,198 --> 02:01:29,158
it'll do you mean like um put them on PA

2736
02:01:27,158 --> 02:01:31,238
like um when you say cook them up do you

2737
02:01:29,158 --> 02:01:33,000
mean like you're actually seeing like

2738
02:01:31,238 --> 02:01:36,678
chemical burns on the outside of the

2739
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:39,920
plant oh yeah oh yeah chemical burns uh

2740
02:01:36,679 --> 02:01:43,880
wow um kind of just crinkled up just you

2741
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:45,399
know twisted up foil foilage uh you know

2742
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:48,520
I've never actually pictured this as

2743
02:01:45,399 --> 02:01:50,279
being such a rough um rough process on

2744
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:52,520
the plant but I'm actually getting a

2745
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:54,679
really different picture now it can be

2746
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:58,079
it sounds like it can can be traumatic

2747
02:01:54,679 --> 02:01:59,800
with some individual plants oh well yeah

2748
02:01:58,078 --> 02:02:03,439
yeah yeah very much

2749
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:06,119
so yeah yeah all right um do you find

2750
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:08,559
that the when you're doing this that the

2751
02:02:06,118 --> 02:02:10,960
uh the seeds take any longer to form or

2752
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:13,079
to set or you know for people who have

2753
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:14,960
just you know pollen chucked before they

2754
02:02:13,078 --> 02:02:19,439
kind of General have have an idea how

2755
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:22,480
long this takes um once the once the

2756
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:24,598
reversing process is completed it is the

2757
02:02:22,479 --> 02:02:26,479
seed ripening and removal process is

2758
02:02:24,599 --> 02:02:29,000
that all the same as we'd see with like

2759
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:31,198
just regular photo plants yeah it's

2760
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,960
pretty standard uh you know I generally

2761
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:38,759
let them go six to eight weeks um six on

2762
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:41,279
the minimum um and uh it's it's it's

2763
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:44,400
pretty standard um as far as just

2764
02:02:41,279 --> 02:02:47,238
whether it's s1's feminized or or

2765
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:50,519
regular runs so so I guess I want to

2766
02:02:47,238 --> 02:02:53,559
name check a bunch of stuff too um Caleb

2767
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:54,760
CU um you know you have reversed so many

2768
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:56,639
and you've already made some like kind

2769
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:57,880
of jokes about plants that are easier or

2770
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:00,159
harder to

2771
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:02,159
reverse um will you just kind of like

2772
02:03:00,158 --> 02:03:03,759
you know go through your head and and

2773
02:03:02,158 --> 02:03:06,000
tell us a handful of the plants that you

2774
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:08,520
find that are are easier to reverse and

2775
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,198
some that are harder um for people who

2776
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:13,000
are looking to attempt this that might

2777
02:03:10,198 --> 02:03:16,158
kind of inform their decision about what

2778
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:19,880
they want to try yeah um lemon party was

2779
02:03:16,158 --> 02:03:22,000
very easy uh chem chem dog number one

2780
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:25,599
was very easy

2781
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:29,880
uh stuff like um B basically those ones

2782
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:31,960
the easy ones uh you know those almost

2783
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:33,800
are like having a mail in your room

2784
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:35,800
where just put them in front of the fan

2785
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:39,440
and the fan blows the pollen all over

2786
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:41,920
the room those are more of the rare rare

2787
02:03:39,439 --> 02:03:45,638
exceptions um some of the harder ones

2788
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:49,719
would be like triangle Kush um Irene

2789
02:03:45,639 --> 02:03:52,118
Skittles um being extreme examples where

2790
02:03:49,719 --> 02:03:53,719
you basically have to kind of collect

2791
02:03:52,118 --> 02:03:57,759
the pollen

2792
02:03:53,719 --> 02:03:59,239
individually and just manually pollinate

2793
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:03,360
everything in the

2794
02:03:59,238 --> 02:04:05,799
room um so yeah those those ones

2795
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:10,359
definitely take a lot of work

2796
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:12,079
comparatively um and I don't know uh

2797
02:04:10,359 --> 02:04:15,198
there's definitely been some anomalies

2798
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:19,880
like you know uh for example with Irene

2799
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:22,519
you know uh um I pollinated a you know

2800
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:25,679
uh the better part of a a full light

2801
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:29,280
um of Irene maybe it was just half a

2802
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:31,599
light um but uh you know I I I put you

2803
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:35,920
know a good amount of pollen on that and

2804
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:38,400
I got 20 seeds you know um but then

2805
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:41,199
there was a you know a row of triangle

2806
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:44,158
Kush right next to him in the other bed

2807
02:04:41,198 --> 02:04:48,799
you know under the other light

2808
02:04:44,158 --> 02:04:50,519
and there was like 750 seeds from just

2809
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:55,079
you know the excess of pollen that i'

2810
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:57,360
had blown on the Irene so it was almost

2811
02:04:55,078 --> 02:05:00,439
like the Irene didn't take its own

2812
02:04:57,359 --> 02:05:01,839
pollen or something whereas the you know

2813
02:05:00,439 --> 02:05:05,919
the hybrids with the

2814
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:07,599
TK actually you know Pro produce seed

2815
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:11,000
with that same exact

2816
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:14,880
pollen um so there's all kinds of

2817
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:16,279
different variables and uh it sounds

2818
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:19,118
like what we want to need to pass on to

2819
02:05:16,279 --> 02:05:21,319
anybody doing this for the first time is

2820
02:05:19,118 --> 02:05:24,439
if you run into challenges and obstacles

2821
02:05:21,319 --> 02:05:26,439
take it easy on yourself because this is

2822
02:05:24,439 --> 02:05:28,279
this sounds like this is this is not

2823
02:05:26,439 --> 02:05:32,279
just point and shoot this sounds like

2824
02:05:28,279 --> 02:05:37,759
there is a lot of um Hassle and needed

2825
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:40,399
experience and Hell luck right um and

2826
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:43,360
also you know uh uh there's a good

2827
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:45,359
handful of plants that you know uh

2828
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:47,598
they'll revert back to just normal

2829
02:05:45,359 --> 02:05:50,960
flower especially if you only spray them

2830
02:05:47,599 --> 02:05:52,159
one time um but even sometimes when you

2831
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:55,158
spray them twice

2832
02:05:52,158 --> 02:05:58,198
it just won't reverse well um others

2833
02:05:55,158 --> 02:06:01,039
will reverse 100%

2834
02:05:58,198 --> 02:06:04,399
And then they won't they won't have any

2835
02:06:01,039 --> 02:06:07,439
pollen at all in them you know um it

2836
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:11,039
it's it's really inconsistent it's not

2837
02:06:07,439 --> 02:06:15,719
just like you say point and shoot it's

2838
02:06:11,039 --> 02:06:18,559
it It's tricky sometimes right on so so

2839
02:06:15,719 --> 02:06:21,960
um to kind of wrap wrap up our

2840
02:06:18,559 --> 02:06:23,880
discussion for today um uh Ryan I want

2841
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:26,319
to I want to get something very specific

2842
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:28,159
from you that you said during our our

2843
02:06:26,319 --> 02:06:30,719
last time when we talked about female

2844
02:06:28,158 --> 02:06:32,879
breeding we've already you know as far

2845
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:36,439
as like the T the two things that are

2846
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:40,520
most often said about um about

2847
02:06:36,439 --> 02:06:43,879
s1's um uh the the the the first one

2848
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:46,280
being like Oh s1's are clones of of the

2849
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:48,400
parent plant and we have very

2850
02:06:46,279 --> 02:06:51,118
effectively dispelled that during

2851
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:54,238
today's show um the second thing though

2852
02:06:51,118 --> 02:06:57,039
is because s1s are female seeds you get

2853
02:06:54,238 --> 02:06:59,638
a lot of people saying um you know

2854
02:06:57,039 --> 02:07:02,039
incorrectly calling it herming you know

2855
02:06:59,639 --> 02:07:05,118
that that all these these these femin

2856
02:07:02,039 --> 02:07:07,920
seeds Herm would you share your thoughts

2857
02:07:05,118 --> 02:07:10,719
on the expectation that fem seeds will

2858
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:12,800
throw male flowers because you've got a

2859
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:15,480
you've got a very strident and

2860
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:19,639
scientifically based opinion on the

2861
02:07:15,479 --> 02:07:22,000
likelihood for for feminized seeds to

2862
02:07:19,639 --> 02:07:26,199
throw male followers or or show interex

2863
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:29,198
traits and so so please drop that on

2864
02:07:26,198 --> 02:07:31,759
us yeah well again I think a lot of

2865
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:33,118
these expectations come from you know

2866
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:36,679
where we've come from in the Cannabis

2867
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:38,158
community over the last 30 years when

2868
02:07:36,679 --> 02:07:40,760
I'm going to use air quotes around the

2869
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:42,118
word feminized when feminized seeds were

2870
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:45,320
first

2871
02:07:42,118 --> 02:07:47,399
introduced to the Cannabis industry and

2872
02:07:45,319 --> 02:07:50,359
I should probably state that that no

2873
02:07:47,399 --> 02:07:52,279
other industry uses air quote you know

2874
02:07:50,359 --> 02:07:54,519
feminized seed this is really a

2875
02:07:52,279 --> 02:07:57,000
marketing thing that has been done

2876
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:59,159
directed at at cannabis

2877
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:01,319
consumers

2878
02:07:59,158 --> 02:08:03,519
um when they were first introduced to

2879
02:08:01,319 --> 02:08:06,759
the market the way that they were

2880
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:08,920
made I would say I in my it's my opinion

2881
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:11,199
that the way that they were made led to

2882
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:14,399
an increased level of intersexuality in

2883
02:08:11,198 --> 02:08:16,678
The Offspring and so I wouldn't I don't

2884
02:08:14,399 --> 02:08:19,679
know if I would call them true

2885
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:22,000
s1s um that were made using a chemical

2886
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:23,840
inhibitor a chemical hormone inhibitor

2887
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,279
which is what what we've been talking

2888
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:29,679
about today there's other ways to do the

2889
02:08:26,279 --> 02:08:32,359
same thing by using plants that are

2890
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:34,158
already intersects and because we have

2891
02:08:32,359 --> 02:08:36,519
this thing in plant breeding all

2892
02:08:34,158 --> 02:08:38,158
breeding really we say like begets like

2893
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:41,320
and that just means

2894
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:43,479
that plants or animals with given traits

2895
02:08:41,319 --> 02:08:45,920
are more The Offspring from

2896
02:08:43,479 --> 02:08:48,399
those animals or plants are more likely

2897
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:50,279
to also have those traits and so if

2898
02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:52,679
we're if we're using parents that have

2899
02:08:50,279 --> 02:08:55,039
some degree of intersect

2900
02:08:52,679 --> 02:08:57,599
um expression or you know what the

2901
02:08:55,039 --> 02:08:59,639
Cannabis Community calls

2902
02:08:57,599 --> 02:09:01,400
hermaphroditism it's also likely that

2903
02:08:59,639 --> 02:09:04,078
The Offspring from those plants will

2904
02:09:01,399 --> 02:09:08,359
have some level of of intersexuality or

2905
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:10,078
her avatism and so I think that what

2906
02:09:08,359 --> 02:09:13,078
what we're what we've seen in the past

2907
02:09:10,078 --> 02:09:17,000
is that some methods of creating femin

2908
02:09:13,078 --> 02:09:19,840
seeds do lead to more intersex plants

2909
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:23,158
the methods that we're talking about

2910
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:26,400
here again will only amplify the traits

2911
02:09:23,158 --> 02:09:28,759
that any given plant have so if we use

2912
02:09:26,399 --> 02:09:31,879
plants that are not likely to be

2913
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:35,320
intersects as the

2914
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:36,800
parents it's more likely that The

2915
02:09:35,319 --> 02:09:39,719
Offspring will also be free from

2916
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:42,079
intersex now that's not always the case

2917
02:09:39,719 --> 02:09:44,078
right I think we're learning through the

2918
02:09:42,078 --> 02:09:46,719
process of more people making female

2919
02:09:44,078 --> 02:09:49,840
female crosses with many more plants in

2920
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:52,599
the Cannabis genan pool that we're

2921
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:55,119
starting to learn that yeah some plants

2922
02:09:52,599 --> 02:09:58,960
for example will have

2923
02:09:55,118 --> 02:10:01,279
strange occurrences with the sexual

2924
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:03,719
expression of of in The Offspring right

2925
02:10:01,279 --> 02:10:07,639
and so I have an example of that I have

2926
02:10:03,719 --> 02:10:09,279
a sour diesel cross you know um Caleb

2927
02:10:07,639 --> 02:10:11,719
was mentioning Sour Diesel earlier and

2928
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:13,519
the problems with using it as a a

2929
02:10:11,719 --> 02:10:16,198
reversal plant I actually used it as a

2930
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:18,800
Target plant in a female female cross so

2931
02:10:16,198 --> 02:10:21,839
it received pollen from a hazy like

2932
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:25,239
plant that I use um and

2933
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:28,480
and a small percentage I'd say probably

2934
02:10:25,238 --> 02:10:31,399
six out of 150 plants so maybe four in

2935
02:10:28,479 --> 02:10:34,078
100 um come up looking like male plants

2936
02:10:31,399 --> 02:10:36,799
they're genetically female but they

2937
02:10:34,078 --> 02:10:38,359
look phenotypically as if they were

2938
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:41,199
males

2939
02:10:38,359 --> 02:10:43,078
um and that doesn't always happen like

2940
02:10:41,198 --> 02:10:45,839
it you know Sour Diesel cross to other

2941
02:10:43,078 --> 02:10:48,039
things doesn't do that so whether it's

2942
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:49,599
like and and the the pollen donor plant

2943
02:10:48,039 --> 02:10:52,399
is also not known to do that I have

2944
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:54,400
selfed plants of that that expression

2945
02:10:52,399 --> 02:10:56,679
that genetic individual and it doesn't

2946
02:10:54,399 --> 02:10:58,879
produce any interex offsprings at all so

2947
02:10:56,679 --> 02:11:00,359
it's something to do with those two

2948
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:02,639
plants coming together and there's a

2949
02:11:00,359 --> 02:11:05,399
genetic phenomenon called

2950
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:07,039
complementation that happens and it's

2951
02:11:05,399 --> 02:11:09,638
usually where there's two genes that are

2952
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:12,158
required for a specific interaction to

2953
02:11:09,639 --> 02:11:14,319
happen and one plant might have one of

2954
02:11:12,158 --> 02:11:16,118
those genes not showing the interaction

2955
02:11:14,319 --> 02:11:18,078
another plant might also not show that

2956
02:11:16,118 --> 02:11:19,920
genetic weirdness but have the other

2957
02:11:18,078 --> 02:11:21,519
Gene and when those two plants are

2958
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:23,760
crossed together a certain substance of

2959
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:25,960
the plants do show that we're in genetic

2960
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:28,199
condition so it could be an example of

2961
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:31,158
that but we're definitely

2962
02:11:28,198 --> 02:11:33,439
learning that I think like Caleb was

2963
02:11:31,158 --> 02:11:36,198
saying you know not every plant reverses

2964
02:11:33,439 --> 02:11:37,598
and produces pollen in the same way I

2965
02:11:36,198 --> 02:11:40,558
think that we're also going to learn in

2966
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:42,159
cannabis that there's going to be

2967
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:43,920
different levels of expectation of

2968
02:11:42,158 --> 02:11:46,679
whether those plants are going to

2969
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:48,599
be will produce intersexuality in The

2970
02:11:46,679 --> 02:11:50,239
Offspring and those are really things

2971
02:11:48,599 --> 02:11:52,639
that we need to do as breeders to Tas

2972
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:54,359
across and ensure that the plants we use

2973
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:57,199
don't end up like that right or don't

2974
02:11:54,359 --> 02:11:59,238
end up contributing within all this

2975
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:02,519
within all this variability it sounds

2976
02:11:59,238 --> 02:12:04,519
like the the rule of thumb to folks

2977
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:07,719
especially folks who don't have the same

2978
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:11,320
scientific depth you're coming from is

2979
02:12:07,719 --> 02:12:15,239
um you know don't don't blame your

2980
02:12:11,319 --> 02:12:18,759
intersex characteristics on on selfing

2981
02:12:15,238 --> 02:12:21,479
or feminization itself blame the inter

2982
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:25,000
sexing on traits that appear in the

2983
02:12:21,479 --> 02:12:27,718
parent plants and be sure you've got

2984
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,559
quality genetics that you start

2985
02:12:27,719 --> 02:12:33,399
with yeah and even if they're not you

2986
02:12:30,559 --> 02:12:35,760
know I mean quality or not is really

2987
02:12:33,399 --> 02:12:37,479
subjective right and so we might have a

2988
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:38,239
plant that has like it's incredible in

2989
02:12:37,479 --> 02:12:40,638
all

2990
02:12:38,238 --> 02:12:42,519
other all other characteristics but it

2991
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:44,239
has a little bit of intersexuality and

2992
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:46,199
and through selfing that plant it's like

2993
02:12:44,238 --> 02:12:48,399
I talked about earlier the only way out

2994
02:12:46,198 --> 02:12:50,479
is through it might be the case where we

2995
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:52,039
cross um a plant with some slight

2996
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:54,118
intersexuality

2997
02:12:52,039 --> 02:12:56,279
and we hunt through the Fe the The

2998
02:12:54,118 --> 02:12:58,399
Offspring and we realize that we find

2999
02:12:56,279 --> 02:13:01,118
plants in The Offspring that don't

3000
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:02,879
actually have that trait remember like

3001
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:05,839
every generation of suling reduces

3002
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:08,800
genetic variability by 25% so we might

3003
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:11,039
be able to through that genu that

3004
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:14,119
reduction of genetic variability we

3005
02:13:11,039 --> 02:13:16,599
might actually remove the negative

3006
02:13:14,118 --> 02:13:18,118
traits in this case inter sexuality that

3007
02:13:16,599 --> 02:13:21,920
we're trying to do a away with and so

3008
02:13:18,118 --> 02:13:24,598
selfing might be a way to advance

3009
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:27,480
removing intersexuality through very

3010
02:13:24,599 --> 02:13:30,400
tight selection for you know strict

3011
02:13:27,479 --> 02:13:33,598
femaleness and and test Crossing those

3012
02:13:30,399 --> 02:13:37,479
those selected individuals right

3013
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:40,159
so again selfing is a Technique we can't

3014
02:13:37,479 --> 02:13:42,959
blame the result on the technique we

3015
02:13:40,158 --> 02:13:45,759
have to understand that the result is a

3016
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:47,920
combination of well the result really

3017
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:50,199
has to do with the genetic Heritage

3018
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:54,078
buried in that offspring that we selfed

3019
02:13:50,198 --> 02:13:56,319
but the technique s is just a tool right

3020
02:13:54,078 --> 02:13:57,558
and I think that we've we have we have

3021
02:13:56,319 --> 02:14:00,479
in the past

3022
02:13:57,559 --> 02:14:03,960
made people have made some conclusions

3023
02:14:00,479 --> 02:14:05,598
that blamed the tool rather than

3024
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:07,840
understanding that the tool was only

3025
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:09,480
revealing what was there that's that's

3026
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:10,480
the sound bite I was looking for dude

3027
02:14:09,479 --> 02:14:13,839
thank

3028
02:14:10,479 --> 02:14:15,799
you that's exactly yeah that's exactly

3029
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:18,480
what I was looking for so all right

3030
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:21,840
let's wrap this up fellas so um so first

3031
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:24,000
of all um thank you to you Ryan for uh

3032
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,239
for for joining me on shaping fire again

3033
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:29,399
it is always uh delightful to have you

3034
02:14:26,238 --> 02:14:32,000
on the show um to have you both you know

3035
02:14:29,399 --> 02:14:34,319
share your humor and charm and like the

3036
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,198
Deep scientific understanding that you

3037
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:39,238
have um that that we enjoy cutting

3038
02:14:37,198 --> 02:14:41,039
through the Bro Science so thank you to

3039
02:14:39,238 --> 02:14:43,118
you and then also thank you as well to

3040
02:14:41,039 --> 02:14:45,319
you Caleb your depth of experience and

3041
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:48,158
knowledge of these Cult of ours that we

3042
02:14:45,319 --> 02:14:50,359
Lo love so much and and your you know

3043
02:14:48,158 --> 02:14:53,399
the fact that you have been doing this

3044
02:14:50,359 --> 02:14:55,639
for so long um means that you're able to

3045
02:14:53,399 --> 02:14:58,000
share with us uh you know experiences

3046
02:14:55,639 --> 02:15:00,279
that we that we're just not going to be

3047
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,679
able to you know probably earn in our

3048
02:15:00,279 --> 02:15:05,399
own lifetimes and so um you know we can

3049
02:15:02,679 --> 02:15:07,279
all we can all lean on your experience

3050
02:15:05,399 --> 02:15:08,679
so thanks to both you fellas for joining

3051
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:12,439
me today on shaping

3052
02:15:08,679 --> 02:15:14,679
fire thank you for having us awesome all

3053
02:15:12,439 --> 02:15:18,519
right so um if you all want to follow up

3054
02:15:14,679 --> 02:15:21,800
more with uh Caleb inspecta from CSI

3055
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:23,679
humble um I recommend these three places

3056
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:27,039
um first of all I highly recommend that

3057
02:15:23,679 --> 02:15:29,920
you go back to shaping Fire episode 49

3058
02:15:27,039 --> 02:15:33,238
on feminization and and and U making

3059
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:36,000
feminized seeds um it's it's a good show

3060
02:15:33,238 --> 02:15:39,519
and it gets into um a bit more of the of

3061
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,840
the details than we did today and then

3062
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:44,079
um and then of course you're going to

3063
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:46,159
want to buy some of Caleb's seeds um and

3064
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:47,399
you know he's got he's got a whole he's
