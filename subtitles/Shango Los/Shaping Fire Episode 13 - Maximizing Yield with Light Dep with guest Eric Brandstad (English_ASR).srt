2
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:11,849
forever and ever the cannabis plant was

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:13,829
only grown outside under the Sun as it

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,109
became increasingly prohibited and then

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,570
demonized totally for the convenience of

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,400
some American politicians cannabis

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,618
farmers had to move to more clandestine

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,989
areas and then eventually indoors under

9
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:27,390
artificial light indoor cannabis

10
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:29,459
cultivators and renegade outdoor farmers

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,679
kept the spirit of cannabis alive during

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,600
those dark years they continued to study

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,058
the botany of the plant sustained its

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,070
medicinal traditions and hybridized its

15
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,949
traits to develop some really amazing

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,000
genetics now that cannabis has been able

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,370
to come out of hiding

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,859
smart commercial growers are blending

19
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:49,459
the power of growing under the Sun with

20
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,808
the best practices of indoor growing

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,509
resulting in greenhouses of all sizes

22
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:57,149
that incorporate light deprivation

23
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,128
technique light DEP is a strategy that

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,870
uses blackout material to cut off

25
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,488
sunlight from the plants in order to

26
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,558
fool them into thinking that it's fall

27
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,390
and they should start to flower even

28
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,609
though it's exceptionally common in many

29
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,069
places now the first you hear of the

30
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:14,430
idea as a grower it's truly mind-blowing

31
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:16,228
if you enjoy hearing frank discussions

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,240

33

him about just that welcome to the show

53
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,539
Eric hey Shango thanks for having me so

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
you know we're obviously going to talk

55
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,439
about light depth today but but let's

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,420
start with the incredible boom in

57
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,340
cannabis greenhouses all over the

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,689
country I know that you're traveling all

59
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,270
over the place setting them up and

60
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,000
consulting with folks what are

61
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,320
you seeing well I'm just seeing

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,569
everybody trying to find their place

63
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,639
right now and it seems like the the

64
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:23,389
shift is really really going towards

65
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:26,509
greenhouses more than ever and so you

66
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:28,219
know I guess 10 11 years ago I mean I

67
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:30,169
started with this company ten years ago

68
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,639
and so it was really stuff and envelopes

69
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:35,209
and trying to show people what really

70
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:37,009
light greenhouses are to the point now

71
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,510
where people you know know what they are

72
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:40,489
and they know what they want to get into

73
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:43,310
they just are fishing around for which

74
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,710
company at this point to to go with and

75
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,689
so the green rush has always been kind

76
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,520
of happening in my eyes you know being

77
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:52,400
on the front lines answering phones and

78
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,990
things like that but it's not quite been

79
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,659
the same kind of rush I guess it's

80
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,640
always been the green green idea for

81
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:01,609
over the years but now it's the full-on

82
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,469
Green rush yeah actually we had dr.

83
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,630
Dominic korva on the show several weeks

84
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:07,609
ago and he said you know everybody says

85
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:08,810
that now that California has legalized

86
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,070
that the green rush is coming to

87
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,810
California he says people don't

88
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,780
understand the green rush started in

89
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,490
California in the 70s has never stopped

90
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,370
he's right and that deed knows what's up

91
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,830
I like him a lot and I can agree with

92
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,539
that sentiment because California really

93
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,780
in my opinion has been the mecca for

94
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:28,489
outdoor cannabis cultivation you know

95
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,159
being up in the Emerald triangle in

96
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,260
Humboldt County and things like that and

97
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,719
so people have always been moving there

98
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:38,030
or moving up to Northern California to

99
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:39,800
you know to get away from something or

100
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,300
just to get up north you know a lot of

101
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,450
people originally when I moved up to

102
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,130
Humboldt in 1992 the majority of people

103
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:47,869
that were there were either loggers are

104
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,840
people that transplanted from Southern

105
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,180
California and so it was still a lot of

106
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,770
tight-knit California people but it was

107
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,379
really a lot of you know most people

108
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,880
that had set up shop in Humboldt back in

109
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,400
the early 90s that had been there a

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,590
while or that were fairly new to the

111
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,680
area where mostly Southern California

112
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,360
people from what I found and now it's to

113
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,069
the point where people are coming from

114
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,050
all over the United States

115
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,609
I mean I've even seen people from other

116
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,500
countries that are you know in

117
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,959
organizations or belong to certain

118
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,120
groups or families or have ties or

119
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,370
whatever that are now you know trying to

120
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,560
be in the Emerald triangle as well and

121
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,379
it's not just the Emerald triangle it's

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,879
California in general now too so as much

123
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:31,219
as the Green Rush used to be Northern

124
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,379
California I think it's safe to say that

125
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,050
it's the generally speak in California

126
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:39,139
is seeing the green rush all the way

127
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,480
around right on and so just so people

128
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,910
don't pigeonhole you is just being doing

129
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,770
green houses in California where around

130
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,150
the country have you been you know let's

131
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,500
say the last six months building out

132
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:49,759
green houses come and say I know that

133
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,569
you're doing lots of work in the new

134
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,310
medical states yeah definitely I mean we

135
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:57,409
have green houses going up as far away

136
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:02,019
from here's Maine so I mean that's

137
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,490
pretty much you know yeah it is and so

138
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:06,228
you know we have green houses going up

139
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,960
in Arizona Maine a lot of the legal

140
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:10,579
states for the most part I wouldn't say

141
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,409
in all of them though I mean I'm still

142
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:14,719
working on some of the other states that

143
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,550
went legal you know and there's other

144
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,260
green house companies to choose from so

145
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,569
it's not just us but we have been

146
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:23,060
advertising nationwide and I do trade

147
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:25,040
shows you know as far away as New York

148
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,949
City we'll do one in Boston this fall

149
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,479
and I speak at a lot of those events as

150
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,009
you know you and I like to meet up at a

151
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:33,500
lot of these events and yes actually

152
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,659
you're probably the number one cannabis

153
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,038
keynote speaker in the country as far as

154
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,780
I'm concerned right now I mean I like

155
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,550
your pitch anyway but I think that I

156
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,859
mean that commonplace of you you're

157
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,930
right because people people want to know

158
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,660
about like depth people are moving away

159
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,079
from indoor and towards you know light

160
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,160
assisted greenhouses or light death and

161
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,599
and you know you're just you're just a

162
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,970
friendly dude who gives a good talk and

163
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
so you know everywhere I go I already

164
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,479
see that you're like giving the keynote

165
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,829
or something yeah yeah it's been fun I

166
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:05,509
mean I I really like to you know I guess

167
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:07,399
speak about the like dev greenhouses in

168
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,870
cannabis production you know first and

169
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,719
foremost and then you know I've been

170
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,699
doing it so long I start to you know get

171
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,410
on a rant about some of the topics or

172
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:18,709
these things going on and I have a lot

173
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,150
of passion behind it and so it's fun you

174
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,680
know I don't mind getting up and talk

175
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,509
and I used to be pretty nerve I still

176
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,699
get really nervous about it let's let's

177
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,899
put it that way but I mean I enjoy

178
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,909
getting out there and getting the

179
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,250
message across and I think people enjoy

180
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,229
you know hearing it sometimes because I

181
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,189
come from a pretty authentic side of

182
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:38,300
things rather than a textbook you know

183
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:40,310
you know possibly

184
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,900
decide you know a lot of dreamers are

185
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,370
going on out there and a lot of people

186
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,948
just getting into the industry and they

187
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,009
do have some credentials but I'm really

188
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:51,110
speaking on a background of 10 11 years

189
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,580
of you know the business history and

190
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,800
then previous to that I was a kid

191
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,859
running around in Humboldt and all these

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,300
other places and so it's turned into

193
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,970
data in some way or another

194
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,470
yeah yeah right on so so let's get let's

195
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,000
get them light in the light depth so I

196
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,729
you know I've got a bunch of questions

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,848
for you you know about you know modern

198
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:12,468
light Deb greenhouses but you know even

199
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,878
though those of us who are already in

200
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:15,889
the industry talk about light def all

201
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,009
the time there are still you know the

202
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:22,069
majority of people don't understand the

203
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,449
idea behind light depth so would you

204
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:25,759
kind of like you know get a little

205
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,650
old-school and talk about the early

206
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,629
techniques for light depth so that when

207
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:32,089
we talk about the greenhouses people

208
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,680
will see oh I see how you you know it

209
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,769
used to be a cardboard box and now it's

210
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,449
a whole building yeah yeah no and you're

211
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:40,728
right there's a lot of people that are

212
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,740
you know into the industry getting into

213
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:44,089
the industry and other states and places

214
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,550
that just aren't familiar with what

215
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,138
we're talking about all the way they

216
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,228
might have heard the terminology but

217
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:55,550
they don't quite know what's going on

218
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:57,379
and so you know like DEP is basically

219
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,879
you know I sometimes like to compare it

220
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,879
to indoor growing a lot of people

221
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,038
understand indoor growing techniques and

222
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,110
you can also look at outdoor growing of

223
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,149
corn let's say when you plant the seed

224
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,740
it doesn't automatically you know give

225
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,478
you a corn you got to wait till the end

226
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,000
of the summer which is the shorter days

227
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,818
when the days naturally get shorter

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,610
cannabis plants and a lot of vegetable

229
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:21,680
crops come into season and so as fall

230
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,778
comes into season we have the harvest

231
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,538
time for a lot of different crops but

232
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:29,240
especially cannabis and years ago people

233
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:31,158
you know if they didn't grow indoors

234
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,680
they had to wait till Mother Nature

235
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:35,778
pulled the trigger so that you could you

236
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,418
know get the flowers and harvest went

237
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:40,250
you know at the end of the season and so

238
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:42,228
in order to beat that cycle or to do

239
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,778
that indoor was one way to do it but the

240
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,759
other way to do it was to you know cover

241
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:48,919
up the greenhouses or cover up the

242
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,740
garden in some way or

243
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:54,349
with a tarp or the earliest methods were

244
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,230
of the cardboard box they called it

245
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,480
black boxing in 1992 when I lived up in

246
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,850
the Humboldt area they'd actually take a

247
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,060
big cardboard box that was the size of a

248
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,860
refrigerator box or a washing washer and

249
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:09,619
dryer and they would individually cover

250
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,009
each plant and the idea was just to go

251
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,919
out in the evening time before it got

252
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:18,529
dark and encouraged darkness so they

253
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,259
were actually forcing the darkness on

254
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:23,149
the plants without waiting for mother

255
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:27,319
nature to do it and so by putting the

256
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:29,120
plants in the dark in June at 5:30 in

257
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,730
the afternoon or whatever time it would

258
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,649
be the plants flowered and so people

259
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,110
would actually be able to harvest before

260
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,000
everyone else but at that time the

261
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,610
product was terrible I mean it really

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,139
was something that you know I don't I

263
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,600
don't think too many people were proud

264
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:46,159
of they quick-dry did it was just not

265
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,200
the best product even though it was

266
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,259
available early when no one else had

267
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,390
anything and so now when we jump

268
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:57,200
lightyears ahead into these greenhouses

269
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:59,449
that you know one can be manually pulled

270
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,550
tarps you know over a hoop house or

271
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,890
something and to the automated version

272
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:06,079
the real goal you know people are able

273
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:08,949
to use these greenhouses and get up to

274
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,560
five harvests a year using the Sun

275
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,390
versus you know just being indoors using

276
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,889
electricity getting the same amount of

277
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:18,529
harvest but the overheads a little

278
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:20,689
higher and then also the outdoor grower

279
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:23,329
that plants the seed or brings out the

280
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,450
clown and it flowers when it flowers due

281
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,720
to mother nature's forces and so with

282
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,970
that being said it doesn't take away

283
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,340
indoor use I mean indoor growers still

284
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,800
are exist with the light greenhouses

285
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:40,009
because in some cases you have to veg

286
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:43,009
the plants and so a lot of people that

287
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:45,830
are new to cannabis in general to plants

288
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,889
grow with 18 hours of sunlight they

289
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,110
won't produce flowers or fruit with that

290
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,569
much sunlight or available light indoors

291
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,659
or outdoors it's only until you cut the

292
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:59,270
lighting back to 12 hours on and off 12

293
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:01,850
hours of light 12 hours of darkness the

294
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:03,649
cannabis plants will flower and

295
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,540
that's really easy to do indoors when

296
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,980
you have a timer but it gets a little

297
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,629
bit more tricky when you're outside

298
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,159
dealing with the Sun because if you

299
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:13,189
don't have enough money for an automated

300
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,409
greenhouse you got to pull some tarps or

301
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,930
manually cover the greenhouses or that

302
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:20,089
outdoor garden and so we've developed

303
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:22,179
ways over the years to help make that

304
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,740
easier a lot of people that are still

305
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:26,689
do-it-yourselfers and then we also offer

306
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,090
the automated greenhouses now that you

307
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,980
can set a timer kind of like the indoor

308
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,410
growers set a timer but we're setting a

309
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,990
timer for our curtains to close because

310
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:37,549
we can't turn off the Sun but we can

311
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,159
choke it out with these light depth

312
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:41,899
curtains and so one of the ways that I

313
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,639
found out a lot of people were new to

314
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,399
this whole experience is I jumped on

315
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,039
another social media site called reddit

316
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,429
recently and did a few posts and it was

317
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,959
amazing how many people had no idea or

318
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:56,239
hadn't heard of it didn't even believe

319
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,420
it was true and so it was it was kind of

320
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,889
it was cool it was fun to be around a

321
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:03,819
lot of people that hadn't had the

322
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:07,929
experience or I've known about it before

323
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:11,180
because it's just that that's how how

324
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:13,669
how small our community is within this

325
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,439
big industry yeah for sure and you know

326
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:16,789
you're talking about different levels of

327
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,430
experience too you got the people who

328
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:22,279
are all new to it who are a blown away

329
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:23,569
by the just the the idea of it yeah and

330
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,610
then they realize that they can get more

331
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,470
than one crop a year which blows their

332
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,330
mind when they start running the numbers

333
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,740
and then you've got folks they would

334
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,210
that have been doing like that but

335
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,430
they've been doing it you know the

336
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,379
back-breaking way where you know you're

337
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:38,959
using tarps and you're hand pulling

338
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:41,720
tarps and you know that works and it's

339
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,790
smart but that's a [ __ ] you know it

340
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,620
isn't it that's the that's the problem

341
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:48,199
with pulling tarps is that it gets very

342
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,730
cumbersome and it gets difficult and so

343
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,110
what people tend to do is try to make

344
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:56,149
gadgets and things and and and make you

345
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,919
know working smarter not harder happen

346
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,949
but there's always pros and cons to all

347
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,719
that and so you know it's not something

348
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,090
I can get into in seminars and

349
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,470
presentations that I go over but you

350
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,910
know there's a lot of people that are

351
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,040
just kind of not putting the layers

352
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:12,409
together properly with these greenhouses

353
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,599
especially in the summer time that

354
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:16,669
causes the product to the either you

355
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,009
not come out how it's supposed to or

356
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:20,659
just isn't as manageable as people

357
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:22,579
wanted to and so then that gives this

358
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:24,198
idea that the only way to do it is with

359
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:26,989
an automated greenhouse if you're going

360
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:29,568
to get into it in a commercial style and

361
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,909
so you know if people have that notion

362
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:34,879
sometimes they're not getting into it

363
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:36,980
and so I do recommend a lot of times

364
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,409
that people do get a basic hoop house

365
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,899
that are just getting into this and get

366
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:44,809
some of the you know easier mechanisms

367
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:46,339
that we offer to pull tarps because and

368
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:48,379
I'm not talking about everybody and all

369
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,870
the investors but to get a good grower

370
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:53,509
to know what they're doing and to really

371
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,750
learn the craft it's not that big of a

372
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:57,980
deal to pull some tarps for two months

373
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,929
totally and you can you can you know

374
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,149
take some of the profits from that extra

375
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:04,129
that extra cycle that you did and you

376
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,539
know you know upgrade your material you

377
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:08,240
know before we get into that dough and

378
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:09,500
what a modern light def a green house

379
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,568
gonna look like let's go to our first

00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,689
you are listening to shaping fire I am

418
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,969
your host Shango louse and I guess this

419
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,460
week is Eric Branstad co-founder of

420
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,810
forever flowering greenhouses so during

421
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,400
the first set we are talking about the

422
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:42,500
history of light DEP and the fact that

423
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,240
you can get more cycles per season if

424
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,490
you're covering up your crop for some of

425
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,560
the time kind of fooling the crop to

426
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,019
think that winter is coming and it needs

427
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,119
to pop up those flowers all of a sudden

428
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,980
but you know most people are thinking

429
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,169
about commercial production and light

430
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,029
depth now and you know there's there's a

431
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:00,589
real range of options you know you can

432
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:03,350
you can get a hoop house and get some

433
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,670
technology to pull it a pull a tarp or

434
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,100
all the way up to having you know a

435
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:09,439
super sexy custom-built greenhouse where

436
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,480
everything is automated Eric would you

437
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,270
kind of like give us an idea of the

438
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,379
range of solutions of light depth so

439
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,000
that different folks can kind of

440
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:20,960
consider what might be the option for

441
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,269
them yeah yeah no problem you know and

442
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,769
we do it yeah there is ranges of ways to

443
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,600
do it I mean originally people were

444
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:27,889
trying to do their outdoor gardens and

445
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,710
so they were just getting a cheap

446
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:33,860
plastic and rigging up some kind of

447
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,990
mechanism wires or you know it became

448
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,120
that's why hoops got popular for light

449
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,850
debt because it was able to hold up a

450
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,190
black tarp and keep it from you know

451
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,139
laying on the plants and then it was

452
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,120
like oh well this hoop is kind of handy

453
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,949
because if it rains I can put a piece of

454
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,250
plastic over it and I'm not going to get

455
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:54,050
my plants rained on and so for a long

456
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,519
time it was kind of like you know a lot

457
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:57,769
of people were just wanting to do light

458
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,079
but then up into the Emerald triangle we

459
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,720
get a lot of rain towards the fall and

460
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,610
so you can get rains that are a week

461
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,009
before harvest even that can be fairly

462
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,809
devastating and so at one point the

463
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,699
greenhouses were popular for the weather

464
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,169
part of it and then people had the

465
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:14,000
greenhouses and we're like oh well I

466
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,650
heard of this light depth thing we could

467
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,099
maybe pull some tarps or do something

468
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,589
like that

469
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,779
and so there became a whole range of

470
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:23,149
people interested in light dip and a lot

471
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,789
of it had to do with budget concerns

472
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,040
maybe the size of the plot of land that

473
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:30,859
they had and so we have little hoop

474
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:33,289
houses that are 16 feet wide and only 12

475
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:35,689
feet long that somebody could have

476
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:38,299
essentially stand on a step ladder and

477
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,890
pull a tarp over the outside of it

478
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:40,669
without really too many gimmicks or

479
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,780
gadgets

480
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:46,400
that same greenhouse can be you know 144

481
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:47,990
feet long and it gets a little bit more

482
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,390
difficult to pull that tarp over the

483
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,279
outside but we do offer some solutions

484
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,730
to make it easier and there's other

485
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,799
companies that make certain mechanisms

486
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,720
that help pull the tarp a little bit but

487
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,639
it's really tricky to get automated ones

488
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,920
because a lot of the automated options

489
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,050
on the really low-tech greenhouse has

490
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,680
become more expensive than the actual

491
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:11,359
frame or the hoop itself so sometimes

492
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,070
you're better off just trying to pull

493
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,750
tarps and a lot of people go well I got

494
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:17,179
to have a life or I don't you know they

495
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,460
have a lot of reasons why they can't do

496
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,470
it and so part of the reasons are is

497
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,230
because people imagine the times they

498
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,380
pull their curtains are much like an

499
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,990
indoor time would be and what I mean by

500
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,420
that is indoor growers typically like to

501
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,339
run their lights at nighttime and so

502
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,470
lights might come on at 7:00 in the

503
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:39,409
evening and turn off at 7:00 in the

504
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,549
morning because the nighttime air is

505
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,870
able to keep things cooler

506
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:46,789
historically it was also the time that

507
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:49,039
PG&amp;E used to come around and read the

508
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,470
meter and so nobody wanted their meters

509
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,659
spinning a hundred miles an hour when

510
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,180
PG&amp;E was looking with their binoculars

511
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,670
from the driveway it's your meter and so

512
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,470
running the lights at night was always

513
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,789
the way to do it and so now we have

514
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,549
people that pull their light depth

515
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:05,869
covers from 7:00 and evening and uncover

516
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,730
at 7:00 in the morning

517
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:09,379
the problem with that is that you've got

518
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,750
to be there at 7:00 every night which

519
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,480
isn't the hugest thing but people have

520
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,829
games and kids and stuff to do and then

521
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,019
there's also the factor that you're

522
00:19:15,829 --> 00:19:20,960
suffocating those plants for 12 hours

523
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,250
under that tarp people used to go out in

524
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,500
the middle of the night and burp the

525
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,990
greenhouses by pulling up the fabric and

526
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,490
letting the hot air kind of escape but

527
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,630
you know that means you got to get up in

528
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,339
the middle of the night and then you got

529
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,980
to be up at 7:00 in the morning and

530
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:36,230
historically when my doing this you know

531
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,900
cannabis growers weren't always up at

532
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,880
7:00 in the morning and so pull

533
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,440
uncovering the tarps it was just there's

534
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,900
I'm not doing it you know it became

535
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,970
really aggravating and the product was

536
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,720
very inferior as well like I was saying

537
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,370
in the earlier segment and so one of the

538
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,870
things I learned along the way was that

539
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:56,209
we can pull our tie

540
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:57,649
harpes according to how much Sun is

541
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,860
available in the morning in the evening

542
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:03,140
and so what I mean by that is that when

543
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:06,079
the Sun comes up in the morning the

544
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,790
plants start to wake up at a different

545
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:11,569
time than when we see the light

546
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:13,099
so our eyes pick up color and things

547
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:15,529
that the plants really don't pick up

548
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:18,259
they don't have eyeballs like we do and

549
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:20,930
so when the plants actually wake up it's

550
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,920
a little bit more light out than than

551
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,410
one would think

552
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,420
and so the best way to gauge that is to

553
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,250
use a light meter and so by going out

554
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,870
with a light meter like a photographer

555
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,259
uses to measure the Lux

556
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:35,149
you can actually sit out in the green

557
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:36,799
out by the garden and early in the

558
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,600
morning before the Sun as the Sun is

559
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,669
coming up and when it registers from

560
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,439
zero to whatever number it could be one

561
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:47,420
or it might jump to 15 you know that

562
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,880
it's light and the plants are awake and

563
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,160
so that at that point we know in 12

564
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,530
hours at time we need to cover those

565
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,300
plants and so a lot of times you know

566
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:59,450
the first lumen at my garden would be

567
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:01,730
525 in the morning and so I had to be at

568
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,009
my garden at 5:25 in the evening to

569
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,110
cover them up because it was 12 hours of

570
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:07,970
light and so a lot of people go but it's

571
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:10,069
still sunny out it's still you know but

572
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,620
tough luck it's 12 hours of light and

573
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm trying to get people to be able to

574
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:16,819
deal with this manual concept and so the

575
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,090
idea is to make sure that you cover them

576
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:22,909
at 5:30 with a white exterior cover 5:25

577
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:24,470
p.m. and the white exterior cover helps

578
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,990
reduce the heat gain that can be

579
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,429
associated with the black tarp a lot of

580
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,769
people would use a black tarp because

581
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:33,380
it's cheaper and easier to find but it

582
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:35,210
encourages more solar gain and that the

583
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,309
last thing we need when we're covering

584
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,700
up a cannabis garden in a greenhouse

585
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:42,678
when it's 525 in the evening but what

586
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,929
that allows you to do is uncover the

587
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,790
plants the minute it's dark and you

588
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:49,940
don't have to be out there again until

589
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:51,859
5:25 the next day and so we're basically

590
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,679
talking about covering the garden at

591
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:56,808
dinnertime and uncovering at bedtime and

592
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,500
you can go out there and look when the

593
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:02,299
last lumen disappears typically that's

594
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,369
before the Sun actually goes down and so

595
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:06,740
I don't need a flashlight to go uncover

596
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,579
my greenhouse because it's not dark

597
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,319
enough for me to

598
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:11,809
see but it's dark enough for the plants

599
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,429
to be asleep and that's a tough pill for

600
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:16,159
people to swallow but it's the truth

601
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:18,259
and if you can go by that regimen a lot

602
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,150
of people are fine but the one thing I

603
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:22,490
would say to that low-tech method and

604
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,740
that idea it's very affordable but you

605
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,500
need to use the greenhouse properly and

606
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,730
so backing up two greenhouses like we

607
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,470
talked about a little bit in the other

608
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,930
segment is that greenhouses were made

609
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,150
for wintertime and then if you think

610
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,470
about that you know that means well we

611
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,930
don't want to use a greenhouse in the

612
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,000
summer and that's partially true because

613
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,490
greenhouses can actually trap too much

614
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,410
air heat up and it makes people have to

615
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,359
do things like turn on fans and maybe

616
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:49,910
want an air conditioner and all these

617
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,919
other things and so a hoop house in my

618
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,750
opinion it gets even more low-tech

619
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,150
because we don't really need exhaust

620
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,069
fans and all these things we can

621
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,560
actually make the greenhouse more of a

622
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:03,409
shelter rather than a greenhouse and so

623
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,690
I like to differentiate summer mode and

624
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,279
winter mode greenhouses as two different

625
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,870
things because the way we run them in

626
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,119
the winter is not how we run them in the

627
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:13,279
summer and so a simple hoop house

628
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,189
doesn't need to have end walls and doors

629
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,259
or fans it can merely just be an open

630
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,180
tunnel and then I like to have the side

631
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:22,369
walls up off the ground at least the

632
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,830
Reta four feet and at that point we're

633
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:26,989
really creating a canopy or a shelter so

634
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:29,269
to speak so that we avoid the solar gain

635
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,099
in the greenhouse effect and then we

636
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:33,019
also use the proper greenhouse cover

637
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:35,389
which is a diffused poly woven

638
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:38,329
greenhouse cover and diffusion high

639
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:40,190
diffusion spreads the light uniformly so

640
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:42,679
that it actually doesn't have hot spots

641
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,620
that causes the plants themselves to

642
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,720
heat up because plant temp and air temp

643
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:49,729
are two different things and so we can

644
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,370
have high air temp and still keep the

645
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,470
plant temps low through this method that

646
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:56,419
I'm talking about and then when we pull

647
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,430
our light that cover at 5:30 in the

648
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,009
evening we don't see the humidity spike

649
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,420
like a lot of the other cases that we

650
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:04,789
hear about because people have been

651
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,160
trapping air too much using too clear of

652
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:09,079
a cover or even using the black ground

653
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,570
cover in black grow bags all those

654
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:13,609
things encourage more surface temps

655
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:15,710
which add more air temps to the

656
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:17,719
greenhouse and so what we want to do is

657
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,390
calm down all these things and use white

658
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,529
ground cover tan grow bags a diffused

659
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,110
greenhouse cut

660
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:26,119
stop trapping air and we're in a summer

661
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:28,219
mode greenhouse and cannabis is gonna go

662
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,419
crazy you're gonna pull your light depth

663
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,630
coverage you're not gonna see the

664
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:35,269
humidity and condensation that everybody

665
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,280
else you know the horror stories that

666
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:38,629
people talk about a lot of times because

667
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,329
they're just not quite putting the

668
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,970
layers together properly and the

669
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:47,210
low-tech version can be very profitable

670
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,400
for people and low overhead and it

671
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,220
actually works for a lot of small craft

672
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,170
farmers and then when we go into the mid

673
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,680
tech greenhouses we're talking about the

674
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:59,120
Gothic shaped greenhouses that can be

675
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,160
manual sidewalls and ridge vent or

676
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,009
automated with an automated blackout

677
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,990
option it can be basic it can be deluxe

678
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:07,640
you know there's a lot of ways to skin

679
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,589
the cat and the Gothic frames we have

680
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,930
and then you know the ultimate

681
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:13,699
greenhouse is the a-frame greenhouses

682
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,680
that really you know when you're looking

683
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,830
at them from the front they straight

684
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,600
sidewalls to a a-frame peak and they can

685
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:22,879
be gutter connected so they create a

686
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:25,429
mega structure and you've got all these

687
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,680
different bays with you know vegging and

688
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:30,380
flowering and and you know they're

689
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,900
really you know commercial like full-on

690
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,160
but they're very expensive and you got

691
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,990
to have the right property and

692
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,940
permitting and all these things whereas

693
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,670
some of these low-tech midtech

694
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,850
greenhouses are fairly affordable at

695
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:46,130
entry-level you can learn the craft you

696
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:48,500
can get a lot done you can pull the same

697
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,780
type of product out of a low tech mid

698
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,670
tech and high tech as long as you follow

699
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:54,769
some of the procedures that I had talked

700
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,900
about and on the mid tech greenhouses

701
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:58,670
like the Gothic you don't have to worry

702
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,470
about stripping it down like we talked

703
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,630
about in the hoop house because the

704
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,460
Gothic frames allow you to have a roof

705
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,530
vent on the top that it goes from one

706
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,230
end to the other that's four feet wide

707
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:10,819
and so you open that roof vent and then

708
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,160
these gothics have six foot tall

709
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:15,079
sidewalls that you can roll up manual or

710
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,090
automated and so when you have a six

711
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,939
foot sidewall rolled up and a roof vent

712
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:22,939
open you can still leave the end walls

713
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,009
on and the doors secure and you have a

714
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,809
lot more flexibility that way and at

715
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:28,940
that point you also have a timer for

716
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:31,159
your curtains and you can basically

717
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,620
throw away the idea that I taught you

718
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,120
about manual light depth and go back to

719
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:37,459
even the seven to seven

720
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,349
that your indoor growers might have been

721
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,569
used to because you get so much Sun at

722
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:43,159
your garden all the way till 7:00 in the

723
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:45,558
evening or whatever then you pull your

724
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,540
curtains and that way your curtains on

725
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,119
these automated systems are breathable

726
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,740
you know we can have the exhaust system

727
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,139
with the light traps we call them

728
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,299
breathable walls over the exhaust fans

729
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,610
and intakes and so even when the

730
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,990
blackout's closed the zone isn't going

731
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:03,079
to heat up because we have all this

732
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:04,579
breathability and you can open the

733
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,379
curtains again at 7:00 in the morning

734
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:10,308
when the greenhouse is practically

735
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:12,440
getting into full Sun and so you know

736
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:14,629
there's the manual mode I guess or

737
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,269
strategy to do it in the summer strategy

738
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:20,179
or the automated strategy to do it but

739
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:21,950
ultimately the goal is the same to avoid

740
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,990
the solar gain in the greenhouse not

741
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:26,960
have significant colors that are

742
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:28,609
encouraged more surface temps and make

743
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,299
sure we use the right greenhouse cover

744
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:35,178
and everything will be great I really

745
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:37,039
like how you you clarify or lay out

746
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:39,259
rather the buffet of options right

747
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,779
because at the very base level I mean

748
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:44,929
you can just use your muscles and and

749
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:47,359
some ANA tarp and boom you are

750
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,920
decreasing the light and you are causing

751
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,599
your plants to flower much earlier in

752
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,539
the season so it's like man you are

753
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,308
doing light DAP yeah but then but then

754
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:58,849
if you wanna and then then upgrade and

755
00:27:55,308 --> 00:28:00,170
start thinking about how much extra heat

756
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:03,259
that you're keeping in your greenhouse

757
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:05,960
and and change you know the color of

758
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:08,029
your pots and and what you're putting on

759
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,279
the ground and and you know allowing

760
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:12,470
more ventilation now you're doing light

761
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:14,450
depth but you're also helping the plants

762
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,610
because you can do you know all these

763
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,950
inexpensive techniques just on color

764
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:21,769
choice of what you purchase that's going

765
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,299
to be helping you not retain this too

766
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:25,700
much heat during the summer so that you

767
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,379
can still do your your light depth in a

768
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,569
greenhouse in the summer without cooking

769
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,520
your plants and then you know if you've

770
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:33,558
got serious investment capital well then

771
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,329
yeah you can step up and and you know

772
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:38,000
maybe get something custom-built

773
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:39,949
where where now you've got all the best

774
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,039
practices worked out together so it just

775
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,569
depends on what your budget is and what

776
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,428
your what you want your experience to be

777
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:47,538
and also you can kind of work your way

778
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:49,070
up right as

779
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:52,940
you're getting more cycles and being

780
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:54,950
able to make more profit off of the the

781
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,749
new cycles that you're having you can

782
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:59,269
take some of that money and reinvest it

783
00:28:56,749 --> 00:29:01,038
and so you know in just a few cycles now

784
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:03,798
you've got a totally sick year-round

785
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,839
greenhouse you're absolutely right about

786
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:07,908
that too because a lot of people call me

787
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,638
and go what should I do or how should we

788
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:12,259
scale up what's the best plan here you

789
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:14,118
know obviously the goal is the mega

790
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:15,979
structure for a lot of these investors

791
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:18,048
but they got plants that are they've

792
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:19,639
already got seeds popping right now and

793
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:23,269
things like that you know and so it's

794
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:25,248
like yeah it's hard to get stuff and

795
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:27,558
build it and have it ready to hand you

796
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:29,419
the keys in the amount of time it takes

797
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,308
for some of these structures or some of

798
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:33,139
these setups might even be that the

799
00:29:31,308 --> 00:29:34,668
property's not ready and the grading has

800
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:37,368
been done and all these other things

801
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:39,288
that don't even have to do with the the

802
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:41,628
manufacturing or the producing of the

803
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:43,429
greenhouse and so a lot of people are

804
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:45,498
also investing in a lot of properties

805
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:47,419
right now that you know need fencing and

806
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:49,639
they need power upgrades and they need

807
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,820
you know they need infrastructure and

808
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:54,738
stuff to even support a greenhouse of

809
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:57,460
processing facility drying rooms and all

810
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:59,989
this stuff and so with that being said

811
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,629
it's pretty easy to get some of these

812
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:04,639
hoop houses and you know for a lack of

813
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:06,978
better terms bang them out real quick

814
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:10,579
and like you're saying you can encourage

815
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:13,159
a couple year you can encourage revenue

816
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:15,228
while all this other master planning is

817
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:17,450
going on and so yeah you might pull

818
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:20,058
tarps for a round or two while the

819
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:22,098
midtech or high-tech greenhouse is being

820
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:23,690
built but it's better than just being

821
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:25,729
sitting in the water you know sitting

822
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,558
dead in the water not doing anything

823
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:29,569
waiting for the mega structure to be

824
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:32,210
built or permitted or whatever it takes

825
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:35,509
and so I see a lot of people with wasted

826
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,598
time and space and and things go by

827
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:40,159
because they are hung up by red tape and

828
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:42,470
the way that they see they want to do it

829
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,960
and a lot of times that's the automated

830
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,970
all the bells and whistles where you

831
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,308
know most growers are fine with the low

832
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,798
tech there's always somebody around that

833
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:53,868
can pull some tarps or you know it easy

834
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:55,819
to hire someone that's strong and can do

835
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:58,608
this type of stuff for a couple months

836
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:00,589
or even a season and that goes also to

837
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,949
the equipment that we buy have a lot of

838
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:02,388
pee

839
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,298
you know we went through a really harsh

840
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:07,219
winter here in California particularly

841
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:09,440
and I think up and down the west coast

842
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,509
for rains and snow and things like that

843
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,370
and one of the things I get a lot of

844
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:15,829
phone calls now that the sun's out we

845
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:17,538
went from zero to a hundred and people

846
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:19,158
are needing greenhouses yesterday and

847
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:22,009
they keep asking me well I need a heater

848
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,809
and by the time a lot of people buy most

849
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:25,759
of these greenhouses and actually get

850
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:27,888
them installed I doubt that they're

851
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,839
gonna turn the heater on much because

852
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:32,569
we're just trending towards spring and

853
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,459
so the other thing people automatically

854
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:35,928
by default want to buy are lights for

855
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,490
the greenhouse and at this point we're

856
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,500
gonna be needing curtains more than

857
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:41,960
we're gonna need lights you can maybe

858
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,730
need lights for vegging but you know a

859
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,669
lot of this equipment people buy and it

860
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,440
stays turned off for four or five months

861
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:50,450
where they could have used that cash for

862
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,100
something else because they're still

863
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,730
growing in that greenhouse and gonna

864
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:57,888
make some cash haha yeah yeah hold that

865
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,740
purchase off until the end of October

866
00:31:57,888 --> 00:32:02,990
after you crop the the natural summer

867
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,339
crop and then buy that stuff with the

868
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,450
revenue that you pulled from the three

869
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,459
cycles that you already have done

870
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,919
correct and that's the thing you know

871
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,778
you we want our heating systems and our

872
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,538
lights to be in the greenhouses and

873
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:16,308
ready let's say by Thanksgiving you know

874
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:18,429
I always say that's a good goal to have

875
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:21,168
and so if you can pop off a round or two

876
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:23,538
before Thanksgiving and whatever it is

877
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:26,000
or even in the in the main greenhouse

878
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:28,519
you can still add the lights and that

879
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,069
heating system during harvest season for

880
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,778
everyone else and that's also kind of

881
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:34,548
the goal of light DEP is to make sure

882
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:37,579
you're not harvesting when everybody

883
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:39,138
else is yeah because if you're if you

884
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:40,668
can if you're able to bring that product

885
00:32:39,138 --> 00:32:43,359
to market first you're gonna get a lot

886
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:46,580
higher price than everybody else who is

887
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:49,308
bringing their product to market at the

888
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:51,528
same time so hey I want to talk a lot

889
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:53,408
more about transitioning to a light DEP

890
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:55,730
situation but let's take another break

891
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:58,070
you are listening to shaping fire and my

892
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,370
guest today is Eric Branstad co-founder

893
00:32:58,069 --> 00:33:03,259
of forever flower and greenhouses as a

894
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:05,599
business owner you are incredibly busy

895
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:07,908
in reality you are responsible for

896
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,859
everything your company does you have so

897
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:11,809
many responsibilities every single day

898
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:12,709
that often you just don't have the time

899
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:14,618
to really

900
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,210
into something as deeply as you'd like

901
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:19,128
you know there is more that you could do

902
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,629
to reach out to new customers and to

903
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:22,519
encourage loyalty and the customers you

904
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:24,439
already have but you certainly don't

905
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,028
have the time and you're not ready to

906
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,179
hire someone full-time for that role

907
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:31,878
either for you I recommend blunt

908
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:34,190
branding blunt branding principles

909
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:36,618
Kirsten Nelson and Anthony Garcia are

910
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,659
focused on improving your bottom line

911
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:40,970
you know most marketing firms are

912
00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:43,190
excited to make your logo packaging and

913
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,169
website very pretty but they leave

914
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,389
responsibility for improving your bottom

915
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:49,759
line up to you they don't want that kind

916
00:33:47,388 --> 00:33:51,378
of responsibility but that is pretty

917
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,499
much the most important part of

918
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:57,109
marketing right Kirsten and Anthony will

919
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:59,149
help you engage new customers funnel

920
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:00,979
them to your point of sale and keep them

921
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:03,558
coming back to you and telling their

922
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,450
friends no doubt this is a paid

923
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:07,700
commercial spot but that does not mean

924
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,889
they bought my opinion I've worked with

925
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,260
blunt branding on three projects now for

926
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:13,460
various clients and every single time

927
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,010
they have done more than they have

928
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,648
promised and over delivered on results I

929
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:21,139
love how they generate new revenue and

930
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:23,750
focus on that as the goal instead of

931
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:26,088
just making me a pretty logo similarly

932
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,918
every friend I've referred them to has

933
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:30,349
come back to thank me and that just does

934
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,908

co-founder of forever flowering

952
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:14,899
greenhouses so in the first set we

953
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,548
explained light death and why it is

954
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,530
totally badass to be able to add

955
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:21,469
multiple cycles to your year instead of

956
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,720
just growing one outdoor and the second

957
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:26,089
set we talked about you know the the

958
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:29,089
variety of technological salut

959
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:30,440
from really simply pulling tarps all the

960
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,809
way up to you know quarter million

961
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,349
dollars sexy fully automatic greenhouses

962
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:38,989
so you know for a lot of people we don't

963
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:41,150
know what the what we don't know what we

964
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:43,489
don't know and moving towards that yes

965
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:45,920
so so so Eric my first question for you

966
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:47,839
is you know because of prohibition lots

967
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,150
of people have been indoors because they

968
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,170
need to be both clandestine and also

969
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,780
they want to control their environment

970
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:55,460
but a lot of these indoor growers you

971
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,350
know they've kind of earned their master

972
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,750
growers stripes and now they're being

973
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:03,049
hired by a commercial company who's

974
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:06,139
going to use a greenhouse so they can

975
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:09,320
start using the Sun more what are some

976
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:12,759
of the hints that you have for indoor

977
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:16,220
growers that are moving to a greenhouse

978
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,080
well you know I mean it kind of falls

979
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:19,669
back to our last segment of getting a

980
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,489
low-tech greenhouse and learning the

981
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,680
craft because you know basically that's

982
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:27,409
what's happening is that we have really

983
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:30,829
great in successful indoor farmers or

984
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:33,230
growers that are put in the place of

985
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:35,719
either consulting or maybe even hired or

986
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,960
they're their own businesses converting

987
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:40,759
to greenhouses because economics and

988
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,340
that's just what's penciling in now for

989
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,040
everybody is not to shut down the indoor

990
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,809
per se but to add greenhouses to it or

991
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,880
even the outdoor isn't working out

992
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:51,920
because we got rained on last year so

993
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,170
either way everybody's circling the

994
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,170
wagons around greenhouses and what I

995
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,909
find has happened from prohibition it's

996
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,340
not just that everybody was indoors

997
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:03,319
because of prohibition and and that's

998
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,329
what we had to do it's that a lot of

999
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,360
books were also written on the craft of

1000
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:10,279
how to grow cannabis indoors and so

1001
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,829
what's happened is is if you think about

1002
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,720
it you know most farmers and families

1003
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:16,429
that have big commercial farms and

1004
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,289
things like that it's a family operation

1005
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:21,769
and it's passed on through generations

1006
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:23,029
or you're married into the family most

1007
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:25,699
of the people that you see growing

1008
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:28,070
cannabis weren't pepper farmers

1009
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:31,189
originally they didn't plan on growing

1010
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:34,420
anything and probably weren't in farming

1011
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:37,309
business whatsoever but cannabis became

1012
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,889
into their life maybe it became legal

1013
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:42,199
you know you know some of us

1014
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:45,469
free legal we just liked cannabis and so

1015
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:47,960
you know one reason or another we we

1016
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:50,028
grew something you know not a lot of

1017
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,068
people were green thumbs is all I'm

1018
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:54,159
saying and cannabis made them become it

1019
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:57,469
and so when you become a green thumb

1020
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:59,268
specific for one crop and you grow it

1021
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:01,068
specifically one way you're probably

1022
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:03,199
gonna read all the books about how to

1023
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:05,298
grow it the best that way and become the

1024
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,699
great farmer or indoor grower that they

1025
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:09,528
become and it's not because they read

1026
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:11,028
all the books also and that's just how

1027
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:12,739
they learned it they read the books to

1028
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:15,409
quantify things and made a lot of

1029
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:17,838
mistakes along the way and you know

1030
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:20,629
learn the craft overall but one of the

1031
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,460
things that is the is a the thread and

1032
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:25,099
all of that or a correlation and all of

1033
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,199
those things is that indoor growers have

1034
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:30,019
parameters and these parameters are

1035
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:32,538
basically you know seventy-five degrees

1036
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:34,848
air temp and let's say thirty five

1037
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:37,760
percent humidity you know that's kind of

1038
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:39,528
a standard parameter for an indoor grow

1039
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,329
room especially a newbie if they were

1040
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:42,710
getting into it you'd say this is the

1041
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:46,700
air temp and you want to keep your

1042
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:48,259
humidity low to avoid PM and bud rot and

1043
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,480
all these things and so yeah we're

1044
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,670
starting to talk about a controlled

1045
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,559
environment and when we talk about a

1046
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,210
controlled environment that's what we're

1047
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,400
talking about we're controlling the

1048
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:00,619
environment the temperature and the

1049
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,798
humidity how often we water the light

1050
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:08,059
levels all these things - one mimic

1051
00:39:03,798 --> 00:39:09,768
Mother Nature and and - to control the

1052
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:12,410
plant because if you don't control

1053
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:14,598
mother nature in that setting let's say

1054
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:16,368
if you don't become Mother Nature you're

1055
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,440
gonna lose control of the plant and how

1056
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:20,390
do you lose control of the plant well if

1057
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,309
it gets too hot not enough water too

1058
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:24,500
much light you know all these little

1059
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:26,690
parameters change the plants get sick

1060
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,639
they take on disease and pests and they

1061
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,460
die or they just you know you don't get

1062
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:34,308
your product so following the parameters

1063
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,349
has always been a safe bet for everybody

1064
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:38,599
along the way and so with that

1065
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:41,390
correlation of those parameters I guess

1066
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,369
you could say people can go okay we're

1067
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:45,048
getting into greenhouses now we want to

1068
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:49,099
bring those parameters with us because

1069
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:52,659
that's how cannabis grows right they go

1070
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:54,519
this is how cannabis grows the only way

1071
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:56,589
and I have people that bring me the

1072
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:59,170
books I have people that email me the

1073
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:01,120
paragraph I have people that come to me

1074
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,510
and say this is how it grows and I go

1075
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,719
yes you're right this is how it grows

1076
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:10,060
indoors right yeah

1077
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:13,779
indoors is the key word it's not how

1078
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:15,820
cannabis grows and so what we have to do

1079
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,440
is retrain these people to realize that

1080
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,750
there's outdoor growers all over the

1081
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,000
United States or Northern California or

1082
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,739
whatever for for a long time that have

1083
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,170
been growing out in the full Sun so they

1084
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:27,609
don't have the same parameters you know

1085
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,740
what I mean you can't tell an outdoor

1086
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:32,289
grower in in California in the

1087
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:34,689
summertime that to turn the outdoor

1088
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:37,710
temperature down to 75 degrees and lower

1089
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:40,480
that humidity you know in July

1090
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:42,159
yeah those plants need to be way more

1091
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,740
rough-and-tumble you know that's that's

1092
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,509
probably where I mean that is where you

1093
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:48,519
know indoor plants especially if they've

1094
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,380
been super hybridized get kind of a

1095
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,610
reputation for being wimps if you take

1096
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,250
them outdoors because they've been

1097
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:56,710
babied like Olympians for so long you

1098
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,750
move on you move them outdoors where oh

1099
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,360
man we had an ex-special a cold night or

1100
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:04,719
oh man we had a freaking hot day you

1101
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,730
know outdoor plants are burly rough and

1102
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,699
ready for that kind of stuff and so your

1103
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,440
parameters can get a lot wider and yes

1104
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:14,319
and from what you said in the second set

1105
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,480
you know it sounds like the the best

1106
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,610
solution for somebody transitioning from

1107
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,349
indoor to maybe maybe just having their

1108
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:25,360
veg indoor and and doing a light depth

1109
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:27,909
cycles outdoors in the greenhouse would

1110
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,820
be to start by just getting yourself a

1111
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:34,269
small hoop house and just pulling that

1112
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:36,820
tarp with your arms and and doing a

1113
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:38,559
cycle or two so you kind of like you

1114
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,600
know get it get it down because you know

1115
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,880
a good indoor grower is going to

1116
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,589
understand the changes in the variables

1117
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,539
really fast you know it's not like

1118
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:49,000
they're like starting over with cannabis

1119
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:51,550
it's just that they're expanding their

1120
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,820
scope of understanding of how she can

1121
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:56,710
grow and then and then after that

1122
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,330
essentially read as much as you can from

1123
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,679
other people that are successfully doing

1124
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:02,500
light depths so that you could make sure

1125
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,940
that your your how your greenhouse

1126
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,108
doesn't get too damn hot during the

1127
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,309
summer yeah correct

1128
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:09,440
I mean a lot of people that are doing

1129
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:10,970
light-up or aren't quite doing it right

1130
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,579
in the sense that you know most of the

1131
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:15,498
people that I talk to I'm actually you

1132
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:17,960
know when they come here to or even call

1133
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:19,338
and ask me about greenhouses you know a

1134
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,039
lot of times they ask me about a

1135
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:23,929
dehumidifier and a cooling system and so

1136
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:26,119
back in the day I used to just go into

1137
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:27,679
my regular typical well here's how we do

1138
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:29,930
it and this kind of thing and one of the

1139
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,639
reasons one of the things that I do now

1140
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:33,679
is I stop and I actually kind of

1141
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,838
interview these people a little bit more

1142
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,399
to get a little more background in the

1143
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:39,078
sense that are you just familiar with

1144
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,298
indoor growing are you just familiar

1145
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:42,950
with outdoor growing maybe it's both

1146
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:45,440
have you been in the light DEP

1147
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:48,259
greenhouse before maybe you have your

1148
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,358
own and maybe you've been to one before

1149
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:52,690
and a lot of times the common thread is

1150
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:55,308
is it gets really hot it gets you know

1151
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:58,249
condensation drips and I have all these

1152
00:42:55,309 --> 00:43:00,200
like situations and so you know I need

1153
00:42:58,248 --> 00:43:02,028
to get a dehumidifier I need to get this

1154
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:04,429
cooling system or backup and get all

1155
00:43:02,028 --> 00:43:07,429
these defaults and it almost gets to be

1156
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:09,618
like the indoor idea in the sense that

1157
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:11,568
we're trying to control this environment

1158
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:14,329
to the sense that we're getting it to

1159
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:16,130
these parameters that might not be

1160
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:18,440
achievable in the greenhouse because

1161
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,730
we're outside and one of the reasons I

1162
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,489
say that is because we don't have

1163
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,409
typical air conditioning systems for

1164
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:26,509
greenhouses an HVAC system really

1165
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:29,598
doesn't work in a greenhouse because

1166
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:31,338
mathematically they can't figure out the

1167
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,670
tonnage when the Sun is bearing down on

1168
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:36,949
something if they a lot of those real

1169
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,599
good AC guys tell you put a shade over

1170
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:41,179
it if you put a canopy you know put it

1171
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:42,650
in the shade I can try to run some calyx

1172
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:44,598
but when the sun's beating down on a

1173
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,940
greenhouse that has a cover that lets

1174
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:49,609
the Sun inside that essentially has

1175
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,730
solar gain they just can't do it and so

1176
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:54,170
even though people try a lot of times

1177
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,630
it's gonna cost them a lot of money and

1178
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,960
remember we got into this too because we

1179
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:02,778
wanted a greenhouse we didn't want a an

1180
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,548
energy house or you know back to the

1181
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:07,608
indoor room we got a greenhouse to go

1182
00:44:04,548 --> 00:44:09,559
green and so let's not add a typical AC

1183
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:11,929
system to it because it's just not gonna

1184
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:13,759
work and cycle off and cost a lot of

1185
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:15,679
money and so then when we talk about

1186
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:18,019
greenhouse cooling systems what's a

1187
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,549
greenhouse cooling system it's a vapid

1188
00:44:18,018 --> 00:44:22,250
of cooling system or other

1189
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,680
also known as a wet wall and basically

1190
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:27,440
that's when water trickles over a pad

1191
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:29,059
much like a swamp cooler and fans are at

1192
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,710
the other end of the greenhouse and the

1193
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:32,690
only entry point is through that pad

1194
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,820
with water trickling through it on the

1195
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,710
other end of the greenhouse and so

1196
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,990
instead of intake louvers you have water

1197
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,550
trickling over a pad we still have the

1198
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:42,649
exhaust fans at the other end of the

1199
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,660
greenhouse water is pulled through that

1200
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:47,000
pad or the the air is pulled through

1201
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:49,039
that pad even though it's got moisture

1202
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,989
you know the first set of plants are

1203
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,969
getting more humidity and more coolly

1204
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:55,069
cooler air than the plants at the other

1205
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:56,839
end of the greenhouse and the other

1206
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,670
thing about evaporative cooling systems

1207
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:01,130
is they only work in places that are

1208
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:02,960
really hot and dry so if you're in the

1209
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:06,140
Emerald triangle and some places in

1210
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,909
Oregon you know the coasts areas you

1211
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:10,219
know upstate New York even or the

1212
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:11,899
Midwest South you know the south you're

1213
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:14,029
not gonna be able to use an evaporative

1214
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,550
cooling system and so the idea that

1215
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,930
you're gonna get to these parameters

1216
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:20,690
just went out the window even further

1217
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:22,609
and so a lot of people have a tough time

1218
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:25,010
swallowing these pills that I'm giving

1219
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:27,050
out and saying that it's best to avoid

1220
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:28,610
the solar gain use the right greenhouse

1221
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:31,340
cover and what I mean avoid the solar

1222
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:33,260
gain I mean don't trap air because if we

1223
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,180
trap air then we have to do something

1224
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,430
about it and so like I said when people

1225
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:39,919
come here to meet with me I usually ask

1226
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:42,139
them about their greenhouse experiences

1227
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,670
from their friends or themselves and a

1228
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,920
lot of times I get down to the nitty

1229
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,930
gritty of okay you've been trapping air

1230
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,059
you've been trying to do something about

1231
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:52,159
it like use exhaust fans or things and

1232
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:54,110
it's not working even evaporative

1233
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,359
cooling system in an area that's got

1234
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:57,860
high relative humidity outside they're

1235
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,210
not getting that temperature drop but

1236
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,789
it's getting way more humid inside

1237
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:03,619
they're using too clear of a cover and

1238
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:04,909
too clear of a cover means you get more

1239
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:07,519
Sun and then the leaf surface

1240
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:09,049
temperature rises when plants heat up

1241
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,360
not just the air temperature when the

1242
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:13,610
plants heat up they have to sweat to

1243
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,170
keep cool and so you can get a plant

1244
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,800
temperature that's higher than the air

1245
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,139
temperature

1246
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,269
or the same temp as the air temp which

1247
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:22,400
is a high air temp and the plants are

1248
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:24,769
sweating to try to keep cool and so the

1249
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,630
greenhouse has become very humid and so

1250
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:29,030
the default of the cooling system isn't

1251
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,619
working or not applicable and then the

1252
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:33,440
other default is to get a dehumidifier

1253
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:35,449
and so those typically don't

1254
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,670
work and some of the real big industrial

1255
00:46:35,449 --> 00:46:39,409
diamond fires that you can get are

1256
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:42,050
pretty expensive and need three-phase

1257
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:45,980
power and so that's why I try to go back

1258
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:47,839
to saying look you know the person

1259
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,400
that's meeting with me or talking to me

1260
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,409
about these things we really got to look

1261
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,300
at what the plant needs not what the

1262
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:55,578
environment needs because we're out here

1263
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,019
like an outdoor grower we're using a

1264
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:59,510
greenhouse that was invented for

1265
00:46:57,019 --> 00:47:02,358
wintertime and we're trapping air

1266
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:04,609
greenhouses are ideally designed to trap

1267
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:07,130
air and have these clear covers to have

1268
00:47:04,608 --> 00:47:08,989
solar gain and heat up the plants and so

1269
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,849
I like to back up and go okay we're

1270
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:13,699
cannabis growers using these apparatuses

1271
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:15,619
in the summertime and so we don't want

1272
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:17,299
to trap air and we don't want to have to

1273
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:19,490
use a bunch of electricity in order to

1274
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,230
mitigate everything and so the best

1275
00:47:19,489 --> 00:47:23,328
policy like I said about in the earlier

1276
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:25,760
segment is to avoid the solar gain and

1277
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:27,980
not trap air and so on hoop houses we're

1278
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,010
leaving the ends off and maybe rolling

1279
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,659
up the sides quite a bit on the Gothic

1280
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:34,760
frames we're having a ridge vent and

1281
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:36,469
rolling up the side walls and even in

1282
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,440
the mega structures you can have double

1283
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:41,269
Ridge vents and things like that to help

1284
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,068
avoid the solar gain and at that point

1285
00:47:41,269 --> 00:47:45,530
we're also using the proper greenhouse

1286
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:48,619
cover to spread the light uniformly

1287
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:50,510
diffused covers and then we're also not

1288
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:52,789
using those encouraging colors that we

1289
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:54,920
use and when people are here visiting me

1290
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:56,539
on site I use my infrared thermometer

1291
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,550
and I have all these things set up on

1292
00:47:56,539 --> 00:48:00,769
site and so if you've watched some of my

1293
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:02,720
live feeds on Instagram and other things

1294
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:04,009
I'll actually go out in the greenhouse

1295
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,108
and I'll shoot the leaf surface

1296
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:08,839
temperature of the plants I'll open the

1297
00:48:06,108 --> 00:48:10,489
door to the greenhouse and within 30

1298
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:13,309
seconds you can see the leaf temperature

1299
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:16,068
drop dramatically and so we can really

1300
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:17,779
see firsthand that air temp and plant

1301
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:20,300
temp are two different things I'll shoot

1302
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,950
the black ground cover or black you know

1303
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,230
swatches that I have in the greenhouse

1304
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:26,118
next to the white swatches and so the

1305
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,230
indoor growers or a lot of the people

1306
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,088
that are trying to learn about the

1307
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,740
greenhouse crafts that have the

1308
00:48:29,088 --> 00:48:33,858
parameters stuck in their mind and this

1309
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:35,719
is how cannabis grows really soften up a

1310
00:48:33,858 --> 00:48:38,269
little bit and start to understand that

1311
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:40,399
yeah there is outdoor growers and they

1312
00:48:38,269 --> 00:48:42,079
do it outside in a hundred degrees and

1313
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,910
then there's this greenhouse thing over

1314
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,890
here and they're saying not to try to

1315
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:47,170
control the environment but to support

1316
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:49,389
the environment

1317
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:52,059
supported is what I like to say by using

1318
00:48:49,389 --> 00:48:54,670
the right things that we've talked about

1319
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:56,440
in colors and so on to really support

1320
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,360
the plant so that we don't have to

1321
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,090
control this environment the environment

1322
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,920
becomes supporting enough that the plant

1323
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:04,829
can grow to its fullest potential and

1324
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,539
not overheat and cause sweat and

1325
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:10,869
humidity and condensation that everybody

1326
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:12,400
always sees with their other setups or

1327
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:14,230
their buddies or the greenhouses they

1328
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,450
got before because if they haven't dealt

1329
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:18,849
with us they've dealt with another

1330
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:21,219
company that really doesn't look out for

1331
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:22,659
cannabis first and foremost or they

1332
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:24,279
maybe know about cannabis and they're

1333
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:27,069
trying to take shortcuts and not have

1334
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,410
people use Ridge vents and cheap plastic

1335
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,750
that lets in too much Sun and at the end

1336
00:49:29,409 --> 00:49:33,909
of the day they're just not getting it

1337
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:35,500
and so I really try to lay it out there

1338
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:37,750
so that people really get what we're

1339
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,460
saying and laying down and it's amazing

1340
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,519
I just was on the phone with a hydro

1341
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:45,070
shop owner that I've known for almost 10

1342
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:47,349
years now and he has his own greenhouse

1343
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:49,750
and he has really never heard what I'm

1344
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:52,299
saying as much as we Punk out as much

1345
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:54,130
content as I put out there I was on the

1346
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,830
phone today and he wheezy rode in on a

1347
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:57,910
couple of things and he was just like oh

1348
00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:00,969
I get it

1349
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:03,339
I get what you're saying and it's it's

1350
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:05,889
you know it's one of those things that I

1351
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:08,230
just keep trying to repeat myself in

1352
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:10,659
creative ways and I'm thankful to use

1353
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,820
Shango for having me on this show to let

1354
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:15,969
me you know spread the same message

1355
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,650
right on right on you know it reminds me

1356
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:20,799
hearing you talk about it it sounds a

1357
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:23,650
lot like like when I talked to tad

1358
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,450
Hussey from from kiss organics he's

1359
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:27,820
always talking about you know building

1360
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:30,039
living soil and and his point is like

1361
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,559
you know don't dump a whole bunch of NPK

1362
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:33,969
you know bottled salts into your soil

1363
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,980
thinking that you're going to give your

1364
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:38,439
plant with your need you know build a

1365
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:40,480
microbe community in the soil so that

1366
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,220
the soil can just be itself and will

1367
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,820
naturally give the plant what the plant

1368
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:45,369
wants

1369
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,470
similarly you seem to be describing the

1370
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:49,299
same kind of environment where listen if

1371
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:51,579
your if your greenhouse is an open

1372
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:54,000
system if your letting the air flow

1373
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:57,549
naturally go if you're if you're not

1374
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,869
retaining heat you don't have to add you

1375
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,730
know in air condition or in a

1376
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:02,380
dehumidifier and all this others

1377
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,869
which is like you know like dumping and

1378
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,338
piqué into your into your soil what

1379
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:09,070
you're suggesting is kind of like you

1380
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:12,309
know probiotics soil but probiotic air

1381
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:15,760
you know it's like letting letting like

1382
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:17,769
letting life be life in the greenhouse

1383
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,700
by thinking about what the plant wants

1384
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:24,039
instead of trying to create a very thin

1385
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:26,289
specified environment it's a much more

1386
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:28,570
natural way to farm it's more affordable

1387
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:31,029
and you can produce some of the most top

1388
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:32,740
shelf products that anybody's ever seen

1389
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:34,900
a lot of people go well if you're

1390
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:37,389
opening the sides or roof you're letting

1391
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:40,000
in bugs bugs don't want to go to this

1392
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:41,769
healthy system bugs go to the plants

1393
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,079
that are yellowing with this nutrient

1394
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:45,849
lock out from too much transpiration a

1395
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,099
lot of people think in the fall it's the

1396
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:50,710
fade and it happens to be nutrient lock

1397
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:53,920
out I mean a lot of people have nutrient

1398
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:55,900
lock out you know even in light depth

1399
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,608
towards the end of the cycle because the

1400
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:00,010
plants are using an extreme amount of

1401
00:51:57,608 --> 00:52:01,598
water to support those flowers and at

1402
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:03,880
the end of the day they've been trapping

1403
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,220
air and the plants really will live they

1404
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,869
do okay in a bollock stress plants you

1405
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:10,179
know cannabis plants especially are

1406
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:12,099
pretty tough but a lot of people go when

1407
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:13,989
I pull my curtains or this happen or the

1408
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:16,780
fog rolled in or this cold night or this

1409
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:18,338
super hot day all hell broke loose well

1410
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:21,220
that's because they were always making

1411
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:23,078
those plants ride at the line and when

1412
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:25,328
that one thing the fluctuation and

1413
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:27,280
farming happened they couldn't deal with

1414
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:29,950
it and it was the nail in the coffin and

1415
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,980
so we just try to avoid riding that line

1416
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:34,838
so that when farming fluctuations happen

1417
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,480
it doesn't become the nail in the coffin

1418
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:39,279
either yeah yeah I hear that

1419
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,900
well hey Eric thank you so much for

1420
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,240
being on the show today I think that we

1421
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,700
did a pretty solid job bringing people

1422
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:48,219
up to speed on how to think about modern

1423
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:50,769
light dabbing and how to get a little

1424
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:52,659
light pep in their life I appreciate you

1425
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:54,940
having me on and if you wouldn't mind I

1426
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:58,000
do want to plug something real quick

1427
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:00,369
yeah go right ahead yeah April 7th here

1428
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,539
in Grass Valley California at our

1429
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:06,940
facility we are having an advanced soil

1430
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:08,769
workshop with a Laningham here and

1431
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,200
another guy from a company called Chris

1432
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:13,250
EV silyl and what they're doing is

1433
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:15,049
Elaine is actually here to learn

1434
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,360
even even though she's the leader in the

1435
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:20,900
soil food web and living soil thing that

1436
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,640
everybody's into nowadays this guy's one

1437
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,710
of their her advisors and he's been

1438
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:28,489
doing this now for two years in cannabis

1439
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:30,260
specific only situations and he wanted

1440
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:32,629
to come host it here because just like

1441
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,930
you saw Django a lot of what I am saying

1442
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:37,550
about the greenhouses is kind of

1443
00:53:34,929 --> 00:53:40,159
symbiotic to what goes on with the soil

1444
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:42,500
and growing in some of this microbiology

1445
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,909
and so we're gonna the three of us are

1446
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,880
coming together here to talk about

1447
00:53:43,909 --> 00:53:48,980
greenhouses he's gonna present all the

1448
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,769
data and info and Alain's here to kind

1449
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:53,690
of quantify and learn herself on all

1450
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:55,489
this info that she hasn't been exposed

1451
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:57,050
to man that's gonna be a real great

1452
00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:58,759
brain trust too because you know I'm

1453
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:02,900
totally with you I believe that the

1454
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:06,230
future of cannabis is probiotic living

1455
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,970
soil techniques matched with light Deb

1456
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,400
greenhouses and it just kind of pulls

1457
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:13,429
everything together in a really healthy

1458
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,309
sustainable way that makes totally kill

1459
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:17,779
or flower and yes that workshop is

1460
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:21,139
you've got all the experts in one place

1461
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:23,510
yeah and so April 7th the tickets are

1462
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:26,210
online at Eventbrite I have a link in my

1463
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:28,460
bio on Instagram forever flowering

1464
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,230
greenhouses one word and if you go to

1465
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:32,300
the link in my bio you can get tickets

1466
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:33,679
the tickets are a little bit you know

1467
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,720
some people might think they're a little

1468
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,669
pricey but this is two years of data

1469
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:39,949
that this dude is revealing and he's not

1470
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:41,900
just giving it out it's kind of like a

1471
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:43,819
Frenchie cannoli workshop in the sense

1472
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,380
that we're having some food we're all

1473
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,420
gonna be hanging out we're gonna be

1474
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,519
crunching some killer data with some

1475
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,559
killer people and so I think it's worth

1476
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:54,110
every penny if you buy early you get a

1477
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:56,659
deal on the tickets and if you wait the

1478
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,370
price goes up a little bit and we'd love

1479
00:54:56,659 --> 00:55:00,889
to have you here Shango too and I can

1480
