1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:05,669
so I feel yeah I've heard about this one

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,460
talk that you give sometimes that's

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,559
called Mean Girls about clicks female

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,389
clicks in the Canada scene and I haven't

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,638
seen this talk and I haven't seen a

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,608
video of it but I'd love to hear about

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:21,868
it what what is the what's your idea of

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:24,689
Mean Girls in the cannabis scene well if

9
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:26,939
you flush back to high school or even

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,509
grade school there was always a bunch of

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,210
girls there's the girls like for the

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,010
cheerleaders they were pretty they had

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,829
everything and then there was only

14
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,530
everyone else the out beers and so I was

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,820
always in the group layout layer and

16
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,799
what I discovered as I was going through

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,058
high school okay I want to be one of

18
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,070
them wouldn't want to be one of them but

19
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:50,488
then once I graduated high school I

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,840
thought great you know I hate high

21
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:54,759
school now I'll go to college it's

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,480
amazing but I what I realized

23
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:57,479
women

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:05,030
it was gonna go downhill from there so

25
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:08,090
one of my first lessons as an adult was

26
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:11,420
don't don't bloom in high school

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:15,228
so now let's fast-forward to cannabis

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,849
and what we have here is everyone's

29
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:18,140
coming into the industry really being

30
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:22,250
everyone's rushing in but there's a

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:25,310
great opportunity for women we are on a

32
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,049
level playing ground we can go in and we

33
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,820
can create something for us there's

34
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:30,859
nothing that there was nothing there to

35
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:32,449
begin with so there's a lot of

36
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:34,429
opportunity and a lot of ways of playing

37
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,100
outside the rules because women are

38
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:40,240
really great about how to think outside

39
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:44,079
of the box we have to think about how to

40
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,429
feed the kids make the house work a job

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,759
do this pickup that so we're really

42
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,830
great about multitasking and coming up

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,709
with ways of making things more

44
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:57,259
efficient so the campus industry is a

45
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:58,909
great thing to go into because if you

46
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,709
were an accountant we just have cannabis

47
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,429
you can be great if you're a chef you

48
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:06,079
become a few chef tour make edibles

49
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,319
business if you ran a great business you

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,479
can run cannabis so but with that many

51
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,030
women in there we're all looking at each

52
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,579
other okay you know how can they help me

53
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,459
how can I help her and we build these

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,980
great communities I have some some

55
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,930
friends that I know our life log in

56
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,479
cannabis and I will know them until I

57
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,719
get to the grave amazing wonderful with

58
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,119
men and women but sometimes you get that

59
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:35,150
high school mentality brought back in

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,920
where it's this is this is my patch no

61
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,090
no you're not no you're not touching

62
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,399
this this is what I gonna do

63
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,370
and I'm not gonna share but I want

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,769
everything that you have because I'm so

65
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,610
amazing so you run into a lot of women

66
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,460
with a very large entitlement and ego

67
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,330
and if you don't give them what you want

68
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,939
they want they become thin the mean girl

69
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,340
they say oh been affiliate she's a [ __ ]

70
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,229
because she just did it that's not gonna

71
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,689
do this and so you're building up

72
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:07,689
already these gangs and cliques

73
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:12,270
you're either pro affiliate or you're

74
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:16,389
anti affiliate and that becomes this

75
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,700
playground mentality of groups in the

76
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:23,859
corners which should not happen because

77
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:26,409
now not only a weak fighting to get a

78
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,840
place a foothold with men we're also

79
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:34,959
fighting amongst ourselves over petty

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:36,909
things how and it is a culture that has

81
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,909
been brought in because women need to

82
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:42,280
this is how we bring each other down we

83
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:45,219
talk about their looks we talk about how

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,590
they're not a nice person we we dragged

85
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:49,300
them down so that we can go higher

86
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,769
there's a Chinese expression called

87
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:57,640
crabs in a box where crabs will never

88
00:03:52,769 --> 00:04:00,159
will are not a community based group of

89
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,988
shellfish because every time one tries

90
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,780
to get out of the bucket another will

91
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:06,789
grab that crab and pull it down so in

92
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,860
cannabis there are groups like this

93
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,959
where they're women that try to get

94
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,340
ahead but other ones pull them down oh

95
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,140
she doesn't deserve it

96
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,720
I deserve as she shouldn't get this

97
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,339
rather than all of us think we all

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,790
deserve it and we need to work together

99
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:27,159
and in my case I think I pissed off a

100
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:30,669
couple of women because I didn't agree

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,730
with their ethos or the way that they

102
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:32,729
were

103
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:37,818
how they were in the industry ken that's

104
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:41,599
me you know that's the one I personal

105
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:44,389
view it's and so what they did was they

106
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:46,188
took it personally and maybe I made it

107
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,610
personal so there's a there was that but

108
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:52,159
ever since then I am now called out as

109
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,598
the mean girl pretty much bunch of

110
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,968
people that's for better or for worse

111
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:58,399
yeah that's okay but that's it's all

112
00:04:55,968 --> 00:05:00,050
it's all high school hijinks and

113
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,138
eventually we'll get past them

114
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,210
we just need to grow up a little bit to

115
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,978
what degree do you think that it is I

116
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:09,079
mean since since you referred to it as

117
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:12,019
Mean Girls so what degree do you think

118
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:16,068
that it's a gender relationship or more

119
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:19,038
that you've got a whole bunch of a type

120
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:22,490
leader type strong-willed independent

121
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:27,139
women who are all in the same field and

122
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,430
so they fall into power blocks just

123
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,079
because of the personality type

124
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,668
regardless of gender yeah and that's the

125
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,430
same for high school you had a whole

126
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:37,549
group of a type girls too who strive to

127
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,709
be at the top of the feeding frenzy and

128
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:44,270
so that whole culture again is brought

129
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:48,109
into cannabis it is I see a lot of it

130
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:50,478
now in cannabis because there are so

131
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,189
many groups who want to take over from

132
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,620
the place of women girl right there's

133
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:58,250
quite a few smaller groups popping up

134
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,959
and they're not working together rather

135
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,908
they're cannibalizing each other

136
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,079
for members I have a group kind of mind

137
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,579
group you don't want to go in that group

138
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,168
cuz I have the better speakers listen s

139
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:09,318
rather than just coming together as a

140
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:13,248
group or abandoning women group and

141
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,139
going into more mentoring groups for

142
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:17,889
women who are coming up rather than

143
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:21,579
bring a speaker in put people together

144
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:24,379
that I would rather see than going it's

145
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:26,748
to a panel see three people here I see

146
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,249
about 45 times already that's not going

147
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:30,139
to give me much value maybe to a new

148
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:30,840
person but to a new person I much rather

149
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,280
have that new

150
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:36,119
to be paired with someone just a little

151
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:38,250
senior to help them through that's how

152
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,199
we combat Mean Girls because a new

153
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,379
person will not know where to go Ravens

154
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,290
I haven't seen very many mentorship

155
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,959
programs for either gender outside of

156
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,569
incubators right clearly that there but

157
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,478
that's mentoring specifically based on

158
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,649
you know VC capital or making money um I

159
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,709
think that a lot of people they don't

160
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,000
want to they don't want to mentor folks

161
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,888
because they're already feels like

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,899
there's too many people in the field and

163
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,870
it's so ultra competitive right that a

164
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,489
lot of people consider their their

165
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,319
business experience in cannabis to be

166
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,699
almost like intellectual property and

167
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,129
they don't want to mentor people do you

168
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,110
see any more of that happening with

169
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,699
women for women cuz I wouldn't see that

170
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,990
stuff cuz I'm a guy I think actually

171
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,959
then you make a really great point

172
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:25,168
because why there are not a lot mentors

173
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,849
it's time everyone some of the bests

174
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:28,288
that we know cultivators improves they

175
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,870
don't they have don't have time to

176
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:33,269
mentor anyone and if they do is more of

177
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,728
to be on a paid consultant side

178
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:38,728
I think women can mentor other women

179
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:40,740
because we there's some up here who can

180
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:43,050
this is not the time but there are a lot

181
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,879
of us who are in middle and lower in the

182
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,879
industry that we can mentor someone just

183
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,740
coming in we do have that time that's

184
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,848
where I can see it I don't I'm you're

185
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:55,650
not asking say a Kevin Joe dree alright

186
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,469
to mentor you because you know he has no

187
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:00,239
time but you can ask maybe another

188
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,130
cultivator who is lower who's just

189
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,340
beginning to who might have time and in

190
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,659
exchange never this is a good this is

191
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,029
what I learned growing up Asian you

192
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,439
never go to a house empty-handed if you

193
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,819
go to someone and someone invites you

194
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,160
into your home and you bring something

195
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,189
so someone offers you help and wants to

196
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,560
mentor you open it up and give them

197
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:21,029
something because it is in appreciation

198
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,098
because the last thing you want is to

199
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,049
have your mentor feel that they're being

200
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,659
taken to grant

201
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:30,020
so you have to be then again open your

202
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,538
heart as they open theirs to you it's a

203
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:37,639
two-way thing well thanks for sharing

204
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:40,610

205
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,918
