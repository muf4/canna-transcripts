1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
hey there so last weekend I was in

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,849
Denver for Indo Expo and I was

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:12,750
moderating a panel of soil science PhDs

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:15,240
and and will drink Q&amp;A I asked them so

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,850
hey what are your thoughts on 24 hour

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,800
light cycle during veg of cannabis

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,510
because you know there's a lot of people

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,980
who argue a lot of different ways online

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,720
about whether or not you have to give

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,210
cannabis plans some dark times so that

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,039
they can have a natural sleep cycle or

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,439
whether or not you can run your plants

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,679
at 24 hours of light and get finished

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,329
with your veg cycle 20% faster right

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,308
over the course of the year you can

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,469
actually put in another cycle in your

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:46,649
garden so there's a big advantage to

18
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,120
that if it is possible so anyway I was

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,520
curious what they would have to say so I

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,729
asked the question and dr. Karuna Chow

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,520
ray who's in R&amp;D at mammoth microbes

22
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,078
said something that was surprising to me

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,910
you know normally everybody talks about

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,429
the health of the plant itself about

25
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,588
whether or not it can do 24 hours a day

26
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,030
of photosynthesis and be healthy but she

27
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,700
approached it totally different she's

28
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,099
like yeah the plant grows up faster and

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,439
bulkier but what you're doing is you are

30
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,179
starving the rhizosphere you're starving

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,309
all the microbes in the soil which makes

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,170
the plants super susceptible for all

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,540
these different kinds of diseases that's

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,368
a whole different approach so after the

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,040
panel I asked her to step aside with me

36
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:27,359
and get on camera and and the answer the

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,689
question so that I could bring it home

38
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:33,780
to you so that you could check it out so

39
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:36,750
this is dr. Chow Ray's answer if you are

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,030
into 24 hour lights or if you just like

41
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,719
thinking about photosynthesis I hope you

42
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,719
totally dig this

43
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,630
everybody so I am here at Indo Expo

44
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,439
Denver today and I just heard a

45
00:01:52,629 --> 00:02:01,199
fantastic presentation on microbes and

46
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:04,149
rhizosphere and and my guest today

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,100
caught me off guard by saying something

48
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,099
that kind of blew my mind about the 24

49
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:11,229
hour light cycle as you may know there's

50
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,759
a lot of fervent debate online about

51
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:16,060
whether or not you can grow cannabis

52
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:18,579
plants in the vegetative state for 24

53
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,580
hours a day lit the entire time so

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,560
having no dark period and there's a lot

55
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,020
of debate back and forth but but often

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,439
there is not a lot of evidence and then

57
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,730
I mean Karuna today and she has got some

58
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,219
very interesting things today about

59
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:34,929
metabolites so Karuna thank you so much

60
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,400
for joining me for a moment

61
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,709
hearing you speak today caught me

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,020
totally off guard and I was excited to

63
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,360
hear essentially for me

64
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,459
new information in this debate people

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,580
are having about the 24 hour light cycle

66
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,489
so please if you would teach us all your

67
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,670
thoughts on whether or not using light

68
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:58,870
on for 24 hours is helping or inhibiting

69
00:02:54,669 --> 00:03:00,518
growing cannabis plants asking this very

70
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,360
important question

71
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:10,810
well plants are like humans or any other

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:12,040
living beings we have they face a night

73
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,979
phase

74
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:18,439
they also behave differently in day and

75
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:21,379
night in the daytime they have the

76
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,780
sunlight where they are going to use

77
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,750
everything do you know synthesize sugars

78
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,599
food so to say and the plant is growing

79
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,669
at the same time the plant is also

80
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,280
putting down sugars through its roots to

81
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,839
the microbes in the soil right so then

82
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,949
it's also communicating with the

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,860
microbes at nighttime all these

84
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:45,109
activities will shut down and that kind

85
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,280
of metabolites so when I say sugars

86
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,080
there are different sugars there are

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,419
different metabolites that are released

88
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,300
by the plant roots and they actually

89
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:55,309
feed the microbes that they love so the

90
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,070
friendly microbes are the microbes that

91
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,900
will help the plant grow they are the

92
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,840
ones that are dependent on this plant

93
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,319
food now if you keep the plant in only

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,810
one cycle then you are depriving the

95
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,269
microbial population of one category of

96
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,750
food so while the plants are growing

97
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:17,600
tall they're growing in biomass it's not

98
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,850
exactly healthy for the entire plant and

99
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,520
it's rhizosphere that is one reason that

100
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,800
you give it a break so let the plant

101
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,349
flip the cycle and make the different

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,240
set of metabolites or not constantly

103
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,189
keep feeling the same metabolite - it's

104
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,460
rhizosphere microbes where the microbes

105
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:35,459
might be like

106
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:37,620
really overwhelmed with all these

107
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:40,500
metabolites being thrown at it in 24

108
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,329
hours so even though microbes in the

109
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,009
rhizosphere follow this kind of diagonal

110
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,740
cycle they are not used to seeing this

111
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,889
metabolize constantly constantly and

112
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,870
that is one reason I think that you

113
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,339
definitely have to give the plants a

114
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:58,019
break so so to make sure that I

115
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,199
understand you correctly when the lights

116
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:02,939
are on the plant is producing its sugars

117
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,550
and photosynthesis and everything that

118
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,579
it normally does for itself but when the

119
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,500
light goes off it pushes all the sugars

120
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:13,740
out to the rhizosphere and your

121
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,790
beneficial microbes and so if we're

122
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,460
running our lights for 24 hours we are

123
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:23,250
potentially starving our beneficial

124
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:26,759
microbes that are in the substrate and

125
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,870
and so in addition to so so so the first

126
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,699
thing that wouldn't be bad for the

127
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,889
cannabis plant would be we're starving

128
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,870
the beneficial microbes which then makes

129
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,009
the plant itself less robust because

130
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,439
it's got less microbes in the

131
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,870
rhizosphere what else is there anything

132
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,750
else that might happen to the plant

133
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,550
itself by not getting a break like like

134
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,860
like when we don't get a rest we get a

135
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,170
little delirious right right so the

136
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,980
plant is always in the mode that it has

137
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:55,140
to grow grow grow right might and gives

138
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,509
it a time to kind of rest relax a little

139
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,389
bit but now when you are just keeping it

140
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,649
on a 24 cycle the only thing it here

141
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,409
says keep growing 3

142
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:08,310
keep doing photosynthesis keep growing

143
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,919
pig and so in a way this is not natural

144
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:15,339
so I think the plants are going to be

145
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,168
stressed in that format so give your

146
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,299
plants a break don't keep them on a 24

147
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,939
hour cycle so that so technically that

148
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,280
that stress could express itself in a

149
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:27,730
lot of ways maybe decrease cannabinoids

150
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:33,819
or less resistance to lolled or pass or

151
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:36,939
however it chooses to express its life

152
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:40,839
cycle might be doing it very much indoor

153
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:42,850
grows but they have almost like sterile

154
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,549
environment they can keep it closed and

155
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:48,280
that's when they think that giving it 24

156
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,009
hour life cycle is giving them plants

157
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,289
which they think are better plants but

158
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:59,829
that plant is just kind of safe propped

159
00:06:53,290 --> 00:07:04,900
up a little bit so they're susceptible

160
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:08,620
to a wide range of things so so if the

161
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:10,359
24 like our light cycle is is setting up

162
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,780
the plant for potential failure right

163
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,288
the reason people do it is because you

164
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:20,379
can reach the end of the bloom cycle

165
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:22,149
about 20% faster right so for people who

166
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:24,699
are trying to do a certain number of

167
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:26,288
cycles a year for profit right yeah

168
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:30,459
they're saying we're just going to push

169
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:33,550
the plant to its extreme so that we can

170
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:37,349
save that 20% of time exactly how would

171
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:42,100
you weigh that yourself and the

172
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:45,180
advantages to saving 20% versus the the

173
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,860
susceptibility of the plant to pathogens

174
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,840
so let me put it this way

175
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,620
can save on the time and you can get

176
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,869
more butts or more flowering cycles but

177
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,168
what is the quality of your buds are you

178
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,408
sacrificing your terpene profile are you

179
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:05,468
sacrificing your cannabinoid profile

180
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:07,598
just to gain that 20% extra time is it

181
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:10,209
worth it so you have to keep that in

182
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,680
mind also to maintain this 24 hour life

183
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:14,378
cycle like I said you have to have

184
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,870
practically a staggering room everything

185
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:20,500
has to be so dialed in that you cannot

186
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,478
change little bit otherwise your plant

187
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,519
is going to just die or not perform as

188
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:30,128
good so you are creating so many

189
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:32,769
restrictive scenarios for growth whereas

190
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:34,149
under a normal cycle you are not your

191
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,679
plant is healthy enough that it can

192
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,958
withstand little bit of fluctuation that

193
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:44,078
is what you want and you can keep your

194
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:47,458
cannabinoid profile steady I have heard

195
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:51,569
very little about how the but quality is

196
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:54,549
if you are bringing it down to this very

197
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:57,910
short cycle I have not yet seen that

198
00:08:54,549 --> 00:09:02,019
date database like I said data is the

199
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:05,049
first thing I will look for oh this is

200
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,909
how it works show me right show me the

201
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:09,309
evidence and so far

202
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:10,839
so as far as the data because in your

203
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:14,139
presentation you were very clear that

204
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,210
data is everything would you share with

205
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:18,009
us some of the research that has been

206
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,930
done on this and we can put it in the

207
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:22,000
links below so that people can check it

208
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:24,339
out at home sure sure if I find

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,350
something on cannabis definitely if not

210
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,769
definitely on other plants I just find

211
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:33,879
out all those links on what effect is 24

212
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:37,169
hour photo period thank you so much

213
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,169
corona check it out thank you
