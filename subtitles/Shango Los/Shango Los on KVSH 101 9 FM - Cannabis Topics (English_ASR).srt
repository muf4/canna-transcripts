Shango um tell us well tell us your role

7
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:27,288
right now in in the field of cannabis

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,659
sure well a little bit all over the

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:32,390
place right now here on the island I

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,070
continued to be the founder of what was

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,378
the local trade organization on the

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,689
island the Vashon Island marijuana

13
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:40,549
entrepreneurs alliance but with the

14
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:42,678
recent changes in the dismantling of

15
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:45,108
medical marijuana in the state we've

16
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,149
actually changed our name to get in the

17
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:49,989
spirit of that so now we're the Vashon

18
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:54,069
Island marijuana enthusiasts Alliance

19
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:56,448
originally we played the role of helping

20
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:59,478
medical marijuana producers on the

21
00:00:56,448 --> 00:01:01,698
island find reliable and legal channels

22
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:04,939
to sell their products in the rest of

23
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:07,548
the state but since the medical industry

24
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:09,140
has been dismantled in the state there's

25
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,750
there's not much future in that anymore

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,750
so we switched over to the enthusiasts

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,040
alliance because now we're primarily an

28
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,109
education organization reaching out to

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,880
patients and and explaining marijuana

30
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,250
and and giving a lot of support for

31
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,439
patients on the island who don't know

32
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,840
where else to go so let's back up a

33
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,239
little bit tell us what the laws

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,730
regarding both medicinal and

35
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:35,839
recreational marijuana were before July

36
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:38,390
ok so so before July there were

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,870
recreational stores but there were also

38
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,659
um dedicated medical dispensaries that

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,850
were not licensed by the state and so

40
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,469
there was a competition between the

41
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:52,069
licensed stores and the unlicensed

42
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:55,420
stores and we had had medical in our

43
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:57,709
state for 18 years prior to this and

44
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,650
there were some concerns about the

45
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:02,149
competition from the recreational stores

46
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,210
and of course the state wanted to

47
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,940
capture more of their taxes and so they

48
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:09,829
decided that it was in our best interest

49
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:12,650
to dismantle the medical marijuana

50
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,900
stores and push those buyers to the

51
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,870
recreational stores and that finally

52
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,090
happened on in July as you said the

53
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,980
challenges is that while there

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,200
recreational stores will eventually have

55
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,859
them all the medical products they don't

56
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:30,289
have them yet no and so and the price is

57
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,970
much higher and so in the interim the

58
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:34,000
ones who are losing are our most

59
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:36,229
vulnerable population of patients

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,449
because they didn't have the political

61
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:41,149
strength that for-profit businesses did

62
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:43,488
to influence the legislature wow that's

63
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,069
interesting so the for-profit businesses

64
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:48,890
that sell recreational marijuana

65
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:52,578
basically prevailed certainly with the

66
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:55,159
state legislature and so are all the

67
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,989
medical dispensaries just out of

68
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,389
business yes they're they're all out of

69
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,829
business in fact we got a little press

70
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,109
here on Vashon a couple weeks ago

71
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:05,989
because our medical dispensary here on

72
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,870
the island never closed in july when

73
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:11,269
when the law changed simply because they

74
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,180
were never told the dispensaries were

75
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:16,189
were all sent letters from the state

76
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,560
saying the law has changed you must now

77
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:20,269
closed but you know we kind of slipped

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,370
through the cracks because we're in

79
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,079
unincorporated King County and so the

80
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,459
the article that was written about it

81
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,599
everybody was saying wasn't my

82
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,530
responsibility wasn't my responsibility

83
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,000
so anyway we had we had a the last

84
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,689
medical dispensary open in the state

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,120
until it until people noticed yeah so

86
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:40,939
what do you see as the future of legal

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,739
marijuana in Washington State well first

88
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,930
of all it's on the grow I mean every

89
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,389
month they're they're returning more and

90
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,669
more revenues as more people realize

91
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:52,370
that a lot of the the reefer madness

92
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:54,380
taboos of the last 50 years where we're

93
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,079
based on lies so so there are more and

94
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:00,709
more people preferring to enjoy cannabis

95
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,389
and and to you know often drink less as

96
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,848
well because even though alcohol is more

97
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:07,760
available it's it's more dangerous than

98
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:10,339
marijuana is expect and so but you know

99
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,340
even though I'm disappointed for the

100
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,229
patients for right now and every day I

101
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,418
work with patients who cannot find

102
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:19,399
access to the specialty cannabis

103
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:21,348
preparations that they look for I do

104
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,939
have faith that the recreational system

105
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:24,680
will come around because there's there's

106
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:26,240
people who are by these products it's a

107
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,699
family yeah but there's a there's a

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,009
matter of time for them to ramp up where

109
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,519
they can find the appropriate strains

110
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,409
hire people who know how to

111
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,478
the processes develop their package and

112
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,400
get him in the store and we're just

113
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,399
seeing the first inkling of that right

114
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,709
now but you know I figure a year from

115
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,568
now those products will exist like more

116
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:47,878
edibles and things of that nature that

117
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:51,300
so specifically probably Rick Simpson

118
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,259
oil very clean unflavored tinctures

119
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,180
because a lot of things in the

120
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,310
recreational store they're made for fun

121
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,550
and so they they add flavors and sugars

122
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,970
and you know real patients can't drink

123
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,069
THC infused soda pop um you know and so

124
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,599
um they there there's a lack we need

125
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:09,090
things that are stripped down and very

126
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:11,430
simple and not quite as sexy is a lot of

127
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,989
the stuff that's prep prep in the

128
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,459
recreational market right now so are

129
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,288
those preparations currently just

130
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,269
inaccessible for people who need them

131
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:20,339
medicinally um they're inaccessible

132
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:21,389
legally right so one you know

133
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,829
everybody's gone back to the black

134
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,949
market within the way they used to and

135
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:28,709
so you know if if you used to be on

136
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:31,439
seizure medication and then you got

137
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:34,318
turned on to medical cannabis prop

138
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,779
products and your seizures went away and

139
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,250
now the state says that you cannot have

140
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,769
those until they figure out how to

141
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,718
develop them and suddenly you're told to

142
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:44,579
go back to the pharmaceuticals most

143
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:46,620
patients are saying will forget that you

144
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,418
know the person that I used to buy from

145
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,098
in the medical industry is now just

146
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,568
selling out of their house and so I'm

147
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:55,379
going to continue to work with them and

148
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,908
so you're finding a lot more you know

149
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,310
what we call we like to call more though

150
00:05:56,908 --> 00:06:01,139
the informal market then what we think

151
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,240
of it as the black market but the black

152
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,639
markets got such a bad and sound do it I

153
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,288
mean these are these are kind medical

154
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,019
providers who are artisans in their

155
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:12,360
craft providing for other people who are

156
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,310
trying to get relief from their ailments

157
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,139
and for now since a lot of those

158
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,788
products are not in the recreational

159
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,800
market people are finding their healing

160
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:21,839
where they can are those people at risk

161
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,960
of prosecution for selling in the

162
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:30,299
informal market they are they are and

163
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:32,788
how how adamant is the state being about

164
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,000
seeking those folks out and prosecuting

165
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:38,639
them so far it seems to be selective

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,620
enforcement it depends on how you're

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,449
going about your business because it

168
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,180
does seem that the state understands

169
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,350
that there's a gap here for example they

170
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,420
rolled out this new policy

171
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,090
see where they were going to you know

172
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,990
essentially bless and certify all these

173
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:56,459
new recreational stores as being medical

174
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,170
but but you know there's only a handful

175
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,629
of those right now because the

176
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,300
regulations or the the how you apply is

177
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,490
so complex and burdensome financially to

178
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,870
the recreational producers and so the

179
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,730
state understands that there's this gap

180
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,579
right now and so there doesn't seem to

181
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,280
be a huge push to put all of these

182
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,129
patient and patient providers behind

183
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,739
bars that said the folks who are

184
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:24,269
producing huge commercial amounts of

185
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,980
plans or are you know also having fights

186
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:27,479
on their property and then when the

187
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,050
police come you know that they're there

188
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,330
are guns there and you know it's it's

189
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:36,600
the way the way the King County sheriff

190
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:38,490
said it was you know if if there's no

191
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,230
problem there's no problem but if

192
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,660
there's a problem there's a problem and

193
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:45,540
so in this kind of gray area that we're

194
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,700
in right now there doesn't seem to be a

195
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,189
lot of interest at the state level to go

196
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,310
after these small family businesses that

197
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:55,740
are trying to provide for patients now

198
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,829
when the rec stores get this you know

199
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,720
there's their shelves are filled with

200
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:04,069
you know cannabis medicine type products

201
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,480
we may see that change two questions

202
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,730
number one others cannabis medical

203
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,189
products going to increase in price and

204
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,340
number two can you give us a sense of

205
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:17,639
how many growers are still going on

206
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:19,139
Vashon um so so for certain the prices

207
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,629
are higher there's no doubt about that

208
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:27,000
because the state is is is charging a

209
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:29,310
tax on in both both a a like a syntax of

210
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,769
vice tax and then also just a simple

211
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,750
sales tax and also you know when you

212
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:37,529
when you knew who your medical provider

213
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,538
was as a person you would be able to

214
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,279
let's say for example you're you're

215
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:44,279
looking to cure your cancer and you need

216
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,309
60 grams of Rick Simpson oil if you go

217
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,699
at a retail recreational store you're

218
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:52,949
going to pay 60 times the price for one

219
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,589
gram whereas if you were going to a

220
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,910
medical person they'd say oh well hey

221
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,720
i'm going to give you a discount because

222
00:08:56,909 --> 00:09:00,159
your cancer patient and that's a

223
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,660
bag so we're gonna give you some money

224
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,088
off from that and since you're going to

225
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:05,679
buy 60 grams all at once we're also

226
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:07,389
going to give you you know a forty

227
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,250
percent discount because of a bulk

228
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:11,500
purchase but if you go to a recreational

229
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,429
store it's not like that it's 60 times

230
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,379
full price Wow and so um you know people

231
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,599
who are treating their cancer with

232
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:22,688
cannabis are absolutely getting their

233
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,209
medicine in the in the informal market

234
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:26,860
and then so your second question about

235
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:29,138
how many people are growing stole on the

236
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,629
island um you know the official answer

237
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:33,399
for you is zero right right but but you

238
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:35,649
know you go we know we know that's not

239
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,419
true though because fashions number one

240
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:40,028
cash crop for the last three years has

241
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:41,169
been cannabis so so we know that there

242
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:43,269
are you know we know that there are

243
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:46,149
growers on the island but they have all

244
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:48,039
returned to the to the shadows and deal

245
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,708
with smaller groups of people and

246
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,448
friends and things like that we have we

247
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:55,958
have several recreational growers on the

248
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:58,448
island like vashon velvet and Vashon

249
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,219
Island organics who are who are on the

250
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:01,929
island and represent us well in the

251
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,800
recreational market and have got very

252
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:07,328
very fine products but they you know

253
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,519
they don't necessarily spec they're not

254
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:13,750
processors so they are not preparing

255
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,578
these very specific medical value added

256
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,159
products they're growing really great

257
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:20,169
flower and then they pass them on to

258
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,698
processors and and then what the

259
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:24,009
processors do with it if there are their

260
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:26,588
own thing actually vashon velvet has got

261
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:28,688
this fantastic reputation because they

262
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:31,449
may not only are women owned and

263
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:34,299
operated they use LED lights that are

264
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:37,568
use much less electricity they recycle

265
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:39,609
their water and their their flower is so

266
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:40,719
exceptional that that they just roll

267
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,220
most of it into what are called

268
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,250
pre-rolls which we would think of as

269
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,500
joints and they sell them in in boxes

270
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,759
directly to the retailers and people

271
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,289
just love them and some people say that

272
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,110
they're they're the best pre-rolls in

273
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:55,179
the state and so so that's exciting do

274
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,110
they have to have a lot of security um

275
00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:00,789
well I would the short answer is yes

276
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,470
because all of the medical growers in

277
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:05,110
the state have got you know video

278
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,720
cameras and gates or wall or wall

279
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,220
buildings and all of the video is

280
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,379
streamed to the state so they can look

281
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,610
at it at every

282
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:16,960
so to that degree yes but but you know

283
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,940
you could be far worse you know it's not

284
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,620
like it's a it's a bank where they all

285
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,210
got armed guards are there or anything

286
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,919
I'm glad to hear that yes i would that

287
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,360
would not make the business fun i want

288
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,399
to back up just a little bit because you

289
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,610
said something that alluded to the

290
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:34,600
notion that rick simpson oil cures

291
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:38,680
cancer is that proven um well the first

292
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,300
answer is yes i have seen it happen with

293
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,620
patients first hand now when i first

294
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,949
started in this i had only heard it

295
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,870
anecdotally but now i have seen i have

296
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,420
directed patients to places where they

297
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,480
can get rick simpson oil they've used it

298
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:54,490
and their cancer has gone away so and

299
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,779
all they were doing was using cannabis

300
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:01,210
oil and getting vitamin d not injections

301
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,879
but what are getting vitamin D as well

302
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:07,090
and and so I've seen it now firsthand

303
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:09,279
now while these studies have not been

304
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,509
legal in the United States they have

305
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,250
been happening in Europe and

306
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:17,769
specifically in England and so cannabis

307
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:22,350
has been proven to interrupt the cancer

308
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:25,149
spread and to cause it to repeal back

309
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,060
decrease the activity and eventually

310
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:30,100
remove tumors too it's difficult to put

311
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:31,389
them all in the same bucket because

312
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,250
there's lots of different types of

313
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:36,689
cancer right so for example when you're

314
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:40,120
using cannabis oil to fight lymphoma

315
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,340
you're going to shrink down the tumors

316
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,590
to you know a one or two percent of what

317
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,740
they were originally but often they

318
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:50,080
won't go away but you'll get tests tests

319
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,740
every three months and you'll you'll see

320
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,200
that they're not growing whereas other

321
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,490
more aggressive types of cancer you know

322
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,350
canvas might not be that effective

323
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,350
against simply because canvas doesn't

324
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,540
have enough time to help the cancer that

325
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,909
because the the course for for beating

326
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:08,620
cancer is three months and so you know

327
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:10,569
if somebody if you get someone who

328
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,389
staged for with an aggressive cancer it

329
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:17,110
may be too late for them but we're

330
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:18,789
really excited by all of the the true

331
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,690
scientific studies that are coming out

332
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:23,949
of Europe that show that that cannabis

333
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,560
stops and or

334
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,500
jurors cancer and you know the the

335
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,149
government has got a patent on using

336
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,730
cannabis to cure cancer and they have

337
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:35,529
for a couple decades o our government

338
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,259
yeah the US government holds this patent

339
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,179
and that's just a willing to talk about

340
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:43,240
it didn't they just legalize cannabis

341
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:46,049
research for medicinal purposes yeah

342
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,389
that really I'd say that's accurate

343
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:53,139
statement they have they have opened up

344
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:55,689
the the application process to let a

345
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:57,549
certain amount of institutions apply so

346
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,530
it's not just everybody it's still very

347
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:00,759
controlled but yes the increase that

348
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:03,250
they have decided to move forward with

349
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,769
the research we're talking with the

350
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,600
cannabis expert Shango Louis excuse me

351
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:10,350
Luke as we had a question no I said

352
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,580
that's good news it is good news and I

353
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,129
didn't know that all that research was

354
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,870
coming out of Europe if people want to

355
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:21,399
learn more about it the the website that

356
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:25,210
I direct patients to is project CBD dot

357
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,980
o RG it's a wonderful website run by our

358
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,650
friends at project CBD down in

359
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:32,170
California and they have done a lot of

360
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:33,699
the hard research for us if you go to

361
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:35,529
the website there's a section that says

362
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,960
conditions and then if you click on

363
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:39,669
conditions it shows you this a whole

364
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,530
page list of all the different

365
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:43,360
conditions that cannabis helps with and

366
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,360
when you click on the particular

367
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,379
condition it gives you links to all of

368
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,389
the scientific studies in pubmed.gov

369
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:55,419
showing the support for cancer helping

370
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:58,809
with Alzheimer's and cancer and

371
00:14:55,419 --> 00:15:01,179
arthritis and autism and I mean it's a

372
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:04,509
it's an amazing list you know cannabis

373
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:06,809
was the primary part of the

374
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,799
pharmacopoeia before it was banned

375
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:10,569
suddenly you know we've been using

376
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,479
cannabis for generations upon

377
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,970
generations and then suddenly for for

378
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,250
political reasons you know they banned

379
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,170
it and and then the pharmaceutical

380
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,000
companies jumped in to fill the void so

381
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:24,189
they could sell their products well now

382
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,419
with the taboo decreasing and people

383
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,340
starting to realize more and more that

384
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:30,269
we were lied to for political reasons

385
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:34,030
people are realizing that the the old

386
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:35,710
reliable herb of marijuana is something

387
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:37,649
that that we should get back to using

388
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,528
and you know and you know it's not

389
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:43,078
addictive it is no one has ever died

390
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:44,399
from it it's very safe i mean the worst

391
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,948
thing that can happen is you can

392
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,049
accidentally overmedicate and and maybe

393
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:50,998
be uncomfortable and kind of paranoid

394
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:53,609
for 45 minutes I mean if that's your

395
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:55,558
worst symptom that's way better than any

396
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,220
other options for most of these ailments

397
00:15:55,558 --> 00:16:00,990
that website does it have recipes on

398
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,119
there because I know that there's lots

399
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,209
of different combinations of what what

400
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:08,490
type of mixture that you give for each

401
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,169
type of medical condition do they have

402
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,269
those recipes on there or do you have to

403
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,099
sort of figure that out on your own or

404
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,499
are there places that you can actually

405
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,269
get specific stuff for specific ailments

406
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:21,720
you know this you that is a question

407
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,129
that's right on the edge of the kind of

408
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,019
information that's available publicly

409
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:27,480
mean this is this is what I teach I

410
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,149
speak often to doctor and natural path

411
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,039
groups explaining so before this ailment

412
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,619
you want to have something that's this

413
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,618
this many milligrams of THC in this many

414
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:39,089
milligrams of CBD oh and so and some

415
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:40,559
things you want to treat with more of an

416
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,300
indica strain and some things you want

417
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:44,159
to treat with more of a sativa strain to

418
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,479
talk your talk real generally about it

419
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,990
and so I don't know if that's

420
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,980
specifically on the project CBD org

421
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:55,850
website it's certainly inside of the the

422
00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:00,240
studies that they're quoting for example

423
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:03,778
in in the UK they have a drug made by GW

424
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,230
pharmaceutical called Sativex and it is

425
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:08,429
used by patients and but but really if

426
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,558
you look at if you look what the

427
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:14,059
ingredients is it's it's simply a

428
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:17,129
one-to-one preparation of THC and CBD at

429
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:20,129
at three like three and a half

430
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,350
milligrams per dose and and use until

431
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,640
you have relief I mean heck we have

432
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,648
people on the island who make that as a

433
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,140
tincture you know and and it didn't have

434
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:30,028
to go through all of the laborious you

435
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,940
know whatever the british version of the

436
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:35,190
fda is um but but it's the way that

437
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,980
nature intended that healing to happen

438
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,919
instead of the the repackaging it as a

439
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,179
pharmaceutical product so so I know that

440
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,100
that's a long answer your question but

441
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,288
here you know but you know well I have

442
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:50,119
to admit that I was I had a really

443
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:51,829
severe back prod spinal stenosis and

444
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,750
lasted about two years until I couldn't

445
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:57,289
take any more and finally got surgery so

446
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,549
I was a green card recipient and some of

447
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,619
the things I was trying to specifically

448
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,720
I didn't want to get necessarily high

449
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:04,549
but I wanted to relieve some of the pain

450
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,930
and not take all the oxycodone or

451
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:09,019
anything that kind of medicine that

452
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,610
really was worse for me so I I was

453
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,710
having a difficult time finding that

454
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:16,209
particular combination that would really

455
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:19,430
help there wasn't a real hard and fast

456
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,840
recipe that I could use every time you

457
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,120
know I'd go to the medical marijuana

458
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:26,480
place and a lot of times there be you

459
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:29,299
know edibles were more what I would

460
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,799
light and rather do but that I found a

461
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,928
hard time getting to know what those

462
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,789
combinations were and what the balances

463
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:36,110
were and you know you're not alone with

464
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:38,178
what you're asking is a pretty

465
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:40,129
sophisticated question and is going to

466
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,300
be out of the experience of a lot of the

467
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,270
bud tenders that you would have spoken

468
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,919
to so for example number one um it was

469
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:47,359
certainly wouldn't recommend smoking

470
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,308
cannabis for that that is something that

471
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,919
you're going to want a tincture for or

472
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:53,509
potentially an edible I'm second because

473
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,789
you've got heavy neuropathic pain you're

474
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:57,470
going to want a lot of CBD in there to

475
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:59,058
boost your endocannabinoid system

476
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,850
because there's a there's you know

477
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:04,009
signaling issues mixed in with that and

478
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:07,069
then you were probably you know had had

479
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,629
actual physical pain issues and probably

480
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:10,279
especially at night because if you

481
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,200
rolled over you had pain with and woke

482
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,599
you up so then you have insomnia which

483
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,370
then I would recommend an indica

484
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,079
tincture on top of that to act as a

485
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:19,879
muscle relaxant and help you sleep and

486
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:23,480
so then so then I would have suggested

487
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,150
you know 10 to 20 milligrams of CBD a

488
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,558
day with a little bit of THC in there to

489
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,990
take advantage of the entourage

490
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,759
effectiveness how they work together and

491
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,920
then in the evening and indica tincture

492
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,079
to help your body relax and help you

493
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,789
slip into sleep boom but not a lot of

494
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,849
people have that level of sophistication

495
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:44,109
at the retail level well or that kind of

496
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:48,319
information because they're obviously

497
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:49,549
you're clear on how all this works we're

498
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,599
talking with Shango loves who is a

499
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:55,339
cannabis expert and vashon island ER you

500
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,069
just SAT here and gave a prescription

501
00:19:55,339 --> 00:20:01,279
for stenosis pain which is fairly

502
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:03,619
complex I'm curious about how many

503
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,710
American physicians are

504
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:09,079
are latching on to this idea and

505
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,680
actually prescribing Canopus for cancer

506
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:15,230
or for spinal pain or other kinds of

507
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:20,150
pain well conditions the folks who both

508
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:23,180
know how to recommend a particular

509
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,490
cannabis preparation and are in favorite

510
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,160
they could probably fit in this room and

511
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:30,579
luckily though the number of doctors who

512
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,680
are becoming in favor of cannabis is

513
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:35,599
increasing greatly and the kind of

514
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,100
information that they need to feel

515
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,099
empowered to make these recommendations

516
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:43,329
are increasing and the likelihood of

517
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:45,740
them running into an insurance problem

518
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:48,199
practicing recommending cannabis is

519
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,170
decreasing and so we're on the right

520
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,539
side of history but there is not a lot

521
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,820
of it now a lot of not there's not a lot

522
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:57,409
of folks recommending that now and and

523
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:59,029
that those are the folks that i talked

524
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,070
to all the time because they don't even

525
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,928
necessarily want it to go on their

526
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:04,789
resume that they've learned this stuff

527
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,940
but their patients are asking about it

528
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:10,159
and so I am very often invited to you

529
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,330
know private homes where there's going

530
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,220
to be a room there's going to be a

531
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:15,379
couple you know Western doctors a couple

532
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,110
naturopaths a couple of nurses maybe a

533
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,360
patient or to somebody who's significant

534
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:22,219
other is really sick and so we just sit

535
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,049
around and talk and and I teach what I

536
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,839
have learned during my years of doing

537
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,789
this and so they have a better frame of

538
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,230
reference to put all the other

539
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,210
information that they're learning

540
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,980
because there's so much noise everybody

541
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,429
wants to talk about Canada and most of

542
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,980
the information is very low quality yeah

543
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:45,230
Wow Shango lows you are the president of

544
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:48,710
the imea vashon vashon island marijuana

545
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:51,470
enthusiasts a lot Alliance yes and you

546
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:55,039
have a fairly beyond the island career

547
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,079
as well in the in cannabis information

548
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,909
sure sure education outlook and now it's

549
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,699
about leaning more towards media so I

550
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:04,279
was doing a lot of brand strategy and

551
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,400
startup business consulting for medical

552
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,678
companies when they existed and then and

553
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,810
then they went away and then so and I've

554
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,420
worked with some recreational producers

555
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:15,769
as well but during the transition i

556
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,420
found that

557
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,980
what I had to offer him even though I've

558
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,130
you know I'm a lifelong brand strategist

559
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,660
and and and can talk business the part

560
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,570
that I had that was valuable was the

561
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,970
experience with cannabis business

562
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:30,500
specifically the development of products

563
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,000
and working with patients because that's

564
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,740
where my passion is working sounds

565
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,240
itions yeah I just you know I talked to

566
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,490
patients every day on the island who

567
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,680
come to me for advice and to get

568
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,940
direction about where they can get these

569
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,180
medicines either through the

570
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,759
recreational stores or elsewhere and and

571
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:50,600
so I moved into media so I've got I've

572
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:52,039
got a podcast at shaping fire calm that

573
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:55,399
one is actually launching in a week I

574
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,680
recently just left my role as a founder

575
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,050
of the podcast at ganj preneur calm I

576
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,370
did fifty four episodes for them but

577
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,690
decided it was time to go out on my own

578
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:05,719
so I could have a little more control

579
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,990
sure and so so shaping fire is going to

580
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,100
launch here in two weeks and I'm and I I

581
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,750
travel the country a lot spending a lot

582
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:17,439
of time in California right now teaching

583
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,480
both cannabis business owners and also

584
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:26,000
patients and sharing what I've what I've

585
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,670
learned so whoa okay you go okay I um

586
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,039
are there any stores in and I'm not

587
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,690
asking you necessary to name them per se

588
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,789
but are there some stores that have sort

589
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,220
of gotten on the bandwagon with medical

590
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:39,740
products marijuana products in Seattle

591
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,069
that patients here like on Vashon can go

592
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,799
to the short answer is yes the long

593
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:48,409
answer is no because the problem is is

594
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,990
that the stores may be on board but um

595
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,540
there's not enough being produced that

596
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,630
they can keep it on their shelves and so

597
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:58,700
you know they might get in some some

598
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,570
Rick Simpson oil and people notice it

599
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,900
and they tell their friend and they're

600
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:05,419
sold out in a day and so um so there are

601
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,950
there are there are like for example you

602
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,170
know Seattle cannabis company you know

603
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,600
they're there right off the the west

604
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,250
seattle bridge and you know they've got

605
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,199
a great staff that does you know that

606
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,730
educates folks but but they have a hard

607
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,580
time keeping this stuff on the shelf and

608
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,779
so we need more processors to produce

609
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:27,049
more of this medical product so that it

610
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:28,549
becomes available but you know nearby

611
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,569
you know we've got three directions

612
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,889
where we can take

613
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:33,379
fairies you know south you're right I

614
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,360
don't and the south end and so there are

615
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,250
there are recreational stores on all

616
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,679
three ends and you know we're to the

617
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,450
point now that we're just we being the

618
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,740
Vashon Island marijuana enthusiasts

619
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,710
Alliance we're just starting to develop

620
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:49,339
relationships with these folks so that

621
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,019
we can recommend them confidently i mean

622
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:52,879
i can i can say nice things about

623
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:56,240
seattle cannabis company on first

624
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,190
because I'm friends and I know several

625
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,750
of the bud tenders there and they come

626
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,059
out to vimeo meetings and i know they're

627
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,220
doing their own education and so so i

628
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:05,629
know that their fourth right folks who

629
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,190
are doing a good job so you know we

630
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,960
don't have a relationship with them but

631
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,430
there are more and more of the

632
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,490
